Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed this book for you, O Sons, which is the last one in the science of medicine along with its complement, and after I have reached the end in it through its expositions and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since operation with the hand is prostrate in our region and at our time completely, until perhaps it has perished, and its trace has vanished; and only small descriptions of it remain in the books of the ancients, which have been corrupted by hands; and error and hesitation occurred to them until their intentions were closed, and the force was elongated; It seemed to me that I should bring it to life with the arrangement of this Treatise according to its position, declaration, and abbreviation; and to come with the shapes of the tools of the Cautery, and the remaining instruments of work; which is made by addition from the declarations, and by the properation of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a good craftsman of this art with his hand is not found in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained before that in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the help for the members, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, and their number, and their exit, and the pulses of veins and arteries, and their quiets, and their locations.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for this reason Hippocrates said that much is the name with the name, and little is the work, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 We have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Since one who does not know what we have said about anatomy will fall into error and kill men, as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 Because I saw a foolish doctor cut off a scrofulous apostema on a woman's neck and cut some arteries in the neck; therefore, the woman bled to death until she fell dead in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I saw another doctor who presumed to remove a stone from an old man who had passed his prime, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore he came to him and removed it with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And indeed I had already been summoned to remove it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 And I saw another doctor who was receiving a stipend from one of our land's dukes because of medicine; and a black eunuch was with him, who sustained a fracture near his heel; and the doctor, with his ignorance, bound up the fracture over an ulcer with pulley irons and tightened it strongly, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he cured him according to his devices.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Afterwards he dismissed him for some days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage; and he stood thus until the apostema grew on his leg, and his foot, and came to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 Therefore I was summoned to him; and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and peace came upon him, and he was released from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 The corruption had already been confirmed in the member; and I could not prevent it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Then, the corruption ceased to walk around in the member, until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous boil; and it ulcerated for days, until the wickedness of it with its lord was manifested.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 This is because when it is a pure cancer from black bile, then it is not fitting to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can bear it, so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And for that reason, according to O Filii, it is necessary for you to know that an operation is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation which is associated with safety; and the operation with which there is danger in many arrangements.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already awakened in every place of this book where the operation comes that has fear and terror.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for you to be careful of that and divide it yourself so that fools do not find a way to talk and disgrace.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Therefore, take the measure with care and protection, and take care of your weak ones with ease and firmness, and use a better way leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy success; and let go of fearsome illnesses difficult to cure; and remove yourselves from that which makes you afraid, so that hesitation in faith and your comfort may not enter upon you.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more for your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galenus has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat evil sickness; do not be called a bad physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters. ¶
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On cautery with fire and cautery with sharp medicine, this chapter is arranged, from the head to the feet, and on the shapes of instruments and tools for cauterization, as well as everything that is necessary during the procedure. [Paragraph break]
Capitulum secundum.	 De incisionibus generaliter: et de incisione capitae, et
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 Chapter Two. [Paragraph break] On general incisions and the incision of the head, [paragraph break] On section and perforation, phlebotomy and ventosities, and wounds; as well as extraction of arrows and similar objects: and all arranged in the shapes of instruments. [Paragraph break]
Capitulum tertium.	 De cauterio cum igne et Cauterio cum medicina acuta,
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 Chapter Three. [Paragraph break] On cautery with fire and cautery with sharp medicine, [paragraph break] On restoration, dislocation, treatment of twisting, and similar cases: arranged from the head to the feet, and on the shapes of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 [Paragraph break] On the benefit and harm of cautery; when it is suitable, and at what time; whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter One. [Paragraph break] De Iuuamento
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 Before I remember the procedure with it, however, it is necessary to say the quality of its benefits and harms, and in what constitution it should be used. [Paragraph break] Chapter One. [Paragraph break] On the benefit.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I therefore say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit and harm of cautery is a long, subtle, scientific, and hidden knowledge. [Paragraph break] Chapter One. [Paragraph break] On the benefit.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 And there was much wisdom spoken about it and they disagreed on it; and for me, enough from their words is sufficient, fearing prolongation. [Paragraph break] Chapter One. [Paragraph break] On the benefit.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I therefore say that cautery applies universally to all constitutions, whether with matter or without; except for two constitutions, which are a hot constitution without matter, and a dry constitution without matter. [Paragraph break] Chapter One. [Paragraph break] On the benefit.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 In a hot and dry composition, they separated from the matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some say that Cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others say the opposite, that Cautery is not appropriate in a disease which is due to heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat; it is inappropriate to cure a hot and dry disease with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who says the opposite said that Cautery is beneficial for every hot and dry disease which occurs in human bodies, because when you compare a human body and its humors, according to the constitution of fire, you find a cold body in humans.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I myself say through his speech, because I have already seen that many times confirmed to me.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 Nevertheless, it is not necessary for him to come upon it unless he who has already been tested and trained in the last chapter on Cautery, and knows the diversity of human constitutions, the disposition of diseases in themselves, their causes, their qualities, their accidents, and the duration of the diseases.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 Concerning the other constitutions, there is no fear for you: and especially for cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 Indeed, all physicians agree on these: and they have not separated from the benefit when using Cautery for them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, my children, that from the secret of curing by Cautery with fire, and the goodness of it over Cautery with medicine burning, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member being cauterized; and it does not harm another part joined with it unless it causes a slight damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of medicine burning reaches to that which is extended from the limbs; and perhaps it causes a difficult-to-heal disease in the member, and perhaps it kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 Fire, on account of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that except when it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 We have now come to know that (something), through experience, because of the length of service and study with art, and due to its conformity to truth: and because of this I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not forbidden to this book of mine, I would bring you the secret hidden in fire and the quality of its operation in expelling bodies, which expels diseases with a philosophical explanation demonstrated, which could be understood by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, sons, that they themselves differ in the time when cautery is to be done, and they put a better time for it according to truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that cautery is suitable at any time: therefore, because the damage caused by time is submerged in the benefit which is attracted by the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if cautery is for pain due to necessary pains, strong, sharp ones that do not tolerate delay: therefore because it is feared that from them there might occur a greater mischief than the small damage caused by time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And let not that enter your minds, sons, that it is not thought except by the common people and foolish doctors, namely that to the ailment which is cured by cautery there is no return: and they put this as a consequence, and things are not so as they think: therefore because cautery is not unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion, and extracts humidities which are the cause, that why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However, cautery is superfluous over medicine because of the rapidity of its health and virtue of operation and the force of its dominion: and it is possible that the ailment returns an hour of time according to the complexion of the sick person, the location of the ailment, and the power of the ailment: and what is prepared in his body from accumulation of superfluities in it: and what comes upon him in acquisition of his body from foods and similar things from causes, unless an ailment occurs, for which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 Subtle ailment in a member of few superfluities and moistures, like the cautery of a tooth, due to pain, and similar to it, is possibly such that the pain does not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But this happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 However, the common saying that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is correct only to what they intend by it, because they believe that there is no healing brought about with medication nor with anything else after the fall of the cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But this is contrary to their intention, and the saying that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is not true, unless when we administer ways of healing for some ailments, these medications do not help; then we administer cautery at the end, and it helps; thus it comes about that cautery is the last of medicines, not in accordance with the understanding of the common people and most foolish doctors.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this unless for the equality of gold, and the subtlety of its substance; and they said that it does not make a wound in the place of cauterizing.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 This is not absolutely true; for I have proven this and found that it does not do this in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 But when you heat the cautery with fire from gold, it is not shown to you when heated according to the amount that you wish, due to the redness of gold; and when it goes towards it, coldness comes about, and if you add more heating on top of this, it liquefies in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore, the craftsman falls into this mistake; and for this reason we use cautery with iron more quickly and closely among us in accordance with correctness for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I myself have already arranged this Chapter on cautery, according to the Chapters: and I have arranged it from head to feet: so that one may alleviate what the inquirer wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 On the method of cauterizing the Head at the Coronal Suture.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 The cauterization here is applied to the dominion of moisture and coldness on the brain: which are two causes of scurvy, and of the flux of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and of sleepiness, and toothache, and throat pain: and universally of all illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, scurvy, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ones caused by these illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is that you order the sick person to: evacuate his head first with a solution of medicine cleansing it for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient and his age and habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then order him to make his head with a linen cloth.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Whenever therefore your middle finger comes to a place, mark that place with unburnt (material).
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then oil the Cautery Iron; of which this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it on the marked unburnt place with a downward pressure, by which your hand is gradually tightened and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then quickly lift your hand and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that a piece of bone or quantity of flesh has been burnt off the skull or forehead, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another one if it becomes cold: until the bones that I told you appear.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and immerse the dressing in it, and place it over the location: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place the dressing soaked in butter over it, and leave it until the burn is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with a four-ingredient ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 They have said that the more an ulcer remains open, the more pus it discharges; wherefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone; and the cautery should be held until something is burned through the thickness of the bone.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then file off what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 And others say that when the cautery reaches the bone, it should leave an impression on it for as long as the bone falls out like the shape of a scab: or an instrument that women use to apply to the small alphabet letter: and they believe that steam from the head will escape from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then treat it until it becomes firm.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 But these two types of cautery do not seem to me at all useful except in some people, according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And leave it alone, in my opinion, it is better for his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 The head is weakened by the solution of its own natural continuity; as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head is naturally weak and frail; and the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: so operate with it for the benefit.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 On the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the entire head.
Caput III.	 Caput III. Inhibetur ut perforatio
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 Chapter III. It is forbidden to perform perforation when there is chronic pain in the whole head and it persists in sickness, and uses herbs, oils, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery as we have said, and none of those [remedies] help him, then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head of the sick person is strong by nature and not weak, and it finds very cold: then cauterize with another cautery under it scarcely.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize it on all its horns of the head with a cautery, so that the skin is not penetrated, and a quantity of bone is excavated as we have said.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And cauterize it with one cautery on the back of the head at the place called vase; it is a place where a vent is placed; pour your oil into this and do not excavate the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 The sick person finds it because of that very violent pain, and it is different from the pain of all other cauteries on the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 I will say that this cautery is in its place; it must be a cautery used for the horns of the head and the back of the head more finely with a cautery used for the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 On the method of cauterizing for hemicrania, both with burnt medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When there is pain and swelling in the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and further treatment is administered as I have said in the divisions of diseases, but it does not improve fully: then cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning acute medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cauterization with a burning acute medicine is: take one alum, peel it and cut off the ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then, make an incision in the time of pain with a broad lancet at the place of pain until there is a cavity under the skin where the tooth can be captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Insert it then into the cavity under the skin and let it be covered; then apply a suitable amount of pressure on top of it with a plaster and leave it for fifteen hours, then dissolve it and extract the alum, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterwards, place over it a hot compress submerged in butter until the place becomes pus-filled; then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to do this with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on remedies for wounds.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 Cauterization with iron is as follows:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 Hot Iron Cautery, whose shape is as follows.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 And it is called Clauilis: because its head's shape is like a nail, in which there is something hollow, and in the middle of it there is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the location, and hold your hand; and you turn the iron slowly with swiftness; and let the quantity that is to be burnt be equal to its thickness.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And lift your hand so that the artery, which is below, is not burnt, and let there be a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then immerse the cotton in salt water, and place it on the location, and leave it for three days; then immerse the cotton with butter; afterwards take care with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this hemicania with the tip of the second type of Cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 Be careful not to cut the artery in this hemicania, except for an old one specifically.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 [Title] On the method of cauterization in old hemicania.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When curing a hemicania, if the treatment mentioned from the previous cure and what was said in the division of diseases does not help: and you see from the illness that what we said with the first cautery or with cautery and fire is insufficient, then it is necessary to use cauterium ignis cultellare until it becomes white after marking the location of pain with a line, whose length is half a digit, or approximately so: and place your hand instead of one, and tighten it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 It is necessary that you beware of the hinge part of the jaw, which moves during chewing, so as not to burn the side or the nerve that moves it, thus causing a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And beware of the flow of blood from the artery which was cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 Indeed, the fear is in its cutting and especially to him who does not know what he does, and is not diligent, nor experienced; and he dismisses the operation first with it.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 I will come again with a reminder of the management of bleeding from the cut artery according to its manner, and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see from the illness that this cautery is insufficient and you see the weak body enduring cautery in the middle of the head as we said, then cure the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish, administer the cautery which we said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 For indeed cauterization is better and more effective by this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 Chapter on the manner of cauterizing ear pain.
Caput VI.	 Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When there is pain in the ear due to cold and it is treated with solvents, and with the remaining cure as we said in the division, but the pain does not subside, then cauterize with fire: this is called a puncture, whose form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then make small incisions around the entire ear, after its ignition (burning), as it is being rotated; or around both ears, if the pain is on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 Then burn the base of the ear slightly with the cautery after marking the spots with pitch; and let the size of the cautery be ten small points on each ear, and so forth.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then take care that they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 Chapter on the mode of cauterization for tortures.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 The torture that is cured with cauterization, is not other than those accidents due to phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And let us avoid cauterizing the species that occur from exhaustion, and from spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When you cure this species of torture with hiruses (leeches) and purges (medications to expel waste matter) and gargarisms (mouthwash), and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the weak one with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little below its time (a unit of measure), and third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your cautery on the weaker side of the affected area.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Since softening does not occur, unless in the healthy part that appears.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the shape of cauterization is to cauterize the same with a straight cautery at the base of the upper edge of the ear below the corner of the head, and another at its time (the point), whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin has been burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the shape of a cautery and it belongs to the type with a blade (small knife), whose form is as follows: but it should not be too thin, as you see; and it is necessary that the blade is in it without being excessively thick.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then cure the location (area) with what has been previously mentioned until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for ancient apoplexy (sudden loss of consciousness caused by a lack of blood supply to the brain).
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When ancient apoplexy occurs and your treatment does not help with what has been previously mentioned, and the patient does not have a fever, then you should cauterize him with four cauteries over all of his cornus (horns) of the skull, and a cautery in the middle of his head, as we have said, and a cautery on the back of his head, according to what has been previously mentioned; and the method of cauterization should be as previously described.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also, it is cauterized over the mouth of the stomach with a cautery; and this is more ultimate.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then it will be cured, with what has gone before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 § On the method of cauterizing in obliteration.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that in a drink there are first, large amounts of hyssop, and purifying pills for the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then, shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on his head a plaster made from henna described in the plasters' treatise; apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For that is the method of cautery: do it according to the same order as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If he is cured by this (method), it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not (cured): then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which are descending from the top of his head to the lower part of his eye; place a thickness of finger between each cautery.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then, after care for the cautery, do as before (with the purifying pills).
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If you wish an additional treatment and the sick person can tolerate it: then make a cautery in the middle (of the wound or affected area).
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 And if you want an additional treatment: then cauterize it above both horns (of the skull).
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then, care for it until he is cured: and let the cautery be anointed according to the shape mentioned before (with oil).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 It is necessary that you proceed in the mundification of the head with hyson, and with what has been said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then scrape the head of the sick person: afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over all the horns of the head, and with a cautery over the back part of it, and three over the spondyles of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If, however, you need the softening of the body by many of these things, and the sick person is weak and the illness is strong: then cauterize it with four cauteries over the spondyles of the back, and the last one with a cautery, until most of its skin is burned off, and let go of your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then take care of him until he is well: thus cauterize Olive oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 A person with epilepsy should not be cauterized, unless his epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you clean the brain of the patient first with hirses (a type of plant used for cleansing) and with the rest of the treatment as we have said earlier: when the patient is seriously ill or is resistant to medications.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If the patient is a child who cannot tolerate medications, then gargarisma (a type of mixture) is administered and cleansing mastications are given to clean the brain before that for many days with good food provision.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with a single cautery on the mid-point of his head according to what has been previously described; and cauterize another place on his occiput (the back part of the skull), and over all the horns of his head with cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with cauteries as previously described in the presence of paralysis, and apply mollification to his body over the spondylus (a type of vertebra) of the neck and dorsum (back part): and oil the cautery according to the method that has been previously described.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	 If the patient is a child, then place a subtle cautery according to this method.

Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and gross phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that have been mentioned in the presence of paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of slopes leading to melancholy and the body of the patient is damp, then give him a drink that cleans his brain, according to what has been previously mentioned earlier: then shave the head of the patient, and afterward make a well-centered turban from linen, similar to a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it in the middle of the head: and a weak person sitting square should hold it from every side.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then apply the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 And it is more suitable from ancient butter of sheep.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 And heat it above a fire with moderated temperature, as much as a finger can bear when it is inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then evacuate it from the middle of his head in a circle, and let it out until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 Do this to the weak one once a week with the rest of his good regime, until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small holes in it, except that you should keep your hand with the cautery; preferably use something that smells good.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	 For this kind of cauterization moistens the brain with its nature.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	 Then place on top of it a plate soaked in butter or goose fat.

When you are informed about the beginning of water in the eye by the signs that I said in the division, then begin and clean the weak person's head with him.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him away from all moistness, and make him sit in a bath, for some days in fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his own head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then cauterize him on both temples with two cauteries, if there is no opening for the descent of water in both eyes at once: or from one side, if there is an opening of water in one eye: and cut with cautery all veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in width like the temples: and avoid bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see something from it, then immediately cut it with any medicine that is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the removal of arteries, and cutting of them, and caution against bleeding.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	 And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under two bones, with two lastly produced cauteries.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When the tears of the eyes are old and continuous: and they are above veins and arteries that are manifestly on the outside of the head, it is verified that this is from superfluitates frigidarum phlegmaticarum: then cauterize with the same cautery as I have mentioned in the opening of water, cauterizing in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries on both temples, and with two cauteries on the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if it is necessary to add, then cauterize him carefully on all sides of the eye, above the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

When you treat it (the patient), as we said in the division, and the medication does not improve: then rush and give infirmocochia for three nights; afterward shave its head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with oil-based cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	 Then cauterize it (the head) with two cauteries and a medium cautery, on top of the eyebrows slightly beneath the hairs.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	 And take care not to cut the artery.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for softening the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	 When the eyelid of the eye becomes softened due to illness or humidity, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this moon-shaped cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish, cauterize it (the head) above the eyebrows slightly in all parts with two cauteries; and they should extend from the temples; and let the length of the entire cautery be equal to the length of the eyebrows; and do not move your hand with the cautery, but rather according to the amount that is being heated, the third part of the eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	 And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of moon-shaped cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn inwards and poke the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The instrument (cautery) is of two kinds: either a hot cautery, or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 For the hot cautery, instruct the patient to shave beforehand if he is one who cleans himself, until they (hairs) extend and become even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If (they perform the cautery) at its origin: then bind his eyes with an ointment, so that they do not move, until they (wounds) grow.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they grow and become even, then place the head of the patient in your lap: then mark over the eyelids of his eyes with encaustic, marking that it is in the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place a warm vessel filled with egg white or slippery elm gum on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then heat the cautery, which has this shape.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize gradually on the marked places in many spots, until the surface of the skin becomes burned to a depth equal to the shape of a myrtle leaf in its entirety.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the sign of your health is: if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and hairs growing at the site of cautery.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then withdraw your hand: and release him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place a warm vessel with butter on it until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If some hair returns after an hour and the eyelid becomes softened: then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did before.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If the hairs are in the lower part (of the eyelid): then cauterize it, until they grow back to their natural position; and it becomes even so that the hairs do not touch the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	 Method of cauterizing with burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	 Head Eighteenth.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 It is to be commanded to the sick person that he lets his hair grow until they become long and equal.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make a leaf shape out of paper from cloth in the form of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from known soap and unmixed lime each a weight of an ounce or about that: then grind them together with good grinding, and make it quickly so that it does not become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then, from that (substance) spread it out on the cloth you have made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over one or both eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 Then pour the substance soaked in egg white onto a plate, and keep the head of the sick person in your arms.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 Place your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 You move (the medicine) whenever the sick person feels the bite of the medicine, because its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While it continues to feel that bite, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the bite subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 Then consider if the eyelid rises like it is raised by heat or incision, that is good: and if not, then apply the medicine again to the same place where the medicine does not press and does not discolor, until your treatment is even and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then place the substance soaked in butter on it until the skin of the burn is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with a diaphine ointment or another ointment until he is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 It is necessary for you to maintain the final protection during the operation so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes softened after a few days and something from the hairs falls into the eye, then apply the medicine again to that place where the eyelid is becoming soft itself, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him until he is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that human eyes differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore, let your attention be on this: and the way of rightness for that which is devoted to this art should not be hidden.

Caput XIX.	 Head XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When treating fistula, if the treatment as said in the classifications of diseases does not help: then it is necessary to cauterize it using this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Command the sick person to place his head in your armpit, and hold his head with a servant between his hands so that it is not moved or shaken along with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place a cotton swab soaked in eye ointment or psyllium mucilage on his eye, and then apply the cautery iron of this shape (as shown below).
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 It is concave, like the form of a bird's feather quill at one end, with which you make a cautery iron: and if you want it to penetrate to the other end, or if you want it to point upwards in this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, it is better for your use that the concave part be towards the work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and drain pus from it, and excise it; and if it is not open, then open it and drain its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place the cautery iron on it, which has been heated very strongly.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand near the cautery iron from the eye to the nose so that your hand does not wander or the sick person moves; and you will place the cautery iron on the eyelid fat and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If, therefore, you reach the beginning of your cautery to the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then apply the cautery iron once or twice as needed; and let it go for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place cotton with butter on it, and treat it with an ointment of antiseptic, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If they exceed forty days and are not cured: then place sharp corrosive medicine upon it until the bone is exposed; and shave it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And another method of cautery for the fistula, which some of the first called.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Stretch to the place of the fistula and close it; then put in its fissure a thin cannula, that is, a thin tube, whose form is as follows.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 Pour over it an amount of drachmas of melted lead, and hold your hand with good retention on the cannula, so that the weak one does not move at all, lest the melted lead reaches or comes to his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And it is necessary for you to place over the weak one's eye a warm infusion of eggs in milk, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it with wonderful healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is cured along with what we said from cautery, and with healing, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if not, then it is necessary to make a nasal opening and bring the fistula back to the course of the nose, according to what comes in its own place.

When you treat these fissures, with what I said in the division of diseases, and healing does not help, then make a small cautery iron in this shape.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let its hollow be according to the fineness of a knife's edge.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place it quickly into those cracks, until the cautery reaches the depth of the cracks.

Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When an abscess occurs at the root of a tooth, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes old, and the pus runs and forms a fistula: then care for it, and do not apply treatment to it, then if necessary heat cautery according to its quantity, which can be inserted into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert the heated iron into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the hot iron reaches its depth and its end: do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then care for it afterwards, with what we said about treatment, until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If therefore the pus separates and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the rotten bone according to what comes out at its head.

Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then heat the cautery, whose shape will come later, so that you place the cannula on a tooth: and insert into it the heated cautery hastily: and hold your hand for a while until the sick person feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And remove your hand: then repeat the cautery as often as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then let the sick person fill his mouth with water and salt, and hold it for an hour: and rinse himself.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 Method of Cauterizing Tooth Pain.
Caput XXIII.	 De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium,
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When tooth pain is due to coldness or there is coldness within the tooth, or worms, and treatment with medicines does not help: then the Cautery is applied in two ways: either Cautery with butter; or Cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The Cautery with butter is as follows: take butter and boil it in an iron cauldron or copper.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then receive the bandage and roll it over the end of the wound.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse it in melted butter and place it quickly on the painful tooth, hold it until it cools; then repeat this process several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you wish, immerse wool or a bandage in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth; then place heated iron over it until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth's hollow.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The cauterization with fire is as follows: stretch out the probe made of brass or iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 Let there be something thick in his body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the weak bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then apply the cauterization tool with fire, whose shape will come; place it on that tooth and hold your hand until the tool cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Repeat this process several times, as pain will disappear, either on the same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 It is necessary to fill the weak bone with good butter during the application of the cauterization and hold it for an hour; then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 And this is the form of the cauterization.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Cauterize with whichever end you wish, according to what is possible; and this is the shape of the probe.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in abscesses.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIII:
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When the boil is from phlegm and cold moistures and not obedient to digestion by medicines and desires digestion quickly: then to the hollow concave Cautery, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open extremities, so that the smoke may exit from the Cautery at one of the extremes: and place it (the cautery) heated upon the boil once, and again if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the boil.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the boil is small: then place the Cautery according to the size of the boil.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a heated plaster soaked in butter, until what the fire has burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Then care for it with tooth ointment until the form of the canal heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 § Method of cauterizing in throat hoarseness and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When moistures prevail over the canal of the lung, and especially when it is accompanied by coldness of the temperament, then the ill person should first be evacuated with soluble medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then cauterize it (the affected area) in the neck at the root of the throat in a depressed location: and beware not to reach the throat with the Cautery nor the skin, unless something of its (the Cautery's) effect is needed.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then cauterize it (the affected area) with another Cautery at the junction of the neck and shoulder blade in the last part of its end: and let the Cautery be like a nail according to the method described earlier.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what was mentioned before until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 § Method of cauterizing in diseases of the lung and cough.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 When there is coughing and sickness of the lungs due to cold humors, and the person is not feverish, nor does he have consumption, and the sickness is old: then cauterize it with two cauteries above the clavicle in depressed, smooth, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 With another cautery in the middle of the chest between two nipples: and let the cautery be cylindrical in shape, as was previously described.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if your treatment is to puncture with a cautery named the Punctum, whose shape was previously described in the treatment of ear pain: and let there be punctures from thirty punctures up to another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what was described before until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And now let the cautery have three branches in this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Because cauterization is applied with it, when you do it with one of three cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in Titillico, in the dislocation of the arm.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the head is dislocated due to help [positioning], and it does not heal within an hour of returning from its dislocation, until that has become accustomed to return, then it should be dislocated slightly, which happens as we have already testified, at this point it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the patient lies on his back or on a healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then the skin is peeled, which is on the inside of the Titillico towards the top with your left hand fingers: and if the joint is dislocated towards the inside.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then fire is placed in a cautery having two hollows.
Cuius forma est haec.	 Its shape is as follows:
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes the cauterization is with a cautery having three prongs, therefore the figure of the cauterization will be that of six cauteries: and these prongs are according to the subtlety of the tendon tested.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes an additional one is added to this method, therefore there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then place on the cautery compressed leeks with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then make the sick person be still for peace so that a limb is not moved at any time until it recovers.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 And if the dislocation is upward (and this seldom happens), then cauterize it with a curved cautery on the shoulder, or with many pointed cauteries.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 For joining it becomes strong and moisture is removed; the sick person recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII (the twenty-eighth chapter).
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When cold and many humidities occur in the stomach, until it separates itself from its composition and produces many catarrhs for it, and continuous methods of treatment do not help; then the sick person should lie on his back, extend his legs, and stretch out his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery of the size of one finger under the concavity of the chest and a curved cautery on the shoulder, and two cauteries below the sides of one cautery, until a triangular figure of the cauteries appears.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And extend them apart so that they do not join together, when they produce pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And the depth of the cautery is the size of two thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 And let the figure of cauteries be in this shape without addition. And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: and let the cautery that is made for this purpose be one in the shape of a circle according to this shape.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 The stomach is to be cauterized by touching it with this cautery that frightens it. Let there be marks on the stomach at the point where you wish to apply encaustum. Then cauterize that point with the pointed cautery. Then care for it with the remedy that preceded until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 On the mode of cauterizing the epigastric region (frigidum).
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When there occurs in the epigastric region (Epate) pain due to coldness and moistness, or due to excessive gas, until it exits from its natural expulsion of superfluous matter and the patient is cured with what has been said, and it does not improve in this: then it is necessary that the patient lies down on his neck, and marks with encaustum three cauteries in this shape, and the same amount below the hypocondria, where a man's elbow reaches; and let the space between each cautery be of the size of a finger; and let the cautery be of the length of the body straight; and do not press your hand tightly with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the thickness of that which is burned be according to the thickness of the skin, without any addition; and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If he is not standing, then let him lie down who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the shape of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 It is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a pointed cautery when subtlety and wisdom are present in your art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 "Take care not to proceed too far in cauterization, lest the entire thickness of the skin be burnt, for the body as a whole is burnt, and it reaches the intestines; since there the skin is delicate, therefore you know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 "On the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 "When it happens that an abscess is about to burst and one wishes to know whether it is within the flesh of the liver or its membrane; if it is within the flesh of the liver, there is a dull pain without sharpness, and if it is in the membrane of the liver, with a very acute pain: and you see that the treatment has become tiring.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 "Therefore the patient should lean forward on his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 "Then mark the position of the abscess with a hot iron, and then heat an iron similar to a probe.
Et haec est forma eius.	 "This is its shape (the probe).
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 "And cauterize with the probe until the entire skin is burnt and it reaches the pus, until all the pus comes out; then treat him with care for bursting abscesses, until he is cured.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 "And one should not use this method of cauterization, unless one's study extends to the art of medicine; and through whose hands these diseases often recur with experience: then he may dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 "But it is better to let it be (the abscess), in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 "Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 "The ancients said that a probe with the roots of Aristolochia should be used for cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 "And it is to take a dry and long root of Aristolochia, one longer root which can be found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse her in oil and burn it in fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize it with a single cautery where the neck meets the shoulder, and with two small cauteries on the areas slightly below the chin, in that region under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two more cauteries on the area between the fifth and sixth ribs towards the back, and another cautery in the center of the chest, and another one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three more cauteries from the back: one where it is between the two scapulas, and two more on both sides of the chest, with the lower cautery where it is between the two scapulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And you should not press your hand with the cautery, rather let it smell of skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some ancient men have said that there are those who use a cautery made of iron resembling a rod and burn it inside the chest until it reaches the same place as the boil, and the pus comes out, just as we said in the case of an abscess in Epates.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with the cautery, there is a fear that either the sick person will die immediately or a fistula will occur in a place where healing cannot be achieved.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32: The method of cauterizing the spleen.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the illness of the spleen, as we said in the treatment of diseases and your treatment does not work, then cauterization is to be done in this case in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One is to make three or four cauteries in a row along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauterizations described earlier [in the book].
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let every cautery's size be that of a finger's thickness, more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 The method of cauterizing the liver, as we mentioned earlier, should be equal on both sides.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery: let it be weak and prone onto its backside.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method of cauterizing is: having heated the cautery with two openings, as we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and peel the skin, which is directly above the spleen, where the weak arm arrives; let your peeling be along the body's width, so that the cauteries fall along the body's length.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then introduce two openings heated very strongly, until they penetrate the skin from one side; then remove the cautery; thus there will be four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize with a cautery having three openings.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then care for the cautery after you have released it, let it emit pus for many days; for this is more conducive than the other treatments that preceded it in healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Hydropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 A cautery does not fall in Hydropsy, unless it is properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat a Hydropsy with the methods of treatment we mentioned earlier, and it does not improve, then you must cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, two behind the loins, and one on the chest and another on the stomach; let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then release the open cautery, so that it emits pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And it is not right to evacuate the sick from treatment after cautery, for it is necessary that two intentions are gathered towards him: and healing will hasten towards him with divine aid.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cautery for the abdomen should be clavilis; according to its preceding form. And the form of the cautery for the back should be oliuaris; according to its preceding form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When they are amputated in Hydropico and filled with citrine water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot at the navicular bone, which is between auricular and annular; then remove your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it. Then remove your hand. Do not go back to it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 For citrine water will flow out, and let the cautery be in this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be at the end of a cultellar cautery throughout the entire leg; and let the cautery be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower than that, about half the length of the leg. And over the whole hip two cauteries; and leave the open cautery without treatment for a long time: until some water flows out of it; then cure it with what we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing for the solution of the abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the solution of the belly becomes loose due to cold and moistness, until it weakens the powers retained and digestive, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with methods of treatment, but it does not heal: and you see a person enduring an excessive force of heat, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his own stomach, according to what has preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle claw-shaped cautery: and a cautery over alum on top of blisters large or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 If you see excessive moisture and a person enduring it, then cauterize him with a cautery on his chest (pecten) and on the whole hip: and perhaps you may add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 For indeed, this treatment is progressing, of which the benefit does not wander off.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are made of thick fluids, cold or corrupt moistures, and they are treated with what we have said before, but treatment does not improve: then cauterize them with three cauteries on the lower part of the loin under the flank slightly triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel as if two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that his stomach is cold and food is not digested, and you see his face becoming pale: then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and with a cautery on his liver (Epar), and another one on his spleen (Splenem), with a cautery claw-shaped (clauili): and leave the open cautery for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 On the method of cauterizing the althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	 Head XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you excise althelul (a type of tumor or growth), then apply a burning cautery similar to a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then introduce the burning (cautery) into the excised althelul; and withdraw your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are many althelul (tumors or growths), then cauterize each one with a separate cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them, applying to them the remedy that is used for them until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on alcatin (a type of stone), this is more beneficial for the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Head XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the sick person does not obey the incision and operation as we have described in its place, and is afraid of it, perhaps he will heal with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 If a fistula occurs and discharges pus and becomes corrupt, cure it.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 It is necessary to test it as it should be, with a probe of subtle material.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then find out the depth of it by means of a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat the cautery which is like a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then insert yourself heated (into) that fistula and find out the depth to which the probe has penetrated.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 Then repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all the corrupt bodies are burnt up, once, twice, or thrice, according to the necessity of your case.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And be careful not to burn the nerve or the large vein (if it is there); or if the fistula opens up to the bladder or the intestine, then be careful of these places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not make that (action), unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place; and consider that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for the place until it has healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If, however, the place is sealed and the materials are cut off from it and remain for a long time; then you will know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 If the materials do not fall off from it, then you will know that it is penetrating, or that a rotten bone is at a deeper part of it, or something like that; whose memory will come back to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX (39).
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from thick wind, and it is weakened by this disease of the body, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the flank on both kidneys, with a cautery over the entire kidney with a cautery claw, whose precedent has been remembered.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we cauterize it again in the same flank.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Therefore, three white lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Thus, there will be more relief in the latter (stage).
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, so that it does not hold urine properly, then cauterize it in the lower part of the abdomen below the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, with a cautery on one side from the right side of the abdomen and another on the left side: let the length of this cauterization be according to the size of the knuckle of the thumb: and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or two cauteries if necessary: and let the preceding cautery be as that of the claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When coldness and moistness occur in the Matrix (womb), and it is forbidden for conception because of this, and its menstrua are corrupted, and the summoning of them is delayed, and there is pain at their approach, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery below on the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be a claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 The Method of Cauterizing the Womb in Dislocation.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When the mucous humors flow out to the perineum of the womb and become the cause of its displacement from its place; and the sign of this is that one leg is extended over the other when they are brought together: and a gap or void is found in the place of dislocation.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the weak spot above the perineum of the womb with a similar cautery in a circle; after you have marked the circumference of the perineum with hot iron, as is customary: and that the perineum falls into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the cautery be of the same form as the one used in cauterizing the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large lard-caustery; and the depth of the cautery should be in proportion to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 The Method of Cauterizing for Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the ankle joint, and its cause is coldness and moistness: and the sick one is treated as mentioned before, but it does not improve, then that should be allowed to heal by itself: then it is necessary that you dissolve the sick person from thick humors with foul pills or artificial pills, and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cauterization is according to two modes: either cauterization with medicines applied, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 Cauterization with fire, is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of these modes is that you cauterize over the ankle joint with three triangular cauteries in this manner.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make their depth good or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And let the space between each cautery be of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be covered with oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes however, a cauterization takes place in the middle of the ankle joint itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 And if you wish to cauterize with a ring, whose shape preceded in the ankle joint dislocation, one: so that the ring encompasses the entire ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And burn off the thickness of the skin entirely.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain is attached to the ankle itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, at the place where the sick one indicates, in which there is pain, and your cautery four fingers on the outer part of the shin: and let the cautery be a knife-shaped one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the sick person indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a cautery, with one, two, or four, or more, if necessary.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 If he indicates that the pain is turned towards the leg below the knee, then cauterize it there with a one-edged cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And be careful in every cauterization of yours, that you do not burn the nerve or the great artery, and attract harm to it through this, or contracture.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And I myself have seen one and another, from those who cauterized above the ankle, and burned too much in the cauterization, and the leg became swollen until the tumor reached the foot, and it was perforated completely, and the whole foot was corrupted: then the abdomen burst open, and death followed this.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And some wise men said in cauterizing the ankle, that this is the method of the cautery.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a small crucible of iron, whose diameter is half the size of the palm: and it should be at its mouth according to the thickness of the nut of a thumb or less: and inside this small crucible there should be a third small crucible.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let the space that is between every crucible be as much as the size of a knuckle: and let the crucibles be open from two sides: and let their height be like a knuckle, or two knuckles: and make handles for them from iron appropriately placed in the crucibles.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it is heated in the fire until it turns red and throws sparks: then it should be placed on a potsherd of the ankle, with the sick person lying down on his healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Cauterize it therefore with three round cauteries at one time.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then let him go for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterwards pack it with butter and let the open wound heal for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Albucasis says, we have not used this kind of cautery enough, because of the horror of its appearance; and therefore, because few are found who can bear to look upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Nevertheless, it is one of the good cauterizations for him who can endure it and finds a place for it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 The cautery with medicines driving it is, you shall make two small bags containing a perforated armillary, from which descends the key of its door made of bronze or iron, as long as the height of the wall; and on the height of these there should be two knots, or as if they themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And the space that is between the two should be of the thickness of a finger and they should be open from below and above; and it should hold each other according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it on a box with an anchor lying upon the sick side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand much upon the box with the anchor.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour water between the two circles which has been heated a little by fire and hold it as much as an hour's time; and let the sick bear the biting of it and its burning, for he himself finds the biting like that of fire, until the biting ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then wash your hand with the tool and clean the anchor completely with warm water and sweet water; then let it go for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place butter upon it until the blackness of burning is removed; and let it go for some days, and pus will run out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 The remedy is at last in aid.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a cure with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain spreads to the hip or leg: make a splint for him in such a way that it contains water, as you did in the case of the broken bone equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is the method of hot water: I have already written about it in the treatise on rectifying remedies.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take two parts of lime and unburnt plaster, grind each separately; put them in a new pot whose lower part is pierced with a small hole, according to the amount that will be added to the radius; place another earthenware pot underneath; pour over it lime and plaster from sweet water, so that both are submerged by about a finger; press them down with your hand; let go of the pot, until the sharp water goes down to the bottom of the earthenware pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then gather that water entirely, and pour it over another mortar; and grind, until it returns.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For that very reason it will then be strong and highly sharp, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it makes the action of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medicines, with which they are cauterized (or burnt), such as tartar emetic, also strychnine, and almond oil with soap, in such a way that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And indeed, Galen relates the story of a certain man from the ancient times, who was cured of the pain in the anus and the sciatic vein; and he greatly praised his cure.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that it did not require any other treatment, and that he was cured from the pain in one application, until he reported that perhaps he himself entered the bath, and came out already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be taken from green seitarag; and if green seitarag is not found, dry one should be taken, recently; and it should be ground very much with a little fat, and placed over the anus, where there is pain, or thigh, or hip; and it should be tied, and allowed to stay for three hours, or until the sick person feels the relaxation of the burning sensation.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes hot, introduce it onto a bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For the pain subsides, and he is cured.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use a cautery with these medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides himself said that the feces of goats, when with it the sciatic vein is cauterized, should be added to it; and a cautery is made according to this method.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take flax (or linen), immerse it in old oil, and place it over the deep place which is between the big toe of the foot and the sole, and is closer to the sole.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dried goat droppings, heat it over fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Place it on the flax and let it burn out (completely).
Deinde itera illud.	 Then do this again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not cease to do that until sensation arrives through the mediation up to the ankle, and the pain stops.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cauterization is called Vaccinum cauterization (or branding).
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 Chapter on cauterization for back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Whenever there is back pain due to various causes such as fall, blow, excessive evacuation, and similar conditions, due to the infiltration of cold and moist matter; cauterization only applies in this specific case, which is done by the infiltration of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after evacuation (bowel movement) of the sick person with foul-smelling pills and similar things, three lines should be drawn on the back where there is pain, following the width of the palm; after marking each line with encaustic in five cauterizations or more depending on the quantity that comes from the strength of the patient; and make cauterization by cauterization puncture.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizations along with the medial claw shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for humpback (kyphosis).
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This illness often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of its beginning in children is that it happens above them with a constriction during inspiration at elevation, and you find it at the bottom of the spine of the back and the nodes of this part, which has already begun to appear over the other spines.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see it and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is in the shape of a circle.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 The cautery should catch the entire spine part equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the spine with a pointed cautery, do two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for the place until it heals as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And beware not to administer the cautery on a hump that is formed from a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 Chapter on Cauterization in Gout and Joint Pain.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains of joints are caused by cold wetness that is poured out to any part of the body, then when pain occurs in the feet, according to medical custom, it should be called gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 When gout caused by cold is being treated with methods of treatment and the pains do not subside, then cauterization removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is that you should cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the foot, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be Olive Oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you need to puncture the sole of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and it often happens this way, then cauterize it over all the knee with three or four cauteries from every side, with the same cautery of Claw.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If more than one are necessary for you with this cautery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 Do not immerse your hand in the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pains rise to the knees and back, then administer what was said about cautery in its own chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If the pains are only in the hands, then pierce around the circumference of the nails, as two lines are rolled up.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If pain remains in the fingers, then pierce them all, over every knuckle and over the back of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If pains rise after days to elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not evacuate the weak from good management, from receiving medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if there is good management and phlegm is evacuated, it will be cured with the help of God with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When there is a rupture in the groins and the intestine or yarn goes down to the testicle, and it is close by: then one must order that the weak person should abstain from food on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And let him use laxatives so that stool comes out of his stomach.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath until the yarn comes out or the intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then bring him back with your fingers, and mark with a hot iron under the rupture on the back of the hand with a sign whose end is similar to half a circle above the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then heat the iron cautery in this form until it becomes white and throw small pieces of charcoal onto it.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then reduce the intestine, or the hernia to its hollow.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then place the attendant's hand over the location so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the limbs of the sick person, and placed a retractor under it, and another serving on his limbs, and another on his chest who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery over that mark, with your hand holding the cautery upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold it until you follow the bone with it; or repeat with another tool if you are not able to follow it to the bone in the first instance.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And be careful to observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it and bring harm upon the sick person or great misfortune occur.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not follow the bone with the cautery, the operation is of no benefit.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it is necessary that the cautery for children be delicate, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care with the remaining ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 And let the sick person lie on his back for forty days until the wound is healed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 And it is necessary to give him nourishment for the duration of his treatment, which will soften his stomach, lest the intestine come out during attempts and evacuations.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a well-made ligament and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And he should be diminished in labor, and in food and drink intake, and in violent speech.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when he is subjected to this regime, he will heal completely.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I shall speak of the treatment for hernias with incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 When hernias occur in the remaining abdomen, and they are beginning and wish to be stopped, then cauterize the hernia with a round cautery according to its size; and let that which is burned be as the third part of it from then on.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then take care of yourself, as I have said, and do not add to it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And some first ones said: that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautionery, in this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is signed with hot iron, and a line is placed that runs through the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line towards below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with a nail-like cautionery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautionery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing for pain due to rupture or trauma.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When pain occurs in some limbs due to rupture or trauma and the pain persists for a long time and there is no cure with medicine, then it is necessary to be cauterized with a cautionery of puncture point.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And the cautionery of all members should be according to its size and its smallness, and its weakness, and its power, and the location of torsion, and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If he is cured by the first cautionery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then apply another cautionery on top of it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because by the custom of these pains they are changed from one member to another that is closer to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore you should follow them with cautionery until the weak one is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing for leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 The leprous, however, are sometimes helped by great cautionery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And especially the species of leprosy that comes from rottenness of phlegm and melancholy: when it is considered to cauterize it itself.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If leprosy is beginning and it has been treated with what was said in the division, and it does not decrease nor stop: and fear that corruption will spread over the entire complexion of it: then cauterize him on top of his head with five cautioneries: one in the middle of the head known, and the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, and two above the two horns, and one behind the nuchal bone.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 Place your thumb lightly on the cautery until it makes a small impression on the bone, and the cortex should dislocate: to relieve the expiration of large vapors from it, and cauterize also over the spleen as previously described.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 If however, the leprosy has already spread over the sick person and is clearly visible: then it is necessary to cauterize with those cauteries that were mentioned earlier in the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on both cheekbones, and with two cauteries on both shoulder blades, and six on the hip bones, and one large one over alhahosos near the tail and one on it, in the same almeidati: and with two on the ankles: namely, on each ankle with one, and with two on the thighs, and two on the upper arms, and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the chest, and cauterize it over all the joints of his fingers of both hands and feet, and cauterize over every calcaneum of his feet, and burn the palms of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 Be careful with the nerves that are above the last calcaneus to avoid burning them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes the cautery is applied on the forehead, and another on the stomach, and another on the ebar.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And know that, the more you apply the cautery, the greater the benefit and the stronger it becomes.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And know that, the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery as healthy people do; this is because his body has already become numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 It is necessary that the cauteries be of different sizes and shapes according to the members and joints; this is based on the types of iron instruments as previously described.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then, prepare a cautery from wheat flour and honey, and for the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 Method of Cauterization in Sleep.
Caput L.	 Head of Leon [Albucasis].
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a part of the body is numbed (stupet) and treated with medicines, oils, plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the affected part using cauteries, according to the size of the member or its diminished state.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 And when cauterization is performed for certain numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, in the spine at the nerve exit point moving that limb; and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not presume to perform it (cauterization) on that unless the one who knows about the structure of the body and the course of nerves moving the body is wise.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 Chapter on Cauterization in Albaraz.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LXI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When Albaraz (a type of wound?) becomes old and does not receive anything from the arts of medicine; then cauterize it with a deep cautery slightly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the white disappears and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with wheat flour and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa (a type of fern), and blood of a dove and of a heron; each part should be equal; mix all these together, spread them on a cloth, and let them adhere to the location until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 Chapter on Cauterization for Cancer.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LXII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautionery around its circumference, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 The wise say that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 I, however, do not find that to be so: because I fear that it will burn, and I have already seen that happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 It is truer, however, to cauterize it around its circumference with a circle, as we have said; or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 Chapter LIII: When someone has Adubelati that is slow to mature, either because of excessive production or due to weakness from old age and scant blood supply, or because one wishes to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize it around its circumference with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let it be.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For it will hasten when matured.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If you wish to perforate it with cautionery, then ignite the cautionery, whose form is as follows:
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 Place it [the instrument] in the middle of Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery that follows be weakened, so that its course may be purified.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Chapter on the mode of cauterizing in a corrosive disease.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV [The forty-fourth chapter].
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 A corrosion is not anything except corruption walking in a limb and consuming it, just as fire eats dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If therefore you see a corrosion in a place that can bear a cautery with fire, then apply much cautery, small and large nails, according to what suits the place where the corrosion is located.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate the entire corruption and nothing remains of it deep within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then let it be for three days and place finely ground sulfur with oil on the cauterized places until all scabs and all corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then care for it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If therefore you see that after three days flesh is born in a healthy way, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery on what remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 A corrosion is sometimes treated with an acidic medication.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 The corrosion itself arises where the cautery was.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, a cautery with fire is more effective; and I myself have said that the cauterization of it with an acidic medication is used in division; so take it whenever you need it there.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Chapter on the mode of cauterizing in nails and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV [The forty-fifth chapter].
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the feet and it is a thick, filtered matter that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 The cautery is indeed of two kinds: the cautery with fire, and the cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the type with fire, it should be made similar to a bird's talon in shape: which is to be made of iron, according to its size that contains a nail from all sides; and it should be fine at the edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the heated [tool] on the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail; and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply ointment with forest herbs, crushed with salt; and leave the ointment on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 It will be rooted out by its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with a gentle ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they are not converted and occur frequently on the surface of the body, particularly in hands and feet: then administer cauterization with hot water; and it is to be had that you take a cannula made of copper, iron or bird's feather; and place it on the nail, or althea.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula; hold your hand and turn it with pressure for a short time, so that the tip of the cannula is pressed onto the root of the nail, and let the hot water find its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and wait briefly for the weak one over the bite of the hot water for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then leave it, for the nail will be rooted out with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Thus do this one after another, until you come to all who are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then care for them when they have been rooted out, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 Method of Cauterization During a Shake/Tremor.
Caput LVI.	 Healings for wounds of the head which are incurable by
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 If a tremor occurs from cold in the nerve or from quartan fever or another cause, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the dorsal vertebrae, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and in its chest with a cautery, and over its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The tremor is quieted when the cautery is applied to oil, and health from cold illness hastens.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 Method of Cauterization of Albathir.
Caput LVII.	 Si accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in ner
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes the foul Albathir are expelled from the body, that is, pustules which are made from corrupted gross matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize over every head of the pustule with a subtle cautery and myrtle wood whose tip is burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of the long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized with a small piece of raw meat, at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method; and they are not increased; and superfluity is broken causing them to be expelled, and they heal from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it must be done after the evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 Method of Cauterization for Bleeding from an Artery in a Wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Si in ulnere alicui accidit fluxus sanguinis
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Often bleeding from an artery occurs which is cut near the wound, which happens externally, or at the incision of the abscess, or at the cauterization of a limb, and similar to them; and it is difficult to separate it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 When therefore it happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it; and bind it tightly, until the blood is held under your finger, and nothing escapes from there.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place a small oil lamp cautery on fire, and many in number; and blow upon them until they are very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one, either small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery upon the vein after you remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If it is expelled when you remove your finger from the opening of the artery, and extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore do not cease to do that with one after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And be careful, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and other harm befall the weak patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it; especially since the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is drawn out, its extremities contract and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it is tied with a strong thread ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or medicines are placed upon it of the kind that are for cutting off blood, and it is bound with a tight tourniquet.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 He who administers the amputation with a ligament and tourniquet, or with things burning, and similar ones, does not help him completely, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If it happens to someone and the physician is not present nor medicine: then let him begin with the positioning of the index finger over the opening of the vein as we have mentioned, and tightly constricting it until the blood is besieged from above the wound, and upon the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And the finger should not be removed, above it with cold water of intense coldness always, until the blood freezes, swells, and is severed.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile he should consider in him what is needed from a cautery, or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 Chapter on Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 We have already said in Chapter One that every ailment in which fire cautery and burning medicine are appropriate, and its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cautery.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And there I placed chapters from the head to the feet.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I will proceed in this chapter on the same path: so that what is sought may be relieved for the one seeking it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, sons, you should learn what is there in this chapter due to the fear of what was in Chapter One on cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And because of that, there should be greater caution in it, since in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation often falls with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision on an abscess, or the exit of pus, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision on a stone, and similar things: from all of these things is associated tremor, fear, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you, let it not fall upon you that which has hesitation, for sometimes such things in this art fall upon men as the ways of their weaknesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there is one who gets angry with his sickness, and death is easy for him; because of the vehemence he finds from his weakness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when sickness comes from fear, it indicates death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And there is one who gives you potions, and promises health, but his sickness is deadly.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore it is not appropriate for you to agree to him who comes to you from those whose ways are such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 Let your caution be greater than greed and greediness.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume about anything from it unless after certain knowledge, which confirms among you a praiseworthy outcome for what it has reached.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And use in the cure of all your sick ones, prediction and indication about it regarding which suit health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For in that is assistance to you for the acquisition of fame, glory, memory, and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 God will inspire you, His children, with knowledge; do not let Him take away from you direction and inspiration; for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this chapter by dividing it into sections according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet; so that you may be relieved of what is sought from it, and what is needed.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 Chapter: On the treatment of water accumulating in children's heads.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this illness frequently occurs in children during childbirth, or when the midwife squeezes the child's head without due care.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And sometimes it also happens for reasons hidden and unknown to us.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And indeed I have never seen this illness in anyone other than children, and death has come swiftly to every one of them whom I saw; for that reason it seemed to me advisable to abandon the operation.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And I myself have seen a child whose head was full of water and whose head swelled every day until it could no longer sit up on its own due to the size of its head; furthermore, the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 This swelling, indeed, either occurs between skin and bone, or it occurs beneath the bone at the forehead.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation in this case, if there is swelling between skin and bone and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head, extending as far as two finger-widths; the length of the incision should be such that the moisture can drain away.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of the spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If, however, the swelling has increased more, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions according to this shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 If the swelling is beneath the bone and there are signs that the skull is separated from all sides and water collects when you press it with your hand, and this cannot be hidden from you; then make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after making the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then tie up the incisions with strips of cloth and wool.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then apply it with wine and oil for five days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then untie the bandage, and care for the wound with plasters and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And thou shalt not omit to tie head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 Feed the sick man with all dry food of scant moisture until his limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of incision is to consider where it appears the abscess's size is, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Since sometimes it is more so in the back part or forehead, right or left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore climb with the incision where it appears to you that there is an abscess and filling of water, and cut through it as much as possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe that you do not cut an artery, and there be a flow of blood, and the sick person dies from the flow with evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 [Section Title: Incision of Arteries After Ears]
Caput II.	 [Chapter 2.]
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When catarrhs happen to someone for the eyes or chest and it has not been treated with remedies, then more so is the last treatment in that, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when you wish to cut them, let the sick person shave his head first.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then scrape the place with rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the sick person tie his neck with any cloth he has.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And the places of each are located behind the ears and depressed, and they rarely hide themselves unless in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark with pitch both, and cut one on each side with a scalpel, the incision reaching to the bone, and make it broad enough to match the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, insert a scalpel under the artery and cut it upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 When a vein is cut, blood gushes out with pulsating flow, which jumps into the interior with frequent leap.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 But if the artery is not apparent to the senses, then it is necessary that measurements be made from the ear three fingerbreadths in space.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with wax and bind up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And that which is necessary to draw from blood is VI ounces, and perhaps you will draw more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 Cut the whole thing according to its size that appears to you from the strength of the weak and the filling of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then look at the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 If anything remains at the bone from the flesh, then cut it off, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind up the wound with linen strips.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 Chapter on the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemicrania or acute catarrh occurs due to acid moistures and heat in the temples, or an old scald, violent and similar to these; and it is treated with methods of treatment for illness, but it does not help: then we have experience in dealing with such illnesses by extracting arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have said.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of operation for extracting them is to shave the sick person's hair in the temples and stretch out the skin over the appearing artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 Itself is shown to you by its pulse and is rarely hidden except in a few men or due to violent cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden from you, then the sick person should bind his head with any cloth of his own; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 If an abscess is present, let it be opened with hot water until a clear appearance appears to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the lancet which I previously prepared.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then thrust a hook into it and extract it upward until you extract it from the skin, and let it come out from all sides through the layers beneath it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If, however, the artery is delicate: then roll it up with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then make an incision in that place according to its size, where the ends extend and contract, and avoid bleeding.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not incised, and if it is not separated, blood will not rise up deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then let six ounces of blood out, until the third [point].
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: then it should be tied in two places with strong double thread or silk, or with cords of alum, so that putrefaction does not approach it before the wound is consolidated, and bleeding does not occur.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then make an incision in the excess that is between two bindings.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this at that hour, or another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the bone, with a knife-shaped cautery, until the ends of it are cut, and it remains in place for this same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And this is better work, unless if one has a fever, or weakened by heat treatment.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because the cautery is from those things that help to end moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is better as a remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the extraction of arteries, it should be filled with cooked old linen, and powdered fly-ash should be placed on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after solution (of a wound), it is to be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with linen until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If during the operation, bleeding occurs from an artery, then hurry to cut it with a cauterizing iron, or fill the place with wax: and tighten your hand until the blood stops flowing.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If there is nothing present (to use), then place your finger on the location until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And cover the location with water of intense coldness until the sharpness subsides, and tie it as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And because the artery that is lighter and easier to extract is to be cauterized with this iron having two blades: and let the sharpness of the two blades be similar to a razor's edge.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are as sharp as two knives, coldness is required for both of them: and they do not cut flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Since therefore they have a certain thickness, heat is required within them, and the flesh is cut quickly: when this work needs to be done, it is better than any other operation, and easier, and more convenient.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And the space between the two blades should be of the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with hot iron: and place both very hot ones, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its ends can be removed.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 Because this iron does not harden completely.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the shape of the iron.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 Chapter on the care of chronic and recurring tear ducts from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When tears are persistent and flow from the veins on the exterior of the skull of the head: and no treatment medicine is applied to them with medicines, and the face of the sick person turns red, and one feels a walking sensation in the forehead, as with the movement of ants: and the eyes are weakened, moist, so that the hairs have already corroded with corruption: and the eyelids are heated from the acuteness of tears: then the ancients resorted to this treatment for them, and they named it the cure, with a knife.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And it is, to instruct the sick one to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three cuts in the forehead, each one equal in length to the forehead: and the length of the cut should be about two fingers, and the first one should be at the middle of the forehead, and the second one slightly lower towards the movement of the arms, and the third on the other side: and avoid cutting the arteries that are on the two sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all the cuts be the length of three connected fingers: and have a piece of prepared sponge or dried cloth with you, which you can use to absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert into it two pointed ends of a splint whose following shape is as follows:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the incision on the side of the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape off with it all the skin that is between the two cuts, which is above the eye.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do the same from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove the splint and insert into the first incision another tool called a sharp scalpel, with one edge blunt, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place the sharp side towards the skin attached flesh and the blunt side towards the bone; and push it so that it reaches the mid-fissure; and cut along with it all vessels descending from the head to the eyes, except for the incision which should be continued until that which appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then make it in the mid-fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when an equal amount of blood flows out, squeeze the places from the clotted blood vessels.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place linen cloth from old cooking on all the fissures and put above them boiled chickpeas soaked in wine, oil or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And ensure that no hot abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day, dissolve the ligament and administer a large amount of infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointment of Basilicon and others that heal wounds until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 Chapter on the treatment of sharp tears and catarrh in the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone experiences sharp and frequent catarrh or tears, the eyes appear weakened, small, and their sight is already impaired; the eyelids are ulcerated, hairs fall out and there is a strong pain deep in the head that causes sneezing: then take from these symptoms those materials and catarrh which do not come unless from multiple veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 A better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And you shall order a sick person to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly off-center to the side by a certain width, starting from the left temple and ending at the right temple; and let the incision go as deep as the bone; and move your hand away from the temples that move during chewing until when the bone is exposed; then dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate with a scalpel or scissors from the two lips of the incision, made previously with a hot iron or with linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then tie it on top with thread; and soak the thread in wine and oil to prevent a hot abscess from forming.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you release it and see that a hot abscess is starting to decrease, then it is necessary to break the bone, until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then treat the wound with a drying agent that promotes tissue growth; as if you were taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of pitch, prepare an ointment from it and apply it to these wounds to promote tissue growth.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 Chapter on treating a wound that affects the ear.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Every case that affects the ear falls into four categories: a mineral stone, similar to a stone such as iron and glass; or from plants like chickpeas and beans; or liquid such as water, vinegar, and similar substances; or of animal origin.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When a stone falls into the ear, or one of its kind that does not grow within the ear and cannot be added, expose only the ear; if you see a stone, then pour some oil or sesame into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction, and make it sneeze with powdered mixture, and apply oil in both nostrils at the onset of sneezing; when you place ear fragments in cotton or wool, stretch the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 This sentence is repeated many times [with this care].
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not come out, then administer the extraction with Gestifull (Pizzighelli's Subtle). Its shape is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 Therefore if it comes out with Gestifull, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer the extraction with a small subtle hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it still does not come out through that [method], then make a cannula from brass and insert the end of the cannula into the ear hole deeply; apply what is in the tip of the cannula with softened beeswax mixed with oil, so that the airway is only for the cannula; then draw it out with your strong suction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 This sentence is repeated many times [with what I have said].
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it still does not come out this way: then take some helkalimbat or water (prepared gluten), which birds are captured with; place a small amount of it on the end of a rod after you have centered the cotton properly placed over it; then insert it into the ear canal with ease, after you have straightened the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If it still does not come out with everything I have said, then hurry to cut [it], before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 The method of cutting [it] is, that the bloodletter first uses a lancet on the head; and draw out from him according to the bloodletting's strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the patient sit between your hands, turn the ear upward, and make a small incision at the base of the ear in the fatty area depressed there; let the incision be shaped like the moon until you reach the stone; then remove it with what is possible for you using your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then from your hour, seal and care for the fissure until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If something falling into the ear is from one kind of grains that grow and swell, then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not obey you for extraction, then take a thin, delicate spatula in this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it the removal of that kind of grain falling into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the steam of the ear, until you place many fragments on it: then remove it with uncinus or with a delicate probe or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is relieved.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In the water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the sick person to sneeze with its nose blocked at first: and already the ear has filled up with some hot water; and there lies on top of it the ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If therefore it comes out through that (ear canal), it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not: then take many small, soft stones, about the length of a finger, and heat them slightly with fire; and let the sick person introduce one from these into the ear canal of his own: and he should spit on one foot from that part, and hit with another stone the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, let him not cease to do this with stones and stones until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water comes out so that you take with a sponge or a reed one end, and insert into the ear its other end; and heat the other end with fire until it is burned as much as possible.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reed and do the same thing many times until all the water comes out; and remove it with a cannula as described above with the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In the extraction of an animal entering into it (the wound), if it is a small body such as a louse, care for it as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 If it is of a large body, which appears to the sense: then administer its extraction with tweezers and unciform instruments; and its removal is easier for all who are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you care for it with what I said in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your care does not help: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If therefore something appears from the worms (there), then extract it with tweezers or with delicate unciform instruments.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 If however nothing appears from there, then take a cannula, of which this is the shape (described as), narrow at the bottom and wide at the top; and insert its fine end into the ear according to the quantity that the weak one can tolerate; then suck it with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do this repeatedly until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 If they do not obey you to go out, then encircle them with the point of a cannula with wax, as I said in the stone (chapter).
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 If they do not come out with what I said, then administer the distillations that have already been experienced by the ancients in the elimination of worms; and you will find this in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your flow (of oil or medicine) be which you pour into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small opening, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore let the thing that pushes (in the concave part of the cannula) be made of bronze well-made.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take radish, and insert it into the affected ear with a suitable lining; then pour oil, or vinegar, or whatever medicine you prefer into the tube; and let it be in the ear; then introduce the heated radish onto the top of it, and press it gently with your hand until the oil is pushed out into the hollow part of the ear, and the sick person feels it; and what is poured into the ear should already be slightly warm; beware that nothing cold which distills into it is very strong; for medicine does not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 On the treatment of an obstruction in the Ear.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Sometimes infants are born from their mothers' unperforated ears.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it also happens that the obstruction of the ear arises from a wound or flesh born therein.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this obstruction sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which cannot be seen; and sometimes it occurs in the outer part of the ear canal, and it can be seen.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, which cannot be seen by sight, is difficult to cure in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in that which can be seen by sight, it is necessary to place the sick person's ear on the sun and look into it; then if you see an obstruction appearing, open it with a thin spatula whose shape is as follows: its end should have a small notch, whose part should be sharp; and the rest of the spatula should be soft on both sides so as not to hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If the obstruction is born from flesh within the ear, then hold it with a thin hook and cut it out with great force until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If there is an incision in the depth of the ear: then take fine copper wire, linen, and heat it slightly; then insert it into the wound of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you find an incision accompanied by illness and hearing loss, attempt its opening with ease; be careful not to wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place linen in the ear according to the size of the opening that you have closed with an Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are confident about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen, immerse it in rose water, sprinkle on it ground zinc and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear beginning to abscess: then you must remove the linen and let it drain with another piece of linen that has been soaked in a cerate made with rose oil, until the warm abscess settles; then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If there is bleeding: then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear; use the rest of the treatment that was mentioned in the section on distillations to stop the blood flow.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Chapter on Althele's treatment for eyelids.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These are the Althelil (affections) that happen in the eyelids of the eyes, which are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hold them with tweezers (or with a hook), and cut them at their roots with a spatula.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place it on the affected area crushed.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If blood flows out of them (the affections), then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 They often return when there remains something of their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 § On the treatment of tumors on the eyelids of the eyes.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often something happens in the eyelids that resembles a tumor in its strength and hardness, and it is called Grandino because of this; it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the operation in them is to examine whether it is a Grandino that is coming out of the eyelid, which appears on the eyelid and moves to all parts, and its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Therefore, make an incision across it (the tumor).
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then scrape off all parts of it with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hold it (the scraped part) with a hook and cut it.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 If its removal is not prepared for you unless after you make a small incision through the eyelid, then it harms weak people.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the incision is large: then gather it (the scraped part) with suture; and treat it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 Ointment indeed restores it, and fleshes it out.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 If the grain is turned towards the inner parts of the ear and it faces the internal surface, then turn the eyelid and hang the grain with a hook; besides, you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched by an incision, it does not harm anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then clean the eye after the incision of the grain with salt water; and care for the place with it until the weak one is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 Chapter on the treatment of the eyelids.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 The Axirnath is a pimple that is generated in the upper eyelid; it indeed mostly happens to children; and it weighs their eyes down, and cataracts occur to them in the mornings, and they are unable to see the light of the sun, for this reason, because tears flow towards them, and you can see them constantly lying on their faces, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are below the eyebrows, which have already swollen; and indeed the swelling of Axirnath is noticeable to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel it among them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation for it is that the weak one puts his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a linen cloth, and prepare a piece of it, and make a circle out of the cloth according to the size that contains the Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then put it on it and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the middle of this moistness with a small incision and not a larger one than that which is made in phlebotomy at depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 It is necessary that you find the entire skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many arrangements does Axirnath proceed from the fissure according to the shape of a white plum-stone.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Extract it with a cloth, which you have soaked between your fingers for the outside parts; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and beware, lest you add in the fissure, so as not to reach with the spatula to the eye, and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you add a little in the fissure with ease, until Axirnath comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then extract it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the place, and bind it with small stones.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And among men are those who grind salt and place it in the hollow of the fissure, so that it melts what remains from that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If, however, a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 Chapter on Ataxmir of the eye: that is, when the eyelid becomes softened, so that it weeps as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond the course of natural hairs and turn white: then they harm the eye, and cause diseases such as continuous tearing, softening of the eyelids, and clouding, until it leads to the cause of the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And Ataxmir of the eye is cured according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 With sharp medicine, as stated in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Ataxmir is cured by incision and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 By means of reeds, as I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 Place the head of the sick man on your chest.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it therefore turns, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if it does not [turn]: insert a needle into it where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and let the needle penetrate with the thread above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread towards the upper part with the eyelid, and turn it with a flat instrument.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula slipping from the greater lacrimal to the lesser lacrimal.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small fleck of cooked wheat or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with a signet using encaustic, as in the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because it is diversified in men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 For there are those who need to be cut from the eyelid according to its large size, according to its softening part.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then with the spatula find on top of the two lines that you have marked, and start from the greater lacrimal to the lesser lacrimal, and let there be one crack near the natural hairs, as in a swelling of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scrape it all off.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then gather with suturing the two eyelids, with a sharp needle and fine woolen thread: and remove blood, and let that which superfluous exudes from the threads above the eyebrows adhere, if you wish to do so: and if not, do not treat it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then release the suture and the thread for three or four days; afterward care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, release the wound without suture, and take care of it, so that it dries up and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid is to be raised during the sealing of the wound and its closure; but it will be better later on.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of treatment was taught by Ataxmir the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is concern over the patient in this case, and it comes from a good surgery, not fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And there is another method in Ataxmir as well: and it is to make marks on the eyelid, like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have told before.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then raise the eyelid with three separated or joined combs, following this shape, then cut off what is excessive with small scissors, according to this shape, with evenness of the cut.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the comb and it does not match, then take a needle with thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the greater tear duct, and another thread near the smaller tear duct; and tie the threads evenly between your fingers.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then raise your hand with an equal elevation; and raise the skin where it is marked, as we have told before.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture; and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If, however, a boil occurs at your incision or your tear, but it is filled with pus; apply that boil with cerate and similar substances, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes the eyelashes may also turn inside out.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, you should use what we have said in the incision; but suturing is more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 On treating Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure that is inside, as I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then make two dog's jaws or two thin sticks, whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be smaller than the width of a spindle; and you have already cut at both ends where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then attach each of them to that which projects from the eyelid of the eye and tie the two dog's jaws together tightly on both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For the tightened skin will die, become black, and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it slows down (healing), then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it is healed.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 When it has consolidated (healed), lift the eyelid and do not pluck the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the shape of two dog's jaws that you should make according to this form and size (dimensions).
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 On plucking out hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is to take a fine needle and insert a thread from fine silk into it gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then join the ends of the thread and tie both with a very fine knot; let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then prepare another thin thread called Alinxotat under it and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then place the patient's head in your lap and bring it close to the sun so that the operation may be seen clearly; because this is a delicate or small operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the needle with Alinxotat into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you pull out the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then draw out the needle above the anulixotatus (a type of wound or abscess): and insert the needle into the anulixotatus, if it is one, two, or three, not more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then draw your hand with it until the needle along with the anulixotatus comes out of the eye with its natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If the anulixotatus is being pulled out and the needle does not come out with it: draw the anulixotatus downwards, with the thread you have made in it, until the anulixotatus comes out through the upper opening, and you see it with the eye: then draw out the anulixotatus and the thread; extract both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then attach a long hair from the natural hairs to it and draw it out with that: or leave it until it grows out on its own, and then draw it out.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 Chapter on the treatment of the ulcer that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this ulcer happens to the eye, it is called "Leporina".
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 This ulcer is either natural or acquired.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 The acquired ulcer occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or an incision, or a cautery, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 The method of treatment is to open the consolidation, separate its lips, and place a linen cloth between them, and tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 It is not necessary to use in the treatment of this ulcer things that dry and constrict, for if you do that, the ulcer worsens rather than improves; instead, use things that soften, such as fenugreek; embrocation with water, in which althea has been cooked, mixed with flax seed; unguent of dyaquilon, which has been melted with some oil; and wrap it with linen and treat it with that.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 Your treasure of care is to strive with all your ability, so that it does not become consolidated according to the original form.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 This indeed is not other than a correction of X-ration, so that the shape of the place does not return as it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 Section on the care of X-ration in the lower eyelid, and it is a roughening or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This that is below, is what is truly named X-ration.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 It is natural and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental one arises from a wound, or a fissure, or cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 The way of operation in it is to take the point, which has a double thread, and to anoint it with flesh, and to make it penetrate from the left tear-duct to the right tear-duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the skin.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then stretch the skin with the point upward, and cut it with a broad knife.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take the rod, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and cut two fissures on the inside of the eyelid, and let their ends be at the corners of the incision, until they converge and form an angle: until when gathered together this shape is formed, and it is the letter lauda graeca.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that skin by the amount of its sharp lower part, from the one following the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then gather the separated parts: or it with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with what we said, with softening medicines and bandages, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	If the alxahtrati occurs from a split, either by suture or cautery: then it is necessary that you explore the split flat beneath the eyelashes, as was previously done.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between two lips with a linen cloth, as we said before.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 In summary, the treatment of alxahtrati, whether it is above or below, consists of treating it according to the procedure prepared for the shape of alxahtrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 Indeed, it has many diverse forms; the skilled artisan prepares his ability in any way possible to him, so that he may return the figure to its natural form or as close to it as possible, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in various arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 Chapter on the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 When this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, one must insert the end of the rod under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, not with the sharpness of the spatula's cuts but blunted slightly; so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation and the spatula is removed without causing damage to the eye by its sharpness; and your incision should be as if you are scraping off the adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form and the adhesion heals completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then pour salt water into the eye and wash it; or let it drip onto him from a syringe made of sheep's horn with water dissolved in wine.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Separate a linen strip between the eyelid and the eye. Place wool soaked in egg white on the eye. Use it three days later, or with solid ointments until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 On the incision of the nail and swelling of the skin around the eyes.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail has two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Either it is horny: and it is like the hide of a deer, soft and brittle.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not horny, similar to frozen milk-white moisture: which, when touched with iron or attempted to be grasped with a nail, is severed and the nail does not bite into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And both types do not start until from the greater tear duct, until it gradually penetrates the vision, and prevents light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation for its incision is: that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open the eyes of the sick person with your hand and lift the eyelid.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then gather the nail with a small nail few times and extend it upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take the awl and insert a horse's or cow's hair, or that of a sheep, into it: let it be threaded and double the point of the awl slightly, and pierce it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate with the awl and tie the nail with the thread and extend it upward: and remove the hair from the side of the nail following the pupil, as if you are pulling it with the hair to the end of its.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal bone with a fine spatula or with small forceps; and let the natural flesh of the lacrimal pass without it happening that, due to the incision, there is a constant flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes, the nail extends with the only tweezers; or with thread, as I said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then scrape it with a soft spatula, whose form is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And take care that the soft spatula does not touch the horny layer and there occurs a break there and the pupil is pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, throw into the eye something of ground salt or made from wax and linen, and let it remain until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it with what is necessary, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle into it nor does the tweezers fit into it, then this type of nail should be treated frequently with medicines, and it heals as I told in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you want to cut it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a fine, soft, delicate, blunt spatula in this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And smooth the nail above with a rasp, with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it hardens and breaks and the rasp imprints on it, then pour from your hour into the eye a solution made of wax and linen or red wax or finely ground salt; and let it be closed until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the above procedure until the entire thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless it is a warm abscess in your eye; then let the former go and care for the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure on it with the rasp, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 Prominence of the lacrimal flesh, if it harms the eye greatly, should be suspended with a hook and a portion of it should be cut off; not at the end, to prevent the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then let blood from the lacrimal or red, or made from zinjarium, until it is healed. (Lacrimal: tear duct; Zinjarium: probably a type of copper vessel used for leeches or cupping)
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 Chapter on the incision of Alguardenic and flesh born in the eye. (Alguardenic is not found in any known medical texts, possibly a mis-spelling or error)
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 A red flesh composed or laid over in some human eyes is sometimes born, which covers the pupil or approaches it, or presses on the eyelids and possibly turns the eyelids outwards; resembling a rosebush.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the operation for this is also that the sick person should place his head on your chest. (Inferius means chest or breast)
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open the eyes of that person and collect all that flesh with suitable hooks; hold it with a single forceps or tweezers. (Collige = collect)
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first, until its entirety is finished with a scalpel. (incisorio = knife or scalpel)
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And beware of the eye so as not to harm it during the operation; and make your cut such that you cut it, or with a spatula (spatulam), which we mentioned in the incision of the nail; or with small forceps, with which the flesh is collected, according to what its form will be after this chapter. (Asebel: probably a tool used for collecting tissue during surgery)
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your cut is completed and all of the Alguardenic is removed, then fill the eye with salt water; or drizzle red powder on it, and similar substances from corrosive medicines; and place a piece of cotton with egg white over the outside of the eye to protect it from hot infection. (Apostemate calido: hot inflammation)
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If anything remains from the cautery and warm blood governs you, and you fear a hot abscess; then let the eye be, and treat the same along with what will calm the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then again upon it with an operation until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And similarly do with the added flesh that occurs in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary that any treatment of the weak eye, either by natural or accidental way, be performed with iron; and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that the limb can tolerate this operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 Chapter on removing a seed from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 The red veins that weave over the eye, preventing the vision from operating; and they weaken the eye with the passing of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore, it is necessary for you first to determine if the eye in which there is a seed (Sebel), is strong and there is no other illness besides the Sebel; then collect the Sebel from that eye.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And it is to command the weak one (patient) to place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend the veins with a single or double hook according to your discretion; and let the hook be fine, doubled, in this shape, or there be two hooks graduated in one body, in this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect the veins with fine forceps and remove the blood by the hour; until you see that the veins are removed from the eye and resolved; and be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 Let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation; so as not to injure except the veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then pour into the eye either green or red; so that its acidity corrodes what remains from the Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If it is not possible for you to collect the whole thing within that hour, then pack the eye with something that alleviates eye pain; and leave it for some days until the pain subsides; and secure it from infection with warm poultice; afterwards, repeat over it in the same manner until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the form of forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 Chapter on reducing a nose to the mouth.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 Physicians call the fistula known as Arissat, which you treat with a cautery or with an acidic medicine burning it, according to what has been previously stated about its treatment.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in that; unless to look for an abscess near its birthplace, and extract all the moisture and pus that is in it until the bone appears.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When the bone appears, and you see corruption or blackening in it, then grind it with an instrument of this form.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 It is called the head of a rasp.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Make it from iron, and let its head be round like a rasp, with points made by a file, or by the more subtle point of an alisclifers; and place it over the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it with your fingers and press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption is now ground away; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with the most powerful ointments of styptics.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus ceases; and it remains for forty days without being renewed, or infected, or any accident happening to it; then you will know that it is healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, there is no skill in that, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is as follows for you to expose the second bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is detected, then take the trepan in this shape, having its end iron and triangular: and the wood of it is a pyramid extended up to the end, just as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place that upon the very bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and extend your hand slightly away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the trepan until it penetrates the bone and feels weak; by this you will know that wind is escaping from it, when you hold your hand over its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore then, restore the place with medicines drying, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When therefore flesh is born and the place becomes hard; then the matter that was flowing outward returns to the nose; therefore it is easier for that over the weak.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 Section on Reducing Swelling of the Eye.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye protrudes completely and neither sight is damaged nor decreased; then it is necessary to dissolve the weakened part. Then phlebotome it. Afterward place poultices on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then place over the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloes, frankincense, and sarcolax.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then squeeze the eyelid shut with many plasters.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of plasters is to take soft cloths, many, and fold each piece over four; make many from them. Then place one on top of another, according to how much the eye needs; then squeeze them with a stiff cloth firmly on top.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 Repeat poultices with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the windy (afflicted), and let the squinting eye rest day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the ligament becomes soft again, then it must be tightened much more: Then remove the ligament after a day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If you see that the eye has returned to its original sheathing, this is good: and if not, then apply plasters, leeches, tightening (of the eyelid), and windy (afflicted), until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 Chapter on Incision of the Sheathing.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When there is a rupture in the sheathing of the eye, it then comes out and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grain of sand, and defiles the human form due to this, and one wishes to cut it: then the operation is done according to what I have said: and it is to introduce a needle at the root of the sheathing from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and let the first needle go according to its placement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie it with the sheathing in a circle around the needle: and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then pull out the needle, and place wool soaked in oil over the eye on the white of the eye: and let it remain until the thread comes out with the sheathing.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye so that it is comforted until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes the sheathing is tightened from all sides with a circle made of cloth until the eye protrudes considerably.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it is pierced with a fine spatula that reaches to the depth of the eye, and moisture is spread on the white of the eye, and the eye falls down and enters immediately: then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 Treatment of the Alcomnat.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This sickness called Alcomnat is nothing but pus that gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and it itself is not [the eye].
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method of operation in this [case] is that you make the patient sit on a prepared chair or straight.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take the head of [the patient] with both your hands at two sides and move it until you see the pus go down to the lower part of the eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it is to be shaped [the pus] and not allowed to go down, and the eye should be opened: let the patient see as he saw before: and if it does not go down below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If [the pus] does not come out as described, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a fine probe and cut through it on the horny fold at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal layer in the corona until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When it comes out [the pus], then pour hot water into the eye in which you have mixed honey or warm water in which you already boiled fenugreek and honey: then treat the rest with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 Chapter on the care of water that descends into the eye or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already said the types of water and which one is suitable for piercing according to the discussion and explanation: then take that same one in accordance with health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then you should make the patient sit between your hands, facing the light and close to the sun: then tie the healthy eye shut and squeeze it very hard: then with your right hand close the left eyelid if the water is in the left eye or the left hand if the water is in the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take your right hand, if the eye is left: or take your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the tip of your right hand near the crown on the surface of the white part of the eye visible by the smaller lacrimal duct: then push your right hand with force and you turn it while moving, until it penetrates into the white part of the eye; and feel that the instrument has reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 It is necessary that there be a measure of the journey of the instrument into depth, the space from the pupil to the end of the dark part; and this is the border of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 You will see it there in the very pupil of the eye because of the clarity of the cornea tissue.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place the instrument until it reaches the place where the water is located.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it down once after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If the water descends immediately, then the blind man sees immediately what is above him and the instrument in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If the water descends, then remove it and let the instrument come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it is fastened and does not rise up: then remove the instrument with ease; and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve something from salt in water, like a clear gemstone; and clean the eye with it inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place over the entire eye a swab of wool soaked in rose oil and white linen; and tie it with the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We and those who are of our time place over him camphor powder mixed with white linen on the eye.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the instrument does not obey you to enter the eye due to its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula called "Alberid", and this is its shape:
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Pierce therefore only the joint itself, and not the ultimate end of the hand into the opening; it is only so that you make a way to a subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Insert almagda as previously mentioned.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 Prepare for the completion of your work, a well-made sleeping chamber should be prepared for the sick man, where he can sleep on his back in a dark room; let him be prevented from all movements and coughing; and place food for him that soothes his nature; and do not move his head to either side at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 Let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve it in that dark room and test his sight; make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then lead the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 It is not necessary that he do it at the hour of healing or immediately after incision; on the contrary, let someone else do it because water rises quickly through an intense gaze.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If, however, there is a hot abscess: then it is necessary that you dissolve the eye before the seventh day; and correct it with what calms the abscess until it is calm; then remove his sight from him, and place over his oral cavity what regulates his vision for several days, he being in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then gradually leave the house and convert to his own beds.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that a student is not often excused from watching; then he dares to perform an operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 Now indeed a certain one of them who are from Alayrach has come to us, who said that a large perforation was made in Alayrach for drawing water.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Therefore, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done it; nor have I read it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 These are the forms of shapes from a handle, so that it stands upon one who does not know it.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Make them from copper: and let their extremities be with the same subtlety of triangular shape, and their extremity sharp.
Formae magda.	 Handles (plural).
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 Treatment for newborn flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Sometimes are born in the nose various fleshes similar to many-footed scorpions: and from it is a cancerous flesh, stoney, dark colored; and from it is a soft flesh, not dark colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, for that soft flesh which is not fraudulent nor cancerous, you must make the weak one sit opposite the sun with his face between your hands, and open his nose, and throw the hook into those fleshes; then draw them out towards the outside, and cut what you have caught with a thin spatula sharp at one end, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If something remains from that which the removal is not possible: then scrape it with one of the fine instruments until there remains nothing of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If blood dominates you or a hot abscess happens: then oppose it as required; or it is from malignant abscesses, then hurry to cauterize him until the blood is separated and all fleshes are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then throw into the nose after the cut vinegar, water or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If the nose opens and liquid comes out to the palate, then you know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If the liquid does not penetrate as required, then you know that there is newborn flesh within the bones of the nose, which did not reach with the cut.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then it is necessary that you insert a thickened thread of linen with many knots; and place between every knot an amount equal to a digit or less; and have the weak one, so that he sends forth one end of the thread into the nose with a radish, or as possible for him after he has made it similar to a syringe; and draw out the smell until it reaches the cavity, and exit above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed many times this is done like Attomus' boy in schools; and it is easy for him who wants to do so.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the thread, one that exits above the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then as an assistant you tie flesh with the knots on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Make this until you know that the flesh is already with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then remove the thread; and place linen which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment inside the nose after the blood has been drained; do this for three days or more until the ointment has completely eaten away what remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then place a lead tube at the end of the matter into the nose for some days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If it requires treatment to dry it out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For the nose purge, when olive oil and other medications are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or copper; it should be similar to a small lamp, open like a snail shell; and its passage likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a cane.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the snail shell instrument for nose purge should be full, pierced; which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil or what you wish from juices and fluid substances in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 This is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 On the treatment of a nasal polyp.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius translates to: "Thelul often appears at the end of the nose and grows and becomes more prominent with days until its appearance becomes disgusting.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 "And on account of this, it is necessary to cut it at the beginning of its appearance and to remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 "Then place over that spot, either a cautery or a medicine burning in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 "If cutting it does not cause it to disappear before it becomes prominent, then examine if it is hard, dark colored and has few sensations; in this case do not touch it with iron because it is a cancerous ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 "For often I have seen that someone cut an apothema and great harm came to the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 "If the apothema is soft to touch, not dark colored and it appears that cutting it can be performed on its entirety, then evacuate the weak part of it and cut it without fear, without dread; and care for the place with it so that it drains and constricts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 "On suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	 "Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 "Know that when discontinuity of one of these cartilages occurs, the operation does not help much unless in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "Therefore when something happens to anyone from that, you should examine if it is a recent wound with its blood; in this case apply double the size of the wound with stitches; then take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 "And if the discontinuity of the lips has already separated and each part is healthy; then it is necessary to remove all parts appearing from the skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 "Then attach the two lips with stitches and bind them, and sprinkle over it powder of dragon's blood and pulverized olibanum; and put on top of powders a fragment of consolidated emplaster such as diafinicon or another stronger emplaster; and leave it bound for two days or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it, and change the medicine; and let it go until the threads separate by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is to gather the solution of continuity with needles, as we have said in the surgery of the abdomen; or gather the solution with thread, as I have told you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 Chapter on the extraction of lip nodes.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many men suffer from ulcers similar to hard grains of wheat in the internal parts of their lips, and some of them are smaller, and others are larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, one must turn the lip, and search for every knot of it, and hang it up with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after the incision with fine sediment until the blood is separated.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then it is to be anointed with vinegar, and the place where there is the obstruction is to be rubbed with it until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 § On the incision of a child's flesh on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often, a piece of flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients called abscess.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore, it must be hung up with a hook, or held with forceps and cut at the root, and allow the pus or blood to flow out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place fine sediment or other powdered purgatives on the place.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If that piece of flesh returns after treatment, which often happens, then it should be cut a second time and cauterized; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 § On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 When they accumulate on the surfaces of Teeth from both interior and exterior parts, between gums and rough cortices, and sometimes turn yellow or green, until corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore, one should make the sick person sit between your hands and lean his head in your lap, and file the pulp and tooth, where you see the cortex, until nothing remains of it, and similarly do for blackening, greenness, yellowing, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If what is inside them is removed at the beginning of the reasoning, it is good; and if not, then apply the filing on them day by day, second, and third, until finally the effort reaches what you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth requires rasors of various shapes and forms, many figures; according to which it is prepared for your operation; because the rasp used to file the tooth from below is different from the rasp used to file between the teeth, due to their other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these shapes of rasors should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 Chapter on the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 One should cure the Tooth from its pain with all skill and be patient in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For there is no replacement for it when it is extracted; since it is a substance raised up; until there is no excuse for extracting it, then one who is sick must extract it himself, to strengthen and assure you that the tooth in pain is extracted.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 For many times pain deceives the sick man and believes that it is in the tooth and extracts it himself; then the pain does not subside until the sick tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When it is confirmed to you that the toothache himself is sworn, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there should be something of virtue, until it dissolves the gums from all sides: afterwards move it yourself with your fingers, or with subtle forceps in the first place gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place large forceps there at a good position, and hold the head of the weak one between your knees: what you have already tightly held, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth in a straight line, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a cloth and tie it with the end of a subtle radius so as not to break it during your constriction with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And you must be careful when making the scarification around the gums from all sides.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And keep your strength so as not to break it and a part remains and returns over the weak one from that greater pain which was first there.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And be careful not to do what unknowing phlebotomists do in haste and the arrogance of their own removal of it, apart from what we have said.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 Many times they make great infirmities come upon people, which are more difficult to break and all the roots remain, or some of them: or they pull it out with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often testified.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then it is to be washed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If there happens to be a bleeding from the places (for it often happens), then rub something from pigeon-shite and fill that place with it; and if not, cauterize it yourself if you do not have pigeon-shite.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The handles of delicate forceps with which the tooth is moved should be long at the ends, short at the handle, thick so that they do not split when pressed upon the tooth; as you can see, the thick parts of the handles, until when you close them, they do not bite themselves, or split: short in length, and made of iron from India, or skillfully fashioned flatiron with sharp ends: and at their ends should be teeth, some of which enter into certain ones and tighten by a suitable constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the ends are shaped like the beak of a bird which is called stork, and they are strong in constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Teeth and Removal of Broken Bones of the Jaw.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When something remains after the extraction of a tooth that breaks apart, then it is necessary to place hot iron with butter for one or two days until the location becomes soft; then introduce alum or forceps into it whose ends are similar to the beak of a bird which is called stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 The form of this forceps is:
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 Extremities should be made as flat as a file or as an aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not obey you with these forceps, then it is necessary to cauterize over the root, and to undermine the whole flesh, and introduce a tool called small Palanca, whose shape is as follows.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 Make the end short, slightly thicker; do not saturate it so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root comes out through that [opening], it is good; if not, help with these other instruments whose shapes are as follows.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The shape of the first is a triangle, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The shape of the subtle triangle.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also help with this tool having two branches, whose shape is as follows.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools like the toothpick.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also help with this tool similar to a large nail, whose shape is that of a twisted triangle with some thickness so as not to break, and do not saturate it.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many toothpick-like tools; and similarly the rest of the instruments are not counted, and the wise artisan, skilled in his art, finds himself an instrument according to which the operation and the illnesses signify to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because from diseases there are those for which the ancients did not provide an instrument, due to the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If the bone is broken from the jaw or other bones of the mouth, or it rots; then examine over it in its place with that which suits it from instruments and forceps I have mentioned for root extraction, and help with geste, whose shape is as follows.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let there be some thickness gradually, so that the bone can be tightened or held with it, and not flee or move away, until the bone comes out; and restore the place with appropriate medicines for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If however there is a small putridity in the bone, then scrape it from its putridity and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 On locking the protruding teeth over others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth emerge not according to their natural course, the shape becomes foul, and particularly when this happens in women and girls, that is, in those who menstruate.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, you must consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 If a tooth is born after another tooth and does not settle, or its removal or grinding is not possible, then uproot it. And if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is as follows:
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It resembles a small beak and is made of hard iron, with an extremely sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 Make your cut several days later, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so as not to disturb another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If it is projecting, exposed for grinding: then grind it with a file made of iron, whose shape is as follows:
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 Let it be made entirely of iron, and the handle small with many sharp points, like a file with which needles are filed: with which you grind the tooth gradually over several days with ease, so as not to disturb another tooth and let it fall; then soften it, and finally sand it with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If the tooth breaks off from which part of the tongue is injured: then it must be ground until the roughness of the fracture is removed and smoothed out; and it should not injure the tongue nor distort speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 Chapter on drilling teeth with gold threads.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When there is shock and disturbance of the front teeth due to blow or accident, and the weak person cannot hold what he eats so that it does not fall out; and you have treated them with medicines for swelling, but the treatment has not helped: then it is appropriate to string them with a gold thread. Because silver becomes green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let there be a thread of medium thickness and coarseness according to its quantity, which can pass between the Teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 The shape of the reel is such that you take the thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then you weave it with its two ends between the moving teeth (whether one or more), until you reach with the needle to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then repeat the weaving until you reach the part from which you started; and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it is completely removed; and let your constriction, which you use to tighten the thread, be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut the excess parts of the thread with scissors; and tie both ends together and twist them; and hide these within the healthy tooth and the moving tooth so as not to harm the tongue; then release the tightened part only when it remains so.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it is loosened or cut, tighten them with another thread, and it will remain in that state for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the reel of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes it happens that a tooth or teeth return after the loss of one or both at their respective places, and they are retained as we have said, and remain so; this does not occur unless by a skillful and experienced craftsman.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a tooth is fitted from the bones of an ox; and it is made in the shape of a tooth, and placed in the place where it strengthens and tightens the tooth, as we have said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Chapter on the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 Whenever a ligament occurring beneath the tongue is found, it may be either natural, as when a man is born with it, or accidental, resulting from a healed wound.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 The procedure for this is as follows: open the weak jaw at its hinge in your own mouth and lift the tongue; then cut through the sinewy ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its grasp.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it comes from the healing of a wound: then thrust a hook into it and bore through it across its width until you reach the sinewy ligament, and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And beware that there is no tear or opening in the deeper flesh, and do not cut into an artery there, lest there be bleeding.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it is irrigated with rose water or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Next, place a linen cloth under the tongue to keep it pressed down every night, so that it does not heal again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If there is bleeding, then cover the spot with a piece of damp cloth.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the bleeding persists, then cauterize the spot with a lentigo-type cautery, which is suitable for this; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Chapter on the removal of ranulas beneath the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes there occurs a cyst beneath the tongue resembling a small frog that hinders the tongue from its natural function and perhaps grows to fill the jawbone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 The procedure is as follows: open the weak jaw so that the cyst can be seen in sunlight, and observe it closely.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see it is dark or black, hard and insensate, then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 If it is cut to the white matter, where there is moisture, then throw in the hook and cut it with a sharp chisel, and release it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If blood veins during your operation, then put a piece of gauze crushed on it until the blood is cut off; then return to your operation until you extract it with its appendage.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then wash it with vinegar and salt; care for it with appropriate treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Chapter on the treatment of two molar cysts.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Whenever glands resembling goiters appear near the throat, that is, those which are called amygdalae: when you treat them as we have said in division and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If the abscess is hard, of a dark color, with few senses: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is of red color and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather let it be until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then either perforate it or let it burst itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is of white color, round and its root is fine: then it is necessary to cut it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation in it is that you consider before its operation whether the abscess of it has ceased to be warm and completed rest, or has decreased by a slight decrease: then let the patient sit facing the sun, and his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and let a servant take hold between his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, whose form is as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or bronze, which is thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 And when you press his tongue with it and the abscess is shown to you and falls onto it: then take a hook and fix it in the amygdala, and extract it as far as possible, except that you pull something from his tunics along with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with an instrument, whose form is as follows: (A sketch is provided here, I'm unable to provide an image in text format)
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It is similar to forks, but its extremities are curved so that the opening of each of them is facing the other sharply. Therefore take care that it is made from iron or brass coated with alum.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose shape is as follows: [insert image or diagram of the spatula's shape]
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 Be sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you have cut one almond, cut the other according to the same shape of the incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then after the incision, the sick person should rinse with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If however there is a flow of blood, rinse with water in which the bark of pomegranates has been boiled or with leaves of myrtle and similar things from poplar trees, until the flow of blood stops: then take care of him until he is cured.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes boils other than almonds appear in the throat.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Cut them therefore according to what I said in the incision of the two almonds equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 I myself have been cured of a woman suffering from a boil that was born in her throat, which was drawing toward choking, and she had few senses, as it had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed with a tight mouth, and already she had been prohibited from eating and drinking water: and now death had come upon her if it had remained for one day or two.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 The boil had risen only to the extent that it had expelled two branches until they came out through the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I therefore rushed quickly and tied a hook on one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it out and a large piece was removed.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then cut it off at the opening of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I made that which came out from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue; afterwards I fastened a hook on the ulcer; then I cut off part of it, and no pus ran out but a little blood; therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she began to drink water immediately, then she ate food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 Therefore I did not stop cutting from the ulcer for a long time; and the ulcer kept growing in place of what I was cutting, until it grew too long with that (woman).
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 So I cauterized the ulcer in her throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Therefore she stood after her application; then I walked away, and I did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 Chapter on the excision of a mouth ulcer.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When a catarrh descends to the mouth, and an ulcer forms, and it is long, then it is called 'perpendicular'; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a 'bubble'.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is cured with what was said in the division, and treatment does not help; and you see that the ulcer has become warm and soft; then it must be cut.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And when what comes together from it is round and not long, and it is red or dark or black, and there is no feeling in it; then it must be cut.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 There is fear for the weak in that (ulcer).
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore when you see it according to the way I said, white and long, make the weak person sit facing the sun; then press his tongue with the instrument whose description precedes; afterwards fix a hook in the mouth, and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that were said in the incision of the two wisdom teeth.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 It is necessary that you do not cut from it (the patient), unless what is added exceeds the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 If you cut more from it (the patient), you wound speech and discourse.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the incision, use what I have said regarding the incision of two almonds (teeth): and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If the sick person is afraid of the incision: then it is necessary that you use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The method of cauterization in it (the sick part) is not anything other than with sharp water: and it is that you place the head of the sick person in your armpit.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument which I have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take from the water which I have said in the chapter on cauterization, and make a not-extinguished lump of plaster, not thick nor thin, and fill with it the hollow of this instrument, whose shape is as follows:
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the extremity where the medicine is placed be concave like the concavity of a conical shell (radial groove).
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 Place the instrument with the medicine on the boil itself: and let the sick person lie on his side so that saliva runs from his mouth through the internal medicine, so that nothing falls from it to his throat and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you, from above, place it on the boil with a quantity of half an hour, until you see it turned black and calmed by the biting of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to take a curette, and wrap it around the edge of the boil, and pour the ointment with the medicine over it, and insert the curette with the ointment on top, until the ointment adheres to the boil.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Apply this frequently until you achieve what you desire with regard to cauterization of the vein.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then release it; for indeed, it will burn and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to repeat the medicine, do so; and after cauterization, cleanse the area around the vein with a cotton dipped in butter, and clean it with the same medicine; and irrigate with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 It shall be treated externally with ointments, and internally with poultices, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Therefore, this method of treatment is healthier than incision and further from fear (risk).
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the vein is also cured with something more subtle than cauterization and incision; it is cured by suffusion, as described below.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calaminthe, hyssop, origanum, rutus, sassafras, chamomile, abrotanum and similar herbs; grind them all together or some of them in a pot, submerge them with vinegar, and boil; the pot should be well coated with lime plaster; and there should be an opening in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument should be placed as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 It should be made of silver or bronze; the end with the granules should be inserted into the mouth of the sick person until the vapor reaches the vein through the tube until the vein becomes obscured greatly.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat over it frequently until it burns.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 Usually, however, the following is added to an abscess: and it should not be done unless at the decline of its warmth (heat).
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed, and roll the bark of an ox's horn on its end; so that the bone of the sick person is not burned; since the bark of the ox prevents burning the bone; and this is part of good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 On the extraction of spines, and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 In this context, "spinarum" refers to fishhooks or similar objects
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often a bone or fishhook, or some other sharp object adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, it is necessary to extract what appears visible on top of the object that impedes vision, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in sunlight and it becomes clear to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And what is not apparent to you and hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make a emetic before the food has been digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 For perhaps the attached object will be expelled through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or the sick person may swallow a fragment of nutmeg, or the root of lettuce, or a piece of dry bread crust; or he may take a dry soft sponge fragment and tie it up with thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When it reaches the place where the spine or bone is located, and it is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out as we have said: then use an instrument made of lead in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 Let it be thicker than a radius but less so slightly, and at its end let there be a hollow, into which you can insert easily; and the tip should have its head raised upward.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let it touch neither the epiglottis itself nor cause a cough; lest it push the bone or spine with it, or the physician insert his hand himself.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But if the sick person inserts it himself, that is better; because of his knowledge of the place where the thing is attached; and he pushes downwards or pulls his hand with the instrument upward, all of this according to the amount prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When the leech is treated with what I said in the division of cure with medicines, and it does not heal, then consider at the throat of the sick person in front of the sun, or under the sun after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If your sight falls upon the leech, remove it with a small hook or a thin and well-placed probe.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them (the small hook or thin probe): then take a hollow cannula, and insert it into the throat of the sick person up to his throat; then introduce into the hollow of the cannula hot iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this often, and let the sick person refrain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him receive a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and rinse his bone with it, and do not swallow anything from it; and move the water an hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 The leech drops immediately upon feeling water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If it does not come out as described, then fumigate the sick person with bedbugs, or with the tool mentioned in the treatment of an ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this repeatedly, for it will fall by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot containing live prunes with fire, and the pot should be covered with a lid having an opening; and at the opening place the end of the tool.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then pour the fumigation and place the sick person's mouth at the end of the cannula, and close the mouth so that the fumigation does not escape before you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For the leech will drop immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not drop, then repeat the fumigation repeatedly.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 Let the sick person bear thirst, eat salt and other things, but do not let him drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore, it is necessary for it to come out with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the form of the tool with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls onto it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It resembles forceps, as you can see; except that it has this hook which enters the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its end resembles the beak of a bird called ciconia, on which is the roughness of a file; when it grasps something, it does not let go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 Chapter on opening abscesses, their incision, and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL:
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 The appearances of abscesses are numerous, various according to their remembrance, namely one and one in this book; and they are diverse in their perforations, and in the cutting of them from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One is of the nature of an abscess itself, and that which encompasses it from humidities.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second mode is due to locations where it occurs in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Because an abscess happening in the head is different from an abscess happening in the anus; and an abscess happening in a fleshy place is different from an abscess happening in joints; and each of them has its own judgment according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And among abscesses are those which should not be perforated unless after the maturation of pus in them and its completion; and from these are those which should be perforated while they are raw and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As abscesses which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Because when an abscess happens near a joint and extends, as long as it becomes putrid what is in its surroundings, perhaps the ligaments or the nerves of that joint are corrupted; hence it is the cause of the contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or it is an abscess near the main member; because if you delay the perforation of it until it matures, it will harm either that one or through the main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus, so perforate it while it is immature; and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, not completed digestion, except that it is near the anus, so that it does not become putrid deeply and extend towards the interior of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or becomes at its end which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 It is necessary that you know the hour of perforation of the abscess, which has ripened according to the completion; and it is at sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuity of the head of the abscess; and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And it is necessary that you make the same perforation at a lower place of the abscess, and of greater protrusion; and the perforation should be directed towards the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of hands and feet, and in the places of arms, shoulders, necks, veins, and finally in all places without reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those which reflect (themselves), go with the perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 But when the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to leave the perforation of it until its digestion has confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Because if you perform the perforation on it before that (the digestion has confirmed), the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there are many dirt and foulness, and perhaps its edges harden, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscesses are to be perforated according to the breadth of the body for necessity; or according to that limb which needs it.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation for small abscesses, and a large perforation for large abscesses; or multiple cuts according to the likeness of the size of the abscesses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are among abscesses, in which it is necessary that the skin be concave; and it should be cut when it has already become like a cloth, and made into an end, which is already dead; such as what often happens to boils and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And among them are those which are cut by a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And from these, one which is cut as the figure of the myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 As an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And among them are those in which a round section is administered, and a crescent-shaped section; and similar ones from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 But that which has no head, like superficial abscesses, must be pierced by a superficial perforation or just with a flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, to pierce it so that it does not burst and you extract all of the pus at once; rather, extract a part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then lancet an abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do that repeatedly according to degree, until it comes out; especially if the person is weak in strength, or a woman pregnant, or a small child, or an old man decrepitus: for the animal spirit is many times resolved with the discharge of pus; and perhaps the weak person dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your perforation, by which you pierce the abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound; and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If therefore the wound of an abscess is small, or the section is flat, then administer linen cloths from linen or an old pot.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures of perforation, it is then necessary to insert linen into each fissure until they meet.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if you have cut a part of the skin in an abscess, or if you have hollowed out its circumference; then it is necessary to fill it with an old pot, or as when a cloth is sewn, or shorn with linen wool without moisture; and tie it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then cut it open, and care for it with what is necessary from an ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If bleeding occurs during your operation hour, then administer cold water and vinegar. After being soaked in them, place a cloth on the location of the bleeding multiple times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer treatment and medication, as I have described in many places of this our book, and by division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If it is winter time and the location of the excision is among many nerves: then it is necessary to pour warm powders with wine and oil, and place them on the locations.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is summer and the locations are fleshy: then it is necessary to place warm powders soaked in water or oil, or with wine and oil, and cool the entire thing.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we said, it is necessary to dissolve the excision, clean it and administer what is appropriate for its treatment until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This is therefore what is generally necessary for the knowledge of treating excisions.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the method of distinguishing, I have already said for every excision, how the way to its treatment is divided individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Chapter on the excision of excisions occurring on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 In the skin of the head occur small excisions, which are of the kind of knots, which are contained in the bags, which are like pouches themselves, as if they were sucked out like hen's bladders.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their kinds are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Among them are fat ones: and among them are those that contain moisture similar to mud: and among them are those that contain moisture similar to scabies and powders: and those similar to them, and among them are the hard, stone-like ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in the incision of all, and their extraction there is no fear, when at their incision, the artery does not make opposition.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 The operation on them is to try it with the instrument whose shape comes after this, which is called "Introductory probe", until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a transverse incision along the length of the superficial incision according to this shape: in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with the incision along line b to line g. Since the moisture is evacuated, then remove the cyst that contains this moisture, and do not leave anything in it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For often it returns if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; fill the wound with it, and let it remain until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For the cyst itself corrodes what remains from it.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then again over the wound with Egyptian ointment twice, thrice, and if necessary, until you are confident that nothing remains from the cyst; then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the abscess contains a thick knot: then cut it according to this shape, with an incision having the form of a cross; and throw forceps between the divisions of the incision, and remove it from all sides; and try your strength in extracting the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 If the artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly do for an abscess that contains stone, by incision and the same treatment, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 Incision on an abscess containing stone is easier because there is little blood or moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in certain men, in which there is not deep moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 Because I have cut off above the abscess on an old woman's head, and I found the abscess to be as hard and solid as a stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if anyone struck it with something thrown at it, it would wound itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 However, in other cases of abscesses in the head (except for these abscesses that occur in children's heads and at the roots of ears), their section should be a superficial one.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or make a perforation in them always from below part of them, so that the course of pus may be relieved towards lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then care for it with what is suitable for it from treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Chapter on the section of goiters (swollen necks) in the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These abscesses often occur in the neck, under the buttocks, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 On those which often occur on the neck, there is one kind and many; they are generated mutually; and every pustule from them is within its own proper tunica, as is in nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 The species of these pustules are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For from them there are hard ones; and from them there are those that contain liquids; and from them there are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 In that which you see good disposition from them in touch, of which it is evident that it is near to the skin color and moves to all parts, and is not attached with the neck muscles, nor with the buttocks, nor with an artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to separate it by superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line, b, to the line, g. And peel it off from all sides; and stretch two lips of skin with a scalpel or with several scalpels if needed, as we said in abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is above caution, not to cut a vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 Let the instrument not be very sharp; so as not to add your hand to the incision, or to disturb the sick person and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut a vein, or an artery, it forbids you from the operation; then place in the wound zegi powdered, or some powders that separate blood, and tie up the wound, and let it be until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes soft; or it begins to stink.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 The blood is cut through the tunica, therefore return to your operation until you finish.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then ask your index finger if anything remains of the small stitches: therefore cut and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If there is a large vein in the root of the stitch, then it is not to be cut from its root: instead, it should be tied with a strong double thread and left until it falls off on its own without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with an old lining, which you have already immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the stitch is completely cut, then it is necessary that you bring together the lips of the wound: and sew them immediately, after you see that there is no superfluous remaining.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 But if you see that there remains superfluity due to the size of the stitch, then it is necessary that you go towards cutting the root of it and pulling it out: and apply the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And that which contains humidities from the stitches, pierce it with a superficial perforation: so that you may see its matured place: and set the perforation at the place following below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply linen with ointment and similar things after the perforation to burn off what remains from corruption, until you see that the wound is clean: then take care of yourself with a stronger flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 Section on epiglottis due to suffocation inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients described this section on the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it: and this is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 In those with synanchia, it is necessary to perform a section of the Epiglottis: since no benefit can be derived from it, because all veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In those with a hot abscess in the mouth, throat or both tonsils, if there is no illness in the throat canal, it is necessary to perform a section of the Epiglottis to avoid loss from its swelling.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to cut the Epiglottis, it is necessary to make a section of three or four circles around the Epiglottis using a small incision across its width, in that place which is between two circles, and this section should be made in sifac (a cartilage-like tissue) rather than in cartilage. This location is suitable for sectioning because it is devoid of flesh, and blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the physician is timid, then it is necessary that he stretches the throat skin with a probe.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then he cuts the skin until he reaches the throat canal; he should cut the blood vessel if he sees any of it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then cut the sifac as we said; this is a sign of a throat canal section by phlegm that flows out from it when it bursts and the loss of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And leave an open wound for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When the hour comes when there is fear of swelling, gather together two lips of the wound skin and just the skin itself without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medicines that cause the flesh to grow until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The summary of the discussion we have described is as follows: Exposition is not necessary except when they see that one of these abscesses has already suffocated the throat; and a weakened person who wishes to cut his breath is raised above death; they go to section the Epiglottis so that the weakened person may breathe over the wound site with some kind of breathing, and thus be saved from death; and for this reason they commanded that the wound be left open until the malicious nature of the illness has passed, which lasts about three days; then they command to close the wound and care for it until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw with my own eyes is, that one maidservant received a knife, and sent it into her own throat, and cut with it a part of the trachea of the lungs.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was summoned for her treatment, and I found her gasping, as is the gasp of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 Therefore, I examined the wound, and found that blood had flowed out of it in small quantity.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 Therefore, I was reassured, because she had not severed the vein nor the artery; and the wind was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I approached therefore, and examined the wound, and treated it until it was well; and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness of voice; and she returned on better days to a better condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore I say that in the sectioning of the epiglottis, there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 Section on hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIIII.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This abscess called hernia of the throat is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is found much more often in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 It is according to two modes: for it is either natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 In the natural, certainly there is no congenital condition.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 Accidental is, in two modes: one of which is similar to fatty nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 The other mode is similar to an ulcer that comes from the swelling of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And in this (there is) fear, and it should not be presumed with the iron, towards it, unless in that which is small: and you prove it, and you explore it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it similar to a fatty node and it is not suspended with some veins: then cut it, as knots are cut; and extract it along with what contains it from the cavity, if it is in the cavity: and if not, then examine its entirety.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place where it should be treated, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 [Title: On Cutting over Types of Knots.]
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many types of knots, and I have already said all their species in division: and it is necessary that here the difference between a Knot and an Abscess be explained, when there is doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 I say therefore, that when an Abscess is heat and fever, and violent pains, until the boil subsides, and the overflow of pus is completed; then fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 But a Knot is not heat nor fever, nor pains; and it contains them in a bladder or sac that belongs to it, which is proper to the body: and it is closed like a pea or a date, and made like a walnut, and greater or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are, in two types: either fatty; or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a Knot, you should test it, and investigate it first with an instrument that is called a Probe, according to its form, which will come in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 The method of investigating boils and all nodes is to take this instrument and insert it into the moist place found in the boil: then you rotate your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then, lay your hand according to the measure of the size of the boil.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then extract what has been inserted, and observe what emerges in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If what emerges is running moisture, whatever its color, then cut it off with a superficial incision, as I have said regarding the other boils.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if no running moisture emerges in the track of the insertion, then you know it is greasy: cut it off above it with an incision having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and hang it up with hooks, and scrape the skin off from all sides with ease: and keep the container if possible over it, so that you can draw out the pus with the node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If the container breaks apart during the operation and it is not possible to draw out the pus, then extract it fragmentarily until there remains some.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if a little or much remains, the node returns most frequently.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it prevails over you and a little remains: then fill the wound at its completion with some corrosive sharp powders: and suture the wound, and place warm poultice over the boil where it sits, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If the node is large, then either two lips of its own accord will form, or you must treat it with that which makes it incarnate (i.e., grow inward).
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 But if it is contrary to a pulsating vein or non-pulsating one, then proceed, and fill the place with zega (a kind of powder) that has been crushed, and leave it sutured for two or three days until the wound becomes putrid and the boiling of blood subsides: then return to incise what remains from the node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 External instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	 In capitulo quod sequitur dictur de figura corporis hum
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 These are the shapes of instruments and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 Among them is the large one, among them is the middle-sized one, and among them is the small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Let them be made of iron, square at both ends properly, so that they may penetrate easily into a festered wound.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 These are the shapes of perforating instruments, and there are three kinds of them. One of them is called a beryl, that is to say, a piercing instrument.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 Among them is the large one, among them is the middle-sized one, and among them is the small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They come together to treat festered wounds, and ulcers, and abscesses, and buboes which are within bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others are round, smooth, and blunt like the large needles which are used for cushions, namely of citron, or brass, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 Better among them are those made of citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 They are also made of black lead, which come together to probe abscesses whose concavity is for reflections so that they may be reflected with their bluntness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 There are again three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because there are long ones, medium-sized ones, and short ones, according to the size of the abscess and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The shape of forceps, and there are many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because there are simple ones, that is to say those with a single curve; and there are three kinds as you see, large, medium-sized, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And among them are blind forceps: and there are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And among them are forceps with two curves; and there are three kinds of these too: and among them are forceps with three curves; and there are three kinds of these too; and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 These are the forms of scalpels with which nodes and ulcers are cut and scraped, and they are of three types, since one is large, another is medium, and still another is small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 The extremities by which cutting is done are sharp, the other extremities are not sharp; they are not used in this way except to provide aid in scraping nodes, when fear of incising a vein or nerve arises, and so that the weak may heal and find temporary relief from the burning sensation that is found with the scraping of ulcers.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are the Magnus (large), and they are of three types.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of iron and are similar to a drill with which alcohol is made; and there is a hidden spatula-like point at the wide end, which runs both internally and externally as desired, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The form of the spatula-like instruments hidden between the fingers during the perforation of ulcers; these are not grasped by the weak; and they are of three types, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The form of the ventosas (surgical instruments) with which blood flow is cut; and they are of three types, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 They should be made of iron or brass, round, shorter than you see, and fine.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And it is necessary that these forms of the ventosas be large and small with you so that you can cut blood quickly when necessary, and then when medicine is not present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, you shall not use them for the cutting of blood in every part of the body, nor shall you use them except in fleshy places: such as the thighs, hips, arms, breasts, abdomen, groin, and similar parts of fleshy areas that are moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they become small instruments similar to the fists' cores, according to their shape; with which the blood is cut off when it flows from the site of phlebotomy or incision of a vein or an artery; and sometimes they become round-shaped ones according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 On the Care of Breast Lumps in Men that resemble those of Women.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to become dirty in sleep), until they resemble women's breasts; and remain unclean after this.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Whoever is disgusted by this, it is necessary that he cuts the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line a to line b, then scrapes off all the fatty tissue.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Then fill the wound with ointment of incarnateum (a type of ointment or salve).
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather two lips of the wound with suture, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the breast, however, falls to a lower position and becomes soft due to its size, as happens with women; then it is necessary that it be excavated on both sides of the upper breasts in two crescent-shaped incisions similar in form, one containing the other at their ends so that the larger line contains the smaller, according to this form from line a to line b. Then scrape off the skin that is between the two lips and remove the fatty tissue, and administer what I have said about suturing and powders, which is necessary for care until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If, however, you do not complete the incision that is necessary for you to make, due to the restlessness of the sick or due to bleeding; then fill the wound with a cottaged cloth soaked in a corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains from the fatty tissue.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for yourself until you are healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 On the Perforation of an Abscess which happens under Titillicus.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscesses which occur under Titillicus, are of the types of hardened boils that contain cysts and those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Therefore, those which contain moisture should be opened by lunar section according to this form from line b to line g. When all that is within the abscess has been evacuated with pus, then fill it up with an old cloth and leave it for another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the cloth, and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the abscess is of the kind of hardened boils (nodules), then cut it open as we said when cutting on hardened boils equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If the wound extends such that it discharges pus, then administer cautery to it, according to what we said in the preceding text.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 Chapter: On the incision of an abscess due to Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it hardens, often an abscess occurs there; similarly, an abscess and swelling occur in veins as well.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is recognized that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery or a vein are as follows: for if an abscess is due to an artery, it is long, compacted in the depth of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, it feels as if there is a grating sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And what is due to a vein is round in the open part of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And incision over this abscess is an error, and particularly when it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is very dangerous.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, its care should be avoided with iron, and what is even more so in the extremities or head, it should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Therefore, over that which is due to the swelling of an artery opening, make an incision in the skin in lengthwise direction.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with scissors, then the artery; and free it from tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert a probe under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread at two places, as I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then puncture the place between the two ligaments with a lancet, until all the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a treatment that generates pus, until the ligaments fall off; afterwards, care for it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the abscess is due to a vein incision, then you should hold with your hand as much of the abscess with skin as possible.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert the needle at the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate. Let there be a double thread in it until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then tie the cyst with a good suture; as I told you before, in the suture of a sheep's gut, attach it to both sides with two ends of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If you fear that the thread may be drawn out, then insert another needle with another thread under the cyst near the incision. Press and bind your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the cyst in half until it comes out what is inside; then cut off the excess skin and release what was tied from there.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place the potion you have immersed in wine and oil on top of it.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply the treatment which is made with linen cloths and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 [Section title] On cyst occurring due to twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	 Chapter L. (Roman numeral)
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As a cyst occurs in arteries and veins, similarly it occurs in nerves; which happens to them due to trauma or excessive labor and similar causes; and mostly occurs at joints of hands or feet, or in any place where joints move; and the cyst is severe.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 It resembles the color of the rest of the body and is found in multiple locations without pain; when it is squeezed with violence, it feels weak, like a numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And the cyst is not gathered deep within the body; on the contrary it is under the skin and moves in every direction and does not reach toward the front or back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 Therefore, it should not be incised with iron where it is located at joints.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps it may happen as contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 In what there is in the head or the forehead, find the skin with cautery.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then hang it up with a hook and peel it; afterwards remove it, and dress the wound with suture; take care of it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 Chapter on incising an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LXI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Accidents to some men often in their bellies, and in the remainder of their bodies, a growth called Fungalia, which is similar to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Its root is subtle, and its head is thick, and they are turned inside out with their lips.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And there is among them something small, and there is among them what can be greatly increased.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 And indeed I have already seen a man, and in his belly there were two growths that were more similar to mushrooms than other things: there was no difference between them, white, with fine roots, and they turned inside out, were closed, and moisture always flowed out from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I therefore cut them and found the weight of one as X VIII ounces and in the other as VI ounces. The operation on their incision is that you consider if the patient is weak, and the growth is white, moist, with subtle roots: then make the incision with a wide spatula, and have cauteries in your presence.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For often much blood is expelled upon the incision of it: therefore approach if blood conquers you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a weak, fearful and timid person from the incision with iron, then take a well-made wire made of lead, and bind it to athelul: whose method is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add in the binding of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease to bind the lead, whenever it presses against the growth, until it is cut off and falls out without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If however the growth of thick roots is, then there is fear and horror in its incision: especially because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 However, it is possible to make an incision in the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it, so it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 Be careful not to cut what is of a dark purple color, having few senses and an offensive appearance; for it is an apostematic cancer; and I will come again with the reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Chapter on the treatment of hernia in the navel.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 A swelling of the umbilicus occurs for various reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 It arises from hernias of the sciatic nerve, which is above the abdomen; or it comes out either bowel or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 It arises from blood flowing from a vein, or an artery, as was mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or it arises from obstruction of wind in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If it is due to a hernia of the sciatic nerve and the passage of worms; then its color is similar to that of an abscess; it is soft, painless; and its position appears diverse.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the passage of the intestine, then its position is much more diverse than what we have mentioned before.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 When you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns and perhaps there is a sound; and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath and causes severe pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 If it is due to moisture, it is soft; then it does not disappear when pressed with your hand, nor can it be compressed, nor does it increase in size.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then with these signs appears an abscess turning black from the clavicle.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to fleshy matter; then it is a heavy, large, hard abscess and pus collects according to its quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If it is due to wind, then when touched it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the treatment in this case is to determine whether the swelling of the umbilicus is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind; then it is necessary to prevent its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said abscesses due to an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is due to intestine or hernia: then it is necessary that you order the patient to hold his breath and stand stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then sign with the encaustic around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Then order him to lie down on his back upon your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then circle with a broad lath around the navel at the place which you marked with the encaustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then extend the middle part of the probe upward with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind him around with a strong cord or with silk thread and the knot should be that of the alembic.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open the middle part of the probe which has been extended beyond the knot.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If therefore you find it already caught by the knot: then extract the alembic, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen; and if you find a hernia, then take it with the hook, and cut off its superfluous part.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If however it is an artery or vein (which is contrary to you): then circle it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your surgery.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them; and insert the two needles into the circle which you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then stitch the abscess in four places on the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave a gap, until the rotten flesh extends: and falls off by itself; or cut it when it has become soft and rots away.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with whatever is required from the unguents until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is from a hernia or dampness in him: then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And you draw out blood or moisture which you find there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then care for the wound along with it to make it close up.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 Chapter on Treating Cancer.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already discussed the types of cancer in the section on diagnosis and treatment methods for it; how to treat it with medicines and the need to avoid cutting or damaging it with iron. We also mentioned that cancer originates in the matrix (breast) and advised against using cautery in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a location where it can be completely removed, such as cancer of the breast or hip, and similar locations, from limbs intended to be amputated; especially when it is a small, newly developing cancer.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 But when it has become old and large, one should not approach it (to operate).
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I myself was unable to cure anyone from that affliction; nor have I ever seen anyone else succeed in treating it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when located as mentioned above, is to make an incision and release the patient from black bile several times (to drain it).
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then perform venesection on the individual if you find a clear sign of its presence (the cancer).
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the patient by applying a preparation to the area where the operation will take place.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then insert needles into the cancer that suit its location.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow out the cancer from all sides with the skin, according to examination, until no trace of its roots remains; allow blood to flow out and do not remove it quickly or cut into it directly. Instead, press out the larger blood vessels with your hand or as possible with the instruments available there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the flow of large amounts of blood from an incision in an artery or vein hinders you, then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for yourself with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 On the Care for Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV (Roman numerals).
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We have already spoken about the types of Dropsy and how water accumulates; and all signs, and its treatment with medications.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And that which is treated with iron is only the type of ascites alone; and it does not approach iron when treating the type of tympanites; neither deeply for the type of hypersarcies, because it is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have been treated for this type of Dropsy (tympanites) with medications and the treatment does not help; then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if the patient has already come to weakness, or there is another illness besides Dropsy (such as cough, looseness of bowels, and similar conditions); then beware not to treat him with iron; because it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 But if you see a patient with an excess of strength and no other illness besides Dropsy; and he is not a child nor old; then the method of operation for him is to lift the weakened patient standing in your hands, and a servant behind him presses his abdomen by hand, forcing water down to the lower part of his chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a sharp needle of this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 Let it have two sharp points and long, with a sharp tip like a needle.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, there should be something short on it so that you do not go through with it during the operation to the intestines and injure it.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if Dropsy generation is from the intestines; then it must be extended with a cut of three fingers' width below the navel towards the lower part above the breastbone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 If however generation of Hydropsis is due to liver disease: then let your section be left from the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if it is due to the spleen, then let your section be right-sided: and it is not necessary that the section should be on the side where the sick person wants to lie, so that excess fluids do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then pierce the skin entirely with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert your hand into the incision, and with a spatula scrape under the skin, as if you are peeling it off: let the quantity that is scraped off be the size of a fingernail or about that much.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce the peeled skin, until the spatula reaches an empty place: and that is the watery area.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then remove it, and insert an instrument of this form into the opening.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it is similar to a cannula: it should be made of silver, copper, brass, lead, cleaned; on its lower part there is a small hole, and on the sides there are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: the end of it should have a cut like the opening of a reed, as you see; at the top of its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore let out as much liquid from the hour as is a half measure.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Because if you let out more than necessary from it, the sick person may perhaps die by depletion of his animal spirit; or he may suffer a syncope approaching death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But let out from it according to its strength and according to the signs of the sick person's pulse and the quality of it.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 What it is, because it is immediately retained due to the skin that retains the opening which is on the sifac; about which I have told you to pierce it in this manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then on the second day use the instrument again if you see that it can bear it; and also extract a small amount from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Do this for some days without fear, and keep yourself away from error; until there remains in the water only a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you fear for the weak one, and let out a large amount from the water; then take care of him with warm sand, much sweat in the bath and sun, and wait for thirst; and take care of him with the most drying medicines until he is cured; and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, and liver, after the extraction of the water; according to what I have told you in what preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 Chapter on the care of infants born in places where their urinary tracts are not pierced.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV. (Roman numerals)
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When someone among infants is born from the womb of his mother and the head of the child is not pierced or the opening is narrowed, or it is in a wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore it is necessary to help with the piercing of it immediately when it is born, with a very sharp spatula, according to this shape.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place in the opening a thin awl made of lead and tie it; and hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When he therefore wants to emit urine, it is to be removed and mixed.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then return him.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not put lead, it is already possible that the urine flowing over the place does not allow him to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 But he whose opening is narrowed, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days until it is expanded.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those who have a hole in an improper place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 Because from the one who is born, a hole is at the end of the spine: therefore it cannot copulate to the front until he raises the penis with his hand to the upper parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 There is no generation for him because semen cannot reach the womb in a straight manner: and it is a very foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 The method of treatment in this case is to have the sick person lie on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand using a strong stretch, and cut off the head of the penis at the place of priapism, with a sharp knife or lancet, similar to cutting reeds, or like rooting something out, so that it becomes similar to the head of the penis. And let the hole fall in the middle as necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And be careful during your treatment to avoid bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 Indeed, this often occurs.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, place a bandage on the area that is bleeding and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 Chapter on Alabaster that occurs in the foreskin and penis, and on rotting, blackening, and sticking.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 Often these Alabasters occur in the penis, and it is a swelling of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this one kind is malignant, and another is not.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore, if it is not malignant, you should hang it with a fine hook and cut off the entirety of it until it is clean.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then put a bowl containing Egyptian ointment over it.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the man himself afterwards with dyafinicon ointment until he is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the Alabaster is malignant and of a foul color, then you must administer cauterization after its cutting and removal.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If Albather is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and a part of it is inside and a part outside, then you must first remove the Albather that is inside, until it hardens, then take care of it externally; because when you are caring for it at the same time, the foreskin will not heal except that it may break open.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And this also happens in the testicles, and the foreskin turns black and rots.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, you must hollow out everything that has turned black, as well as what is about to rot or already rotten.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then apply linseed soaked in honey that has been crushed, with the powder of walnuts and sieved herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If there is a bleeding, then administer cautery with lunar cautery in this manner:
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 For the cautery is useful for two conditions at once, namely for bleeding and wounds when they are wounded.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of a rod is corroded and destroyed completely within an hour: then you must insert a canal into the penis made of lead for the sick person to urinate through it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 However, in the case of the adherence of the foreskin with the head of the rod, and this adhesion does not occur except in a man whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it; and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess: therefore, you must remove it with a blunt spatula (Spatumili) until the ligament dissolves, and the head of the rod is released from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to determine exactly which one it is, then you must remove something from the head of the rod and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 When the foreskin is delicate, it may be perforated quickly due to its delicacy.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water, to prevent them from sticking together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is treated with wine of mummies until it sets.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 Chapter on the purification of infants and the treatment of errors that occur to them.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Chapter 57. Circumcision is not a release from continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is our operation, done by our will, and its use is particularly in boys, it is necessary to mark the operation as better and the way leading to health as easier.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, the ancients did not say anything about circumcision in any of their books; because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 That is because I found most of the craftsmen and phlebotomists to use mundification by circumcising with a new knife and forceps; and they use cauterization, ligature with thread, and incision with the nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And I have already tested all these methods, and found no better one than mundification with forceps, and ligature with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Because in mundification with a new knife, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers; therefore, perhaps it is the upper layer that is cut and the lower layer torn; consequently, there is a need for another incision to be made, resulting in pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with the cauterization that is done by cautery, that is, by the fingers (as used by cobblers), the incision of the tip of the male member is not made secure; because perhaps it enters the opening of that member.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 In the process of amputation when a nail, perhaps it pierces iron, and corrupts your operation; indeed, the skin of a child is naturally short, and often such things happen that do not require mundification; I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 In the use of amputation with forceps and ligament using thread, I have found it a good experiment: since forceps are proportional to the incision; therefore, because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 Since therefore you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate and they make a single incision at the same time; and there is a compression of the shape, holding the skin on all sides with it, so that no error occurs altogether.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the method of your own operation is to estimate a boy particularly, if he is among those who understand little, which you do not do, except that you tie the thread on his member only; and let it be until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him rejoice and be happy as much as possible for you because he receives understanding from it.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand among your prepared hands and not be seated; and conceal the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy sees them absolutely, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into his member and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the penis appears.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then clean it from the fact that it collects dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then tie the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Then tie below it a little ligature in addition.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold with your index and thumb the place of the lower ligature well, and cut between two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then quickly peel off the skin upward and extract the head of the splint.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow slowly (it is better this way) and sprinkle powder on top. Place a cloth over the powder on which the boiled lamb's lung soaked in rosewater has been crushed with fresh good oil: leave it on this until another day. Take care of it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The shape of the forceps for cleansing is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 There should be two pointed extremities and they should converge; the end of the nail should not extend into them. The length of both points should be equal to the length of two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 But an error occurring during cleansing is that all the internal skin may escape or part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch it from your hour with your nail before the excision of the place and cut it evenly.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If it passes three days and there remains what is inflated under the splint, then leave it until the abscess settles down, and peel off the crust easily, cut it as prepared for you, and be careful not to touch the head of the splint.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 It will not harm him that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Therefore, take care of it with the remedy that consolidates the wound with the powders mentioned in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut through the skin beyond measure and goes upwards, it will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Take care of it with that until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 Chapter on the extraction of retained worm in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	 Head LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Urinary retention in the bladder occurs due to an obstruction made from a stone, frozen blood, pus, flesh born, and similar things from those which we have said under the methods of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the urine does not resolve and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that he be weakened on his knees bent.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then let his feet be placed on top of his back, and he shall stretch out his stomach from the upper part of his back and tighten his weakened breathing as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore, when the neck of the bladder is compelled to expel the stone, the urine is discharged.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If the urine does not resolve with what has been said and there is great pain for the weak: then it is necessary to administer extraction of him with an instrument which is called syringe, whose form is as follows: It should be made from silver, subtle, soft, concave like a bird's feather quill in delicacy and radius, long like the palm of one hand and its middle: let the nozzle be delicate at the tip of it.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the method of urine outlet through it is as follows: take a double thread and tie at its end wool or cotton, good binding: insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: cut with scissors if there is excess wool, but forcefully introduce it into the nozzle like a gush.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and white goat's cheese: let him sit the weak one on a chair, and warm the bladder and his penis with moist oils, olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then introduce the syringe into the vein with ease, until it reaches the root of the vein.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then fold it above the part of the navel. (This appears to refer to a bandage or wrap.)
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe into it (the vein) until it reaches the bladder, and let the weak one feel that it has reached an empty place: this is not done according to this order unless because the channel through which it goes is where there is a twist.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then extend the thread with wool slowly. (This appears to be part of a suturing process.)
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 The vine will follow the wool. (This sentence seems unclear in context, as it does not appear to have any medical or
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then remove it (the catheter), and make the vine run through the urine way: and repeat the syringe, and do not stop doing that until the bladder is emptied, and the weak one finds relief. (This appears to be part of a process for draining the bladder.)
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Section on the quality of the cleansing of the bladder with Clepsydras. (A Clepsyda was an ancient water clock used to measure the flow of liquids, and in medical contexts
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX. (This could be a chapter or section number from
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When there is an ulcer or blood congeals or pus forms in the bladder, and it wants to distill waters and medicines into it: then make it with an instrument called a Clepsyda, and this is its form. (It seems that the Clepsyda is being described as a medical instrument used for treating conditions of the bladder.)
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is indeed deaf, that is, closed. (This sentence appears to be describing a characteristic of the Clepsyda or similar medical device mentioned
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And there are three holes in it, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see. (This description continues to describe the Clepsyda or similar medical device.)
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the hollow place where it is pushed should be according to the quantity that it can do without addition, until when it is drawn with it something is attracted from humidities: and when it is pushed, with it whatever is expelled is sent far away: this is how a Clepsyda works, which throws out naphta, that is, Greek fire in the wars of Mars. (This sentence appears to be describing the operation or function of the Clepsyda or similar medical device.)
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 When therefore you wish to discharge liquids into the bladder, introduce the end of a cannula into the liquid and draw up what forces it upward; for the liquid is drawn into the concavity of the cannula.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then introduce its end into a tube (syringe), as we have said before.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then force the liquid up with it (the cannula), for the liquid reaches the bladder immediately, so that it feels weak.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 Make a fine enema for the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Let it be made of silver or tin; its head should resemble a syringe slightly smaller in size, and below it there should be a cavity where a string can pass through.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a sheep and place the liquid in it, with which you wish to administer an enema to the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie up the bladder between two pouches with a strong suture using thick thread, and heat the liquid slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then introduce the end of the enema into the tube (syringe), then press your hand over the bladder with the liquid while applying a decent pressure until it feels weak, because the liquid has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If however the bladder is not present (for you), then take a piece of parchment, make a circle out of it, and pierce a hole in the entire circumference of it.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert a thread through the holes as they are wound (rolled).
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then join the circle together like parchment is glued; after you put into it what you wish from the liquids, oils and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie it up in an instrument, and use it as you did with the bladder by expression with your hand, until the liquid reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 On the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	 De oculo exsectando.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have already discussed the appearance of a stone, its treatment with medicines, and its distinction between stones generated in kidneys, bladder, and the whole; we have also stated that operation on a stone is performed with hand and section; furthermore, the stone generated in the bladder properly is meant; and moreover, that which occurs in the spermatic cord; and finally, I am telling you this with a clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 The stone generated in the bladder most frequently occurs in boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 Moreover, among its signs is that the urine exits from the bladder like water in its subtlety; it appears in it as white sand, and an afflicted man rubs his spermatic cord, labors with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it becomes erect and exits together with the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 The healing of boys is easy until they reach fourteen years of age.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 It is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 But it is moderate in young men, because it is between that [condition] and its cure is easier for the one whose stone is larger; and if it is small, the treatment is reversed.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 When we come to the treatment, it is first necessary that we cleanse the afflicted one with an enema, which draws out all the feces that are in his intestines; indeed, sometimes it prevents the discovery of the stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the afflicted one should be taken with his feet, shaken and moved downwards; so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder or leaps out from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then let him sit between your hands, prepared; and his hands should be under his buttocks so that the bladder becomes totally relaxed towards the lower part.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then ask him and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If you feel a stone [calculus] in the space (bladder or urethra), then immediately approach it with incision on top of it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall with your touch at all, then you should wash the finger with oil of the left hand if the boy is weak; or the middle finger if he is a young man; and introduce it into his anus, and ask about the stone, until it lies under your finger; and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press on it with your finger, and push it towards the outside to the place where you wish to make the incision; and command one of the assistants to press on the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to raise the testicles with his right hand to the upper parts; and with the other hand, remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a pointed probe (speculum) of this shape:
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find the place that is between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, on the side of the left buttock; and make the incision over the stone, and your finger should be in the anus; and make a transverse incision so that the incision outside is wide and the inside is narrow, according to the quantity, so that the exit of the stone from it is not larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 Perhaps the finger pressing on the stone in the anus during incision will compress it and come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the stone are its angles and edges, for this reason its exit is difficult due to it.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And from it [stone] is smooth, like a testicle, and round; and the exit of it will be easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 To him who has angles and edges, add a fracture (incision).
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not come out, then it is necessary that you apply pressure on it; or you tie over it as one ties a cord around a stone, which does not loosen from it; or you insert under it a subtle instrument with a curved tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If you cannot press on it, then slightly enlarge the opening (foramen).
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something restrains you by blood, cut it with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 If the stone is larger than one (small stone), first push on the bladder bone.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut it over there (the bladder).
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Next, push a small one after that; and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, then ignorance is to cut through it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Since it happens to the sick that one of two things occurs to him, either he dies or there is constant urine discharge; this is because the place does not heal at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 But administer its evacuation until it comes out; or apply pressure to the fracture with forceps until you extract it gradually.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with turpentine, aloe, and dragon's blood; bind it, place a cloth soaked in oil and wine (or rose oil) and cold water on top of it to settle down the abscess.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then turn the sick man over onto his neck and do not loosen the bandage for three days.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you loosen it (the bandage), anoint the place with oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with diaphanus ointment and basilica ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If a hot abscess or similar occurs in the wound, add catharsis and other such remedies; like if blood freezes in the bladder, and urine is prevented from passing out of it; and this is known by the passage of both blood and urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Insert your finger into the wound, and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 If it remains, it provokes the corruption of the wound, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply to it everything that is appropriate for healing, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And during the entire healing process, you must tie two thighs together and apply a poultice, because of the medicaments that are placed on the site.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and located in the penis, and a bladder stone presses against it, preventing urine from exiting; then treat it with what I described before you reach the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For many times you will be released from the incision by this treatment, for I have already proved it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And take a "Perforator" made of iron, with this shape: triangular at one end and sharp; fixed to wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread, and tie it around the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the "Perforator" iron into the penis easily, until the "Perforator" reaches the stone; and with your hand rotate the Perforator slowly on the stone; and you force the perforation until it makes the stone penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 Urine is released immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outside part of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 It breaks and comes out with the urine, and the sick one heals.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 But if this treatment is not prepared for you for some reason that prevents it; then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut across the stone on the penis between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then extract him.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Then loosen the ligament and clean the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone, unless to prevent its return to the bladder: and another ligament on top, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's exit, the skin returns to its place, and seals the wound: and for this reason, it is necessary for you to do so, when tying the upper thread, to lift the skin upward, so that it returns at the wound's edge, and seals the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Stones in Women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 A stone is rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If a stone happens to one of them, then the cure is difficult and it is forbidden due to many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One reason is that the woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And the second is, because you will not find a woman who will disclose herself to the doctor when she is chaste or married.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 The third is, because you will not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially in the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 The fourth is, distance from the place of the stone: which requires a deep incision, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity forces it, then one must accept a skilled woman: and such women are rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If you are unable to do it, then look for a chaste doctor, subtle and experienced in women's matters, or a woman who is familiar with this art: make her present, and especially instruct her to perform everything that you tell her about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 First, check if the woman is a virgin: then one must insert a finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If therefore it is found (the stone), immobilize it with his finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the weak bladder, and to investigate the stone, after she has placed her left hand on the bladder and compresses it with a good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If the stone is found, it should be gently moved from the bladder opening towards the lower part with utmost strength until it reaches the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then cut it near the middle of the bladder at the root of the hip from whatever side it is prepared, and feel for the stone in that place; and his finger should not be removed from the stone, pressing down on it; and let the incision be small in the beginning.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then introduce a ray into that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If (he) feels the stone, then he should add to the incision according to the size proportional to which the stone is coming out from there.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that the shapes of stones are numerous.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 For this reason, it is small and large, smooth and rough, long, and round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Know its shape so that it may be signified to you about that which you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood overwhelms (you), then add a little crushed wood ash at the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and make sure that you prepare yourself with the instruments which I have said for the removal of stones in men, in order to help you in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If the flow of blood overwhelms (you) and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an incised artery; then place powder on the spot and tighten it with appropriate ligatures; do not move it; and leave the stone and do not extract it yourself.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps a weak woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When the sharpness of blood subsides after days and the place rots, then return to your procedure until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 Section on watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	 Head, LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A moist worm (ramex aquosa) is not anything else but a gathering of moisture within the albubo (sifac), which is beneath the scrotal skin containing the egg (ovum): and it is called albubo (sifac).
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is in its own panniculus (fatty tissue) which nature has prepared for it on the testicle's part until it is considered mature: which is another egg and lies between the albubo (sifac) white, as we said; and this does not happen often.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And the generation of this ramex (worm) is indeed due to weakness that happens to testicles: therefore, this material flows into them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it occurs due to a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 For the color of this moisture can be sloping towards lemon (citrinitas), or red and blood-like (sanguineus rubeus), or feculent (foul-smelling), black, or watery white, and this is what is more common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which it is known where the gathering of moisture is, are these:
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 If it is in a white boil as we said, then the hemorrhoid is round and shorter in size like the figure of an eye; and it does not appear as a testicle, since moisture keeps it contained from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if there is moisture within the pouch itself, then the hemorrhoid is round like part of an eye, and therefore it bursts because it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white boil, then it falls under the sensation (of pain or discomfort).
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 Therefore, when you have knowledge of the color of moisture, then test the color of moisture in the hemorrhoid with a square probe, whose shape precedes (the hemorrhoid).
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to that which emerges in the footprint of the probe, judge regarding what is between it (the hemorrhoid and the probe).
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When we come for treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to be bled if it is possible for him, and look at his body full (of fluid).
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he lies on his back on a low bench and puts many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit on the left side of him, and order the servant to sit at his right, who extends his arm from one side of the skin of the testicles to the part of the rectum (anus).
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a broad spatula and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length up to the comb (pubic bone); and make an incision according to the rectitude of the line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white boil encompassing; and scrape and observe it, or be careful not to cut it; and let your scraping be more on the part that hangs with the testicle towards the egg (anus); and examine carefully with your scraping according to the quantity that you can handle.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then, perforate a bladder full of water with a wide perforation and drain out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate between two lips of the incision with forceps, and extend the bladder upward, and do not touch the skin surrounding the testicles holding it: and cut the bladder in any way possible for you to cut it, either entirely or piecemeal, especially the thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not examine and scrutinize [the area], there is no security in the incision lest water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 If however an egg comes out externally from its own skin during your operation hour: then when you complete the incision of the bladder, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then join two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it as any other wound until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find an egg corrupted by another blackness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels, which are the supports, fearing bleeding.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then cut off the testicle with its support, and extract the egg; afterwards take care of it as I said before.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If however water is accumulated in two parts, then you know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part as equally as you did in the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it appears to you that the operation should be one, then do so; afterwards cleanse the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And insert into the incisions a wool soaked in oil, or pink oil; and place another wool outside which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and search the bowels; and put double cloths on top of it, which are small towels; and tie them above with a ligament having six knots according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then two cloths are taken, washed, and filled with carbonic acid, according to this likeness: and the ends of it which are pressed [together] should be covered with wet wool; and they are tied together in the loins: one end is received on the anus up to the back, and the other on the part of the neck: and two ends below on the lower legs, and two other ends above on the groins; and the whole tie is tied together in the loins.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And at times, this ramel is artificially treated with a cautery in place of section, with iron: and it is to receive the cautery scalpel, subtle, and cut the skin of the testicles: and it is to be lit, as we have told: until when the sifac white containing water is exposed: then receive the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 The letter is made similar to Greek.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce it with that [tool], and it is set on fire until all the moisture exits.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then spread out the sifac with a spatula, and burn it with a subtle cautery that has been set alight, and cut it as much as possible for you, until you have excised all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And be careful not to let the fire touch the egg.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 Know that this operation is safer, farther from bleeding, and better than the operation with a section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 But if it opposes you in the hour of section, or in the hour of cauterization, an abscess, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you take care of what opposes you from that with a cure suitable for it, according to what has been mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 But if the patient is afraid and does not await this operation, because of its horror: then administer a perforation according to what I have told you: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are assured by that which I have said about the meanings, that the ramel is watery: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then pierce the abscess at its lower part with a wide spatula: and place the perforation along the length of the body, and let it be an opening wide, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place it on a heated place, and bind it, and let it run out the remaining water: then take care of it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If there is an obstruction to the flow of water at the hour when you pierce it [the bladder], and this is not due to anything else except that a white membrane causes the obstruction in the wound opening, and prevents the exit of the water: then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which water is drawn from hydropic patients, whose shape has been described earlier: or add [something] during the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, approximately so.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 When it has accumulated, then it should be punctured in the same manner, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 Treatise on the care of fleshy roots.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that, when cutting upon this fleshy root [turnip], there is a danger of leading to death in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore, it seems to me that its abandonment should be saved from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I remember the operation on it, and the appearance of the cauterizations.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 Therefore, I say that many cauterizations occur in the bodies, from which testicles are composed, and this happens for various reasons, such as.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or due to an excess of sharp or acid fluid, which flows towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or due to a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of the cauterization is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a heavy cauterization.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stone-like cauterization, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it happens due to a knotting of the arteries, and swelling of them; as has been already mentioned regarding its memory: or due to the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 Therefore, what is from the swelling of the arteries can be known by the disposition of the cauterization, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 Do not touch him completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 What is caused by the swelling of veins does not dissipate when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 Now it is possible to make a incision on this kind of thing and on other flesh; and it is so that the skin of the testicles is cut.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then stretch the egg upward and remove it along with the white; free the suspensory ligaments from the bag, tie the bag; and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If the egg is hardened with these born fleshes, then you must pull out the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an adhesion between something from the scrotum or inside the bag; then you must release all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 If there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion that is behind; then you must cut all of it and remove the egg as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 Section on the treatment of branches that occur with a tree.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 A tumor is enclosed by some swelling, resembling a bunch of grapes with the softening of the testicles; and it becomes difficult for weak movement and exercise, as well as walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this illness is due to fear, because of the memory that preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 However, we must say the operation according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 I say that you should make the weak person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then push the suspender of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the bowls which are near the thigh; let another servant hold it and stretch it with a violent extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then make a broad incision across the bowls (scrotum) with a sharp and long cut, until the testicles are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then scrape off all the fat from every part, as we told you in the extraction of arteries in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then insert a needle with a double thread into them (the vessels), and tie it at the places where they meet veins; and tie it again at the end of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it (the vessel) in a straight middle section along the body's length and extract what collects from the foul and corrupted humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then care for the wound with wound treatment, in which pus is generated to drain the testicles that nourish one of them.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 It is not harmful through it.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If the vein happens to encompass all the vessels, then they must be drained because of this for the testicles with the vessels: so as not to be deprived of its nutriment due to incision and decay or burn, and not be beneficial with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Chapter on the care of intestinal roots.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The passage of this root (intestine) is from the incision that happens on the stretched sifach over the abdomen in the groin part of the liver.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines come out through this rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the sifach or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 These two kinds of rupture occur from various causes: either by impact, jump, shout, lifting of a heavy object or similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the mark when it is from extension of a vein.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens gradually over a long time and not suddenly; it is an abscess equal in depth to the surface; because sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And the mark of it when it is from a cut sifach, because it causes a strong pain suddenly at first; and it is an abscess different, appearing under the skin nearby; and this is due to the outlet of the intestine, and the course of it towards the exterior sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it comes out with the intestine: and this is called an Intestinal branch, and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with diarrhea.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes it runs into the intestine with feces, and is retained there; and this is a danger to the sick, because it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in treating the disease with iron there is fear; therefore, one should be careful about accidents in this.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 And the method of operation is to order the sick person to reduce the intestine with his own hand towards the concave parts within if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then it lies on its back on its neck between your hands and raises its legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then stretch the skin that follows the skin towards the upper parts, and cut the entire skin of the testicles in length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then tie the incisions with hooks on both sides of the cut according to what you need to open the cut with them; and the cut should be according to the quantity that is possible so that the egg can come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the sifak and what is under the skin of the testicles until the white sifak appears hard from all parts; then insert your index finger into the area following the testicle, into the area between the white sifak, which is under the skin of the egg, and between sifach according to it, and without the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move with the right hand to the inner skin of the testicles; and as this is done, extend the albumen upward with the left hand; and lift the egg (ovum) with the albumen towards the part of the section; and command the servant to extend the egg upward; and you dissolve the adherence that is behind by a complete dissection.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And ask your fingers if there is anything there from the intestine rolled up in the hard albumen.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If, however, you find something from it (the testicle): then push it down towards the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take the awl, in which there is a thick thread, made of ten threads like linen: and insert it into the last albumen, that is, the membrane, which follows the section, that is under the skin of the testicles; then cut the ends that project from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then arrange some of them on top of others in the shape of a cross; and bind with it the thread which I mentioned, that is, the strong ligament of the testicle membrane, until no fluid from the sacs that nourish them can pass to them: so that a warm abscess does not occur there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place the second ligature beyond the first ligature, distant from it by more than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligatures, release from the albumen under the skin of the testicles an amount equal to a finger's breadth; and cut the rest all around in the shape of a ball, and remove the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles along a line where blood and pus flow, as we said in that which was mentioned before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound; and apply the ligament that we mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes a white sifach is cauterized as we said, after its incision to fear blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 This translates to: It often happens that (something) is (happening). The original sentence does not provide specific details
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And release the ligament until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If the case should delay, then fumigate it with hot water; and place over it what I said until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then care for the wound with the rest of the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Chapter on Pneumonia.
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter LXVI (Roman numerals).
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this pneumonia, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And at first they said that it happens as we narrated in pneumonia that is with wheat.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 It is to tie vessels after cutting on them easily below; then cut in the middle, and care for it afterwards with what opens it up until the vessels fall out; and care for the wound according to what I said until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 Chapter on Disruptions that occur in groins.
Caput LXVII.	 Chapter LXVII (Roman numerals).
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When rupture occurs in groins as we said and the place emits and something from the intestines does not descend towards the testicles; and if it descends, it is insufficient, and it returns every hour; but if this continues for a time, a tear is added to the sifach until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 It happens with the extension of sifach that is in groins as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 It is because the sifach is extended; then it is softened, the place is scraped and it emits.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 Care for it with cautery as its preceding narrative said.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And sometimes it is cured with iron, in this manner: and it is, that the sick one lies upon his back on your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the place of rupture and protrusion, by incision in width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then tie the ligature and those under the skin until the white sifach is exposed, which is below the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take a radium (small rod), and place it upon the protrusion from the sifach, and press it to the depth of the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then make two incisions upon the protrusions at the end of the radius from the sifach, and connect them with a suture; then remove the end of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut the sifach at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have told you in the treatment of intestinal branches (intestines).
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then treat that with the dressing for wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 When you make a suture, clean it, and restore the wound, until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 For the sifach contracts, and no protrusion is added to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to healing.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Chapter on the softening of scrotum skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII (78).
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The skin of the scrotum is often softened in some men because the flesh that is between them becomes soft and the appearance is corrupted.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat this, that he makes the sick man lie on his back, and cuts all the softened skin that is over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather the two folds of skin together with a suture; and if you wish, remove the surplus of the softened skin by three or four stitches, or a strong one.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then make a cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then, take care of the treatment of the remaining wounds until they heal and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	 Section on Castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that Castration in our law is excommunicated: and therefore it is permitted to me, not to remember it in my book; and its remembrance is not necessary, unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One of these reasons is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when asked about it: and so that he may know its treatment if it happens to someone.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals for our benefit through it, such as sheep, goats, and cats, and similar ones among animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore, that Castration is done according to two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Through a cut and a split.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In what is performed through rubbing, the method of operation is this: we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and become loose and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they resolve and are not perceptible to touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In castration through a cut and a split, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie the sack, and cut above all the egg with one section until two eggs appear; then cut what remains after you have peeled both of them, and do not leave anything on it except a little sifaket (subtle matter), which is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than the one performed through rubbing; because rubbing perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 § On the care of a Hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hermaphrodite is from men according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is because it appears in him what follows space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, with a figure like a female wolf, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows out from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women there is one species, and it is like a female wolf over the comb like small testicles of a man, projecting to the outside; of which one is like Priapus of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the cure of the three species, two from men, and the species of one from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut the flesh added to them until the impression of them flees away.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then heal them with healing of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 As for the second species of men from which urine flows out, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any healing at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 § On the cutting of Tentigins, and the projecting flesh in wolf-women.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 A tentigo (suture) may be added over a natural part until it becomes unsightly and repulsive in appearance; and sometimes it is extended so much in some women that it reaches to copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hold excess suture with hand or hook and cut; and not to cut too deep during incision, especially at the root; so that there is no bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it in wound healing until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 Meat (flesh) arising is the flesh that is born in the opening of the matrix, until it fills the same; and perhaps it comes out to the outside like a tail; and for this reason some call the condition 'cauda'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut it as we cut a suture and care for it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 Chapter on the treatment of a woman's wound that has not been pierced.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 A woman's wound that has not been pierced, or the opening is small.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 It may be either natural (spontaneous) or accidental (traumatic).
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 Accidental is due to an illness that precedes; and it may be from flesh arising, or spisso (adhesion), or sifach (fibrous tissue); and it may occur in the deep part of the matrix, in the sides of it, in the upper or lower part of it; and it prohibits coitus and impregnation, and possibly delivery, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 Its identification is made by the appearance of an obstetrician if the protrusion is nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not apparent, then search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the protrusion is from fibrous tissue (sifach) and is near two lips; then push it out and tear it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And it is to place two small plugs on top of the lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then put your index fingers together and the woman shall be lying on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then extend the two lips forcefully until the sifach is torn subtly and the opening is created.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take thread, dip it in oil and place it on the site; let the woman rub it every day to prevent hardening of the area.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If the sifach is thick and swollen, then it is necessary to cut it with a large, sharp scalpel-like leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the opening is due to flesh growth, then hang it with hooks and cut it; use medicines that stop blood flow without causing pain such as acacia, dragon's blood, and resin mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a wide cannula of lead to prevent quick healing of the wound and keep it for several days; apply linen cloth, then treat the rest with usual care until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes there may be birth of other flesh-growths in the womb; therefore they should be cut according to this method: before it becomes a cancerous ulcer (for cancerous growth that is in the womb should not come into direct contact with iron at all).
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on Hemorrhoids, by Athaeliel and Botor of Red Wine for women.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the vein's outlets, until blood flows frequently and abundantly from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become piles; and I have already said about their species and signs in the division of them; here I will tell which ones receive treatment and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 I say that hemorrhoids which are within the opening of the womb and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment with iron for him.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those which are above the opening of the womb, where sensation falls upon them, are those that can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore it is necessary to introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then extend the anus with forceps or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then sprinkle powder upon them at the flow of blood from one of the incision wounds without biting: such as asphalt, dragon's blood, pitch, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then push his feet against the wall at the hour of six (midnight).
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Then place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and of green walnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and make it into a poultice with honey and vinegar, and apply the plaster on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If blood is separated with it, that is good; and if not, let adhesive winds (blisters) form on the back, and on the breasts, without cutting or scratching.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and dip it in the juice of tarathith, or the juice of arnoglossum, or the juice of the leaves of alaulla (wild bryony), Pontic wine, and make it sticky with it on a leaf.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When the abscess has ceased, then treat the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 Albarth however is red like a boar's head and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore it is necessary to cut what appears from it, as I said about hellebore equally: and treat it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 On the perforation of a Caesarean section that occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Quomodo operari debet Mulier in partu, et quibus cas
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 When to operate on a woman in labor and what types of lesions may occur in the womb: cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, adubelati (herpes), fistulae, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, thilil, warm abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And indeed, I have already said that all these diseases and their types, the symptoms of each one, and their treatments should be addressed in another discussion: it is necessary to discuss here the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, which is among those abscesses that collect pus. It is important to know how its opening with iron should be performed.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, consider this.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 If the pain of the abscess is acute at its onset with striking and burning sensation, and fever: if you feel it swelling, then do not perforate it. Treat it in a manner that helps maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then the woman should be made to sit on a couch with two chairs on either side, and recline or lean on her back, and place her feet at the lower part of the abdomen: her hips should be spread out, and she should put her arms under her knees and tie them together with a bandage at that point.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument used to open the womb.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 The shape of this comes later.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And when you are to administer this instrument, it should be shaped like a rod that penetrates the woman's womb without exceeding its depth and causing harm to the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the instrument is too deep, then one should place powder on the cover of the deep matrix to prevent the entire instrument from entering deeply into the matrix. One should also place a stirrup, which runs through the instrument, on the upper side. This should hold the instrument and turn the stirrup until the deep matrix opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When it appears to be an ulcer and is touched with the hand, and it is soft and tender: then one should cut it off at its head with a broad-blade.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When pus is discharged, then one should put linen saturated with rose oil into the wound: or green oil, in which there is some styptic, and place a lint and make an incision in the deep matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And place outside on the matrix, and over the comb, clean wool saturated with water in which boiled mallow has been.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be treated for two days with an ointment that suits it until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the matrix and wound are washed so that they are cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily or long aristolochia has been boiled, and then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden within the matrix, then one should refrain from treating it with iron, rather cure it with what has been said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Chapter on Obstetrics: How to treat living embryos that have come out abnormally.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter LXXXVI.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for an obstetrician to first know the shape of a normal delivery.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore the signs of this are that when you see a woman being pressed towards her lower parts, and she wants to smell air and urinate on herself from what is above her in childbirth, and she hastens the exit of the embryo: then know that this delivery is according to a natural shape, and the exit is above its head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that his belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 When it descends upon his head, the second one also descends with it, and it is cleaned from these superfluities with good purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But he who is beyond this birth is unnatural, inadmissible.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 Because sometimes the fetus comes out beyond his feet, and his body comes out before his head itself, and his feet themselves, and one hand or one foot: or the head and one hand come out: or the belly comes out: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar unadmissible figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in all these matters and to avoid error and deception: and I am showing every figure of them, and how there is intelligence in it, and it is indicated by that, and it will remain on top of him.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus comes out beyond his head in a natural delivery, and it becomes violent over the woman, and the labor is difficult for her, and you see his strength already weakened: then make her sit on a chair or women hold her: and warm up her womb with fenugreek cooked and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the midwife introduces a small spatula between her fingers and separates the second one, and cuts it with her nail until it runs out of wetness: and compresses the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 But if it does not descend, then it is necessary to cleanse the woman with fenugreek mucilage and sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then order her after the cleansing to be compressed: and make her sneeze with a snuff mixture, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus will immediately come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary that you gradually pull them back with ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If it does not comply during delivery, then place the woman on a seat and elevate her feet upwards; then strike the seat on the ground; and hold the woman so that she does not fall due to the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remaining part of the fetus; and tie his hand with a cloth, and pull him out equally; for he will also come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 § The exit of the embryo is above its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus comes out above its feet, then it should be pushed upwards; then it should be slowly turned over; and finally it should be pulled out equally.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then grasp one of his feet and gradually stretch it.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they emerge up to the hips, then command him to hold back and make her sneeze with a pinch; for he will come out if God so wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not emerge as we have said, then gradually pull the fetus back until you place him in his natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For he will then come out easily through the exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If it is not permitted as we have said, then take some mallow, aleppo pine oil, and softened gum; grind the whole in a mortar with good pounding; afterwards spread the paste of it on the woman's vulva and inside her womb.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until she feels comfortable.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that the lower parts of her are now warmed up, then apply to him a warm piece from myrrh and place it on top of him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When therefore the hour [of the operation] holds [comes], then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze, and pinch her own nose and snout; and press the lower part of the abdomen gently with pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For feces will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 The exit of the fetus over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it comes out in this manner, then insert your hands slowly.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman lies on her back, and let her feet hang downward; and she lies reclining on a bed, and embraces her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press slowly above her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then extract what is beneath her feet from the anus, until it is prepared below [ready for birth].
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and shake them violently.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press what is above the pubic bone slowly, until the fetus rises to the higher parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then insert your hands and press the fetus gently; and command the woman to be pressed, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The exit of the fetus hangs laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 Insert your hands for reducing [the fetus].
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If it cannot be reduced [positioned], then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If she cannot walk, then make her lie on a bed; and strike her legs violently with a strong blow.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the ointment you have prepared from gums [resins].
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If she receives delivery, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then study the reduction of the hands and press the fetus according to its natural shape; and make her sneeze, and command her to press herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The outcome of the fetus is above its neck, with hands spread open, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The midwife should hold the fetus' hand and then gradually turn it, equalizing its position with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is evened out, then place oil and gum over the place I mentioned.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then command him to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat and command her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then command her to press down, and make her sneeze with pepper or another similar substance.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The outcome of the prepared fetus is on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends to the mother's opening in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is expelled due to moistness.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus hangs over its face and neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus inside until you place it as needed; and command the woman to press herself several times, for it will come out easily by itself.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 The outcome of twins or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins often give birth: and sometimes three or four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, this is unusual and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 Five are indeed outside nature and do not live completely; and the afterbirth contains them, although they multiply, yet only one afterbirth; and they are separated by a string, distinguishing between them tied at the navel of each one of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they come out like a single fetus in a natural easy delivery, and they come out in an unnatural way as I have mentioned.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult at childbirth and reach what we said in unnatural figures, then care for them as we have described: let it be subtle and act with ease and slowness, and invent according to every figure with that which is prepared for him leading to health by his intellect.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Remembrance of the one formed in the womb from embryos, and they are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has been verified by me, that a woman, while giving birth, expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed ones.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 What was done by the measurement of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, this whole thing should be in the knowledge of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 Perhaps it will come to a similar one: therefore, oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 Chapter on the extraction of the dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you take care of a dead fetus with what I have said in division and it does not come out, and you must use manual operation, then you should consider the following.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is of healthy virtue and there is no danger to her from any accidents that might cause harm to her: then she should lie down on a bed on her back, with her head lower and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then wet the cervix with olive oil and mucilage of althea, fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the obstetrician wets his hand with these oils and mucilages, then he introduces it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then he shall seek a place with it where he will fix the hooks on the fetus, and places suitable for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Then consider if the fetus is prepared to come down upon its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its armpits, or in places near the ribs, and below the hypocondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If, however, the descent is upon its feet, then in the breastbone, and in its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that he holds the hook with his right hand: and places its sharp edge on that which is between the fingers of his left hand: and introduces it with ease, and fixes the hook in one of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches an empty place.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then fix another hook, or a third one, if needed: so that the constriction is equal, and it does not deviate to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then it should be extended with an equal length, and not only in a straight line, but rather moved to all parts, so that its passage is relieved: as is done when a tooth is extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it is necessary that in what is between [the hooks], the extension should be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part remains in it, then it is necessary that the midwife binds certain fingers with oil, and introduces them from the side, to turn what remains with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If a part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks should be moved to another higher place: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If a hand or another part comes out first and cannot be returned because of its constriction, then it should be wrapped with a cloth over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then extract it entirely until it comes out completely, cut it either at the joint of the foot, or at the elbow: and thus you should do this with one hand and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the head of the fetus is large, or if it encounters a dislocation during delivery, or water has collected around its head: then it is necessary to insert Spatumile (a pointed stick) between the fingers and break the head with it and remove the water; or tear it apart with the instrument called Almisdac, whose shape comes in the same chapter as those of the other instruments.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, do so if the fetus has a large head by nature, then it is necessary to cut off the amnion (algengematu); or extract it with misdach, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head emerges and becomes dislocated at the neck: then break it, until all the moisture that is in the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If it does not twist, nor submits to delivery: then cut the head piecemeal, as far as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If there is an abscess or hydatids (hydropic cysts) below the womb, then you should pierce it until the moisture runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If however the fetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction to the cervix (matrix) is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If it becomes dislocated in the abdomen or chest: then you should extract it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and break open the abdomen or chest until all that is within them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns: then let the midwife insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the cervix (matrix) is open, then insert your hand deep into the womb and search for the head with it and draw it out with your fingers up to the cervix; then insert a hook or hooks and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the bone of the matrix (uterus) is dislocated due to a hot abscess that has occurred to it: then it is not appropriate for it to be laboring on it, instead it is then necessary to administer an infusion of moist substances, oily; and apply poultices; and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on its side, then it can be turned: then what I said for a living fetus should be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If that cannot be done, it should be cut fragmentarily, and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And it is necessary that nothing at all from the second layer (membranes) inside should be left behind.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When you have completed your operation, then what I said for hot abscesses that occur in the matrices should be administered.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If bleeding occurs, it should descend into waters of styptic (a substance to stop bleeding), and the remaining cure should be administered.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 And indeed I myself have seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was; then she became pregnant again on top of it, afterward another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it became swollen until it was opened; and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore called for her treatment, and she was treated for a long time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 Therefore, on it I placed some strong adhesive plasters; and the bone came out from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then several days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I was therefore amazed when there was no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 I therefore thought that since the fetuses were dead bones.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore asked for the wound and extracted many bones while she was in good condition; and she lived thus for a long time, but discharged little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not bind here this foreign matter, except because there is knowledge and help for that which the healing craftsman administers with his hand in cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 On the shapes of necessary instruments for the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here is the form of a Structure (Clamp), to which books are adjusted, having equally two spindles at the ends of the two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 Nevertheless, this Spindle should be more subtle than the Clamp; and to make it so, either it can be made of Ebony, or from Birchwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the thickness of all the wood should be as two fingers: and the edge of each of both is like one finger, and the length of each of them is palm and a half, or less: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two reinforcements made of the same kind of wood, which are now firmly fixed on either side, whose length is half palm or less: and the width of each is as two fingers, or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two reinforcements are inserted into the bone of the Matrix, so that it opens when you turn the two Spindles.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the Spindle for opening the Matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 Make it of Ebony wood or Birchwood, in the likeness of forceps (tweezers).
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 Nevertheless, at the end of it there should be two reinforcements, as you can see here above: and the length of each reinforcement is a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When you wish to open the Matrix with it, then do this: make the woman sit on the bed, with her legs apart, opening what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two reinforcements together into the Matrix: and you hold the end of the instrument below her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with tweezers, equally according to the amount you wish for the opening of the Matrix, until the Midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 Form of Dizziness other than what the ancients called Form of Pushing, by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The form for breaking a large head (skull): it resembles a pair of forceps with teeth at the end, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it becomes like a pair of forceps in this form (the one mentioned earlier), as you can see, with teeth similar to those of a saw, on which the skull is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The form for breaking a small head (skull).
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The form of a scissor with one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The form of a scissor with two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The form of forceps with saw-like teeth, used to crush the fetal skull.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The form of a spatula with two ends for cutting off the head (skull).
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The form of two broad spatulas.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 These instruments are used in greater numbers according to their variety, and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster they are for the operation, and higher among men due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not overlook that an instrument is not prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 It is inexcusable to be without them (the instruments).
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Chapter on the second extraction (cesarean section).
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the Afterbirth is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary to instruct the woman, to retain her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze and pinch her nose and your hand over her mouth.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If she does this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take a pot, and make a hole in the cover of it; and put in them herbs opening the womb, such as balm, rue, anise, camomile, sage, cassia wood, centaury: take all these herbs or some of them, and submerge them with water, and place them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place the plug of reed on the hole of the pot cover, and another end into the womb; and hold it until the vapour reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze as we said before.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 The afterbirth will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or althea mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert your hand into the womb and search for the afterbirth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When you find it, then take it out slowly.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If it is attached deep within the womb, then insert your hand as described before until you find the afterbirth and draw it out slowly so that it does not fall down the womb due to violent attraction; rather it should be moved with ease from side to side; then more should be added to counterbalance the attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 It will obey then, and be saved, and come out from the attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If the womb is contracted, as we have already said: treat it with sneezing, and with the potion from the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If it does not come out as we have described, beware not to tire yourself in the repetition of the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 It is necessary that what comes out to the bone matrix from it (the wound), you tie it to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then, fumigate her with a four-ingredient ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 Indeed, it will rot her after days, and it will melt and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it rots, lift it from her abdomen and head, and harm the weak part of that.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered for that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already found suitable fumigations from nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The shape of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated during the retention of Secondina (afterbirth) and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make it similar to an alcohol flask or a jar, and its wide end should be placed over the fire; the fumigation should be placed on prunes; hold her until that fumigation is consumed; then repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Chapter on the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born and their anuses are not perforated, which have already been circumcised by a sharp scythe.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 The obstetrician must therefore perforate that with her finger; and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp Spatula; and let her avoid touching the muscle.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place upon him a cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with salve until he is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If she fears that it (the placenta) may stick, then place a lead pipe in the opening, and let it remain there for many days, and remove it when the child wants to come out.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now occurs obstruction of the anus, also from the hardening of wounds or abscesses.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore it must be cut (the obstruction), then treated as we said with the treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Chapter on the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodes and swellings that occur near the outside of the anus; or in a space of one member; and there is one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When the node is cut open, watery liquid, white or pusulous, flows out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And at times they (the fistulas) penetrate through these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore they are recognized by what comes out when there is diarrhea or bloating in a sick person; and perhaps worms come out from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 There are fistulas among these when they penetrate through the space, reaching to the bladder or the root of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 There are fistulas that penetrate as far as the joining of the hips and as far as the coccygeal node.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From that which is recognized as a fistula penetrating to the anus, even if it does not penetrate, it is to insert your index finger into the anus; and to insert a probe made of metal or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is a twist (tortuosity) in it, then introduce into it a thin probe made of lead, or a hair from horse's mane, until you feel the probe, or a hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it all the way through, nor does anything come out from the opening, nor any wind or worms as I said: then you will know that it is not penetrating; therefore proceed to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the urinary passage: then its sign is the outflow of urine from it, and its prohibition is this, that the place should be made firm with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 But if it is penetrating to the junction of the hip or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches up to there, if it is not twisted up to the bone; and the finding of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus comes out from it always; and that medicine does not help in it, nor does it become firm with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And in all such penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and the treatment of them is labor and vanity for him upon whom they are formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 In that which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a scalpel; according to what I tell you, and I have already proved; and it is, that it lies weak between your hands on its backside; and you loosen the legs of it up to above its hips; and its hips should be inclined towards its belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then introduce a probe made of lead or copper if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where it has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 But if the patient feels pain near the anus, then you must insert your little finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If therefore you feel that it has already pierced your finger by itself, detected, except that you feel between your finger and the bone or flesh: then you will know certainly that it is penetrating; do not labor on it, because there is no healing in it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They say that flesh heals in some men, and that the remedy for it which is hoped for is, to heat a cauterium (small rod) with subtle fire according to the width of the fistula (abscess or channel), as was mentioned before, and to insert the heated cauterium into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then do this twice or thrice, until you know that all the flesh added to the filter, which is similar to a chicken feather pen, has been burnt off.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then take care of it with linen wrapped in butter until the burnt flesh comes out; then take care of it with unguents that cause and consolidate the skin.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 If it comes out (the foreign body) and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick covering of skin or flesh between it and the foreign body: and you see that the fistula follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go on cutting with the foreign body as it is in the fistula until the incision reaches the end of the foreign body, and the foreign body is released and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean the filtering flesh that resembles a chicken feather pen, to ensure there is nothing left of it.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If blood defeats you and causes the flesh to separate between you and your operation, then it is better that you cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Because cautery with fire brings good dispositions, burning of those added tissues, and the excision of blood and moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then treat it with linen wrapped in butter or boiled cabbages until the place emits pus, and the burnt flesh comes out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which make the flesh hard; and there are ointments containing styptic and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when it is restored, then it heals; do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus and is prolonged beyond the body's superfluity: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If you therefore feel a membrane between you and her that is made of sifak or flesh, and it is near to penetration: then there is no operation in this case, except according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 This is because there are three methods for administering it in him: either to cauterize the same, as we said; or to excise it until you reach the concavity of it, so that it is possible for you to insert linen and cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed too much with the excision, so as not to cut the muscle containing the anus, and there be an unfortunate result of evacuation without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then treat it with what I said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 Perhaps it will heal; or else you remove the membrane itself and cleanse it after you cut it near to the anus, as we said, either with the probe, or with another sharp instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then cleanse those tissues filtered which are in the excision, as far as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then strive for the restoration of the entire wound with a section, and at the superior part where it consolidates; and the fistula remains open on the internal part of the anus, and it will be easier on the sick one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 Sometimes the fistula is drained in this way; it is when you insert a probe into the fistula, which is on the side of the anus near the body surface with skin and margin of the anus; then take a probe pierced at its end, which is like a needle aleskef, that is to say prepared from calfskin, in this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 Insert into it (the fistula) a thread rolled up from five threads, about the same size.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert a probe with a thread into the fistula until it follows its hollow.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it penetrates the internal margin of the anus nearby, then pull out the thread from that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and gather both ends together; and tighten each one, and let go after one or two days; and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the two ends of the thread falls off; then care for the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating; then make it penetrable in whatever way you can prepare yourself, unless it is too deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you do not have the skill to do that without damaging it (the fistula).
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it as I said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The shape of the spatulum with a sharp point used for draining a fistula, whose sharpness is very acute, and one part is not acute so as not to damage what is not necessary, as you can see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 On the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows upon their incision; and treatment for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Or they are within the anus, like bladder stones or cherries; or they resemble the seeds of grapes.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And there are small ones and large ones; and blood always flows from them, and it is single, and they are numerous.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 They are also outside the anus and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those that are outside the anus are for the most part few in moistness, from which runs yellow water or a small amount of blood with persistent flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And its treatment that is within the anus is as follows: you should instruct the patient to purge; and it shall be expressed until it appears in your sight.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, also, grasp them with scissors or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If they cannot be held with scissors due to their moistness and softening, then grasp them with a rough cloth or thick cotton pad, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them again, and dust some warm powders over the place of the incision to make it cauterize.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or cauterize them according to what was described in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not obey the expulsion, then administer a suppository to the patient containing a small purgative, so that he may be cleansed with it from the bowels, and quickly obey the expulsion when the patient purges himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If the atheres are external from the anus, then their nature is light and easy; it is as if you grasp them with your nail, or grasp them with a pair of forceps, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with what has been said until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And if one recoils from the incision with iron, then it is necessary to administer a suture for them according to this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a thread rolled up and insert it into the point (of the wound).
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then draw out the atheres towards the top, and make it penetrate with the point into the root on the other side; and roll up the ends of the thread, in the lower part of the point, and let them be wide; and tie the atheres tightly with a strong suture.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then knot the thread, and draw out the point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all the atheres, and leave one of them; do not bind (them) to each other so that excess blood flows from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or caustic over the anus and put it on the anus; and command the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then let him go until he falls (to sleep).
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When the atheres have fallen, care for them with ointments, and with the rest of the treatment, until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 Chapter on the Care of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For often they occur due to drying of feces and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When they become old and medicine does not work on them; then it is necessary to shave with the pointed spatula or with your nail until they become wet, and remove the superior layer of skin which prevents their consolidation.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then care for them until they consolidate as needed.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they do not consolidate; then shave them more forcefully than before until they bleed a lot, and then care for them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 On the treatment of the hernia of Almirmar, and not of those not hernias; and on the treatment of Athelil's sores, and of ants.
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 You should know that Almirmar is not anything other than a round knot similar in color to the body; it resembles a nail head, and it can occur throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet or fingers, and this pain occurs during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 It is necessary therefore to cut what is around the nail, and hold it with forceps or a curette, and pull it out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for that: and if you wish to cauterize it according to what was mentioned in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 Furthermore, there is a small prominence of one kind that is dry and rough, filtered, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And it often happens in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its treatment is to stretch the prominence, and cut it; or sew it with silk thread; or with hair until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine; and now the prominences that grow backwards and not backwards are pulled out with the tool I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 Moreover, a small prominence that is dry and rough, large on the surface of the body, penetrates deeply; and when cold is found, it feels like an ant bite throughout the body; and it mostly occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And its treatment is to take a needle from the goose feather or strong vulture feather; and place the needle on the ant prominence until it encircles the prominence with the circumference of the needle.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then turn your hand with the needle until it cuts what is around the ant prominence; and place it deeply into the flesh, and pull out the ant prominence from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do that with a brass or iron needle in this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Above the needle there should be a loop of thread extending to its end, so that it is pulled tight on the finger and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish, cauterize the ant prominence according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cauterization of the prominences.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 On the shapes of instruments used for enema treatment in illnesses of the anus, and solutions for the abdomen, and for colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 When an enema is made of silver, or gold, or brass, or iron beaten.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes it is made with these small and large instruments, according to those for whom it is administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore, what is given for the treatment of small children should be small; and those with weak or painful anuses, so also their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The cannula of this (enema tube), that is the upper part where it is tied, should be wide according to this method; and there should be a distinction so that it can be tied as you see, and the lower end which is inserted into the anus, should be closed, that is not open, soft, very, pulling towards fineness; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of straws, and somewhat larger but not much, and there should be a bladder in which the medicines are placed, either from an animal's bladder, or from sheepskin, which should be small in shape like that of a syringe: whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it should be perforated with many holes as is customary, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into the holes a thread, perhaps from raw silk, which should be about ten threads or around that, and bind it with it like a syringe.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When it is placed in this bladder, the upper part of the enema should be tied at two distinct points with a strong binding.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then administer the enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the form of a circle as shown here, and of holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of making a clyster is as follows: to fill the bladder or the bowel with medicine that has been heated according to the tolerance of the patient; and be careful that it is not excessively hot or excessively cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the patient lies down on his back and raises his legs towards above; and place underneath him a bedding or linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with white egg yolk, or with slippery elm gum, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then insert it into the anus gently.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then receive the one who is to administer the clyster with both his hands and squeeze it out forcefully until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the clyster and let the patient raise his legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine compels him to evacuate, then hold him as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps all night with it, it is more beneficial for the healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If you use the clyster on him with bowel diseases that cause rapid evacuation, then administer several more until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or ulcers in the anus, then make the clyster very subtle and soft, like those used for children's clysters.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is the shape of a subtle clyster on which the skin should be tightened.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Chapter on treating head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have already said in the division of wound treatment that it is appropriate for a book, and here I shall say their treatment with hand, and with medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, wounds are distinguished according to their nature and the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Thus, the types of wounds are often like a stone's throw: either a cut by a sword or knife; or a strike with a spear, wooden staff, or arrow; and similar to these things made from various objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that occur according to the parts of the body are such as a wound on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or back; and similar to these from other members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am telling the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may put forth reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I shall begin with simple head wounds, since the memory of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore, (I say).
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 If a simple head wound occurs and there is no bone fracture, consider then if it was caused by the throw of a stone or similar objects and only broke the skin; and if the wound is large and you fear the possibility of an abscess of hot matter, then hurry and perform cephalic phlebotomy immediately; do not delay this; and remove it from the blood according to its potency quantity, unless there is something prohibiting phlebotomy, especially if the blood flowing out of the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 Let the weak person take care to avoid being filled, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If something prohibits reduction (phlebotomy), then reduce from food, and do not approach meat or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 Place warm poultice on ulna if it gets a hot abscess; apply cooked wheat in rose oil alone, or with wine containing styptic agent.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If the ulna has a hot abscess, put warm poultice on it; if it is recent and still has its own blood, and air hasn't changed it yet, then apply the powder I will mention shortly; but if the air has already changed it, then put some unguent on it until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the ulna is large or from a sword cut and similar ones, do not join its edges with small stitches; then join it with suture, as I will explain about abdominal wounds in relation to their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the ulna has already been exposed by bone and hangs without retention, except for a small suspension; then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then take care of the ulna with medicines and restore the hard flesh in its place where skin is, and instruct the weak one to eat foods that are thick, such as heads (of animals) and cooked wheat, until it becomes soft; and similar ones.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If you find decay on the skin that does not adhere to the bone; then cut away the decayed part and throw it out; then take care of the remaining part.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If there is an artery or vein from which blood flows in these wounds that cannot be cut by medicine; then look for the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it uncut, then cut or tie it with Spatulilus (suture material).
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If necessity forces and it does not allow what we have said, then cauterize it to stop the blood flow.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If these wounds are small and simple, the matter is easy and light; so apply this powder to them as it consolidates them before air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method for treating a ulcerated wound.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Recipe one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: grind all well and sieve it. Fill the wound with this and apply good pressure until it adheres well to it and coagulates with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then press it with small stones on top and let it be until it does not come off, so that it does not discharge.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine will not be removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes lime alone does it when there is no olibanum or dragon's blood present for you at the moment; and the same operation is performed with it in many large wounds, when it is necessary to apply it on top of them and press them, and the wounds are recent and have not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If air has already altered the wound in some way, particularly when it is in the summertime, then there is no purpose for this powder: treat the wound with what I have said before, namely apply some digestive unguents on top of it; or apply on top of it poultices made from wheat flour, made with water and honey, until pus is emitted.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then treat the remaining part of the wound with the rest of the cure until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 If however it happens that the wound is a bone fracture and it is small, then extract it with trephine; and I will now say the treatment for skull fractures in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 On wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve or artery of the neck is cut, if it is a nerve: then there is no remedy in it, except to avoid treatment of it, as with ziniar and zegi and similar things which cause violent constriction.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because nerves harm, and they contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not place anything cold at all on the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and their continuity is with the brain, which is above the organs; and let it be that which is cured from soft medicines, such as lime plaster with sweet water several times infused with oil, or rose oil, and tuthia, when it is also washed even with sweet water: and the remaining mineral stones, according to this method, and moist unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If the wound is large, then administer a stitch: or the rolled lips of it with pulverized chalk.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then heal it, until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If the wound has depth or occurs in it a cavity in the lower part of it, where already pus collects, then perforate it at a more depressed place within it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If the artery is already cut in the wound and blood flow follows: then separate it or sever it and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity demands that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the spondyles of the throat are already fractured, or all of them, and the cartilages have been saved: then attach the lips of skin with stitches above the neck of the throat, and do not touch the throat, on the contrary support it, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tie it up with a suitable suture and let it be for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments that contain astringents and drying agents until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it. If there are fragments of bone within it, extract all of them as much as possible: and what cannot be prepared, leave it until the wound rots, separates and is relieved.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder over it as I have told you.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it seems that a bone is visible in the wound and a fistula forms: then treat it with what is mentioned in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Chapter on wounds treated with spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound made by a lance or knife and you can see its depth, then examine it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If pus comes out of the wound when the sick person is breathing heavily, then know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If its depth is not severe and it is recent with blood, do not apply powder to it from the beginning, nor tie it up so that blood does not remain in its depth and return to the heart and kill the sick person: instead, put on attracting ointment on it and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If you do not have the attracting ointment, then place old clay on the wound opening to dry what comes out from it due to moisture: and make the sick person sleep on the wound so that it runs together what collects in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If three or more days have passed since the wound occurred and there is no spasm for the sick person, nor a bad heart tremor, nor shortness of breath due to constriction, and you see that its remaining conditions are good: then know that the wound is healthy.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Care for yourself and with bandages, and in all other treatment, until you are healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If the healing is excised and it opens again, then you will know that it has become a Fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Care for it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from sword or knife cut, and it is simple on the surface of chest or back, then care for it with what was mentioned before in suturing, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 But if it has already made an impression on the bone and cut off splinters from it: then examine the wound, and rush to extract those splinters, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound rots, because extraction of them makes it stink.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 As for other wounds occurring in the remaining limbs, the judgment in treatment is that which we said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Chapter on wounds of abdomen, and outlet of intestines, and their emergence.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 Disruption that occurs in the abdomen is great, middle and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 From a great disruption, at times the intestine or number of intestines comes out.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Therefore their insertion is done and its suturing is more violent and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 And a small disruption also occurs in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore it is more difficult to reduce them if you do not rush to its insertion to its place immediately; because it swells, opens and becomes larger; therefore the entry is difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore a medium-sized disruption is better; because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Know that stitching of veins is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common stitches are used for stitching the abdomen, and for other wounds of the body; and two other stitches belong particularly to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, those are more proper for the stitching of the abdomen; and I shall tell you one by one with explanation and clarification.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, when the wound is small and something comes out from the intestine, and it becomes difficult to reduce it; then that is due to one of the two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said; or because there is distension in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When that is the case, then one should heat it (the wound), so as to immerse a sponge or wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or boil in water cumin, caraway, and spike, and wormwood along with it, until the distension is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 At times it (the solution) makes wine in which there is stipitate; and that is better than water alone in resolving the distension.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When you see the distension already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which wormwood or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For that opens up the entrance of it (the wound) when the injury is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If, however, the return of it (the intestine) is extruded again after this treatment; then stitch up the rupture with a tool used to cut piles (hemorrhoids).
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than cutting; and it is not forced to cut after necessity and lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let one part of it (the stitch) be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp; and the end should not be too subtle like a needle, but rather bluntish; and that is similar to a thorn, as you can see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary to reduce its shape back to its natural form in its own place, if possible on top of it; because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When the wound is wide at the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary to make the weak person lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then raise his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 Similarly, if the wound is in one of two parts of the belly, then place your intention and attention always in this, that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 Thus, it is necessary to introduce it into large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 In small wounds, place it as you prepare yourself.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make sure there is a devout servant present among your hands who holds the wound entirely with his hand; and join the lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then cut something from it for the one who follows to sew on something; and this is the common method of sewing one [layer].
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is that you receive a needle or a number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then cut off from the edge of the wound the amount of a ring finger, that is, of a doctor; and sew one needle through the skin in two places, with the two places of the sifac which are under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from another side, and you have already joined the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the sifac; and they become four layers.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then sew with double thread around the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are joined by a good joining.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then release the thickness of the digit and also fix another point on them; afterwards straighten it with thread, as you did with the first point.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Do not cease to do that with the required needle until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 And let the needle be of medium size between thickness and fineness; since fine needles deeply penetrate the flesh quickly, and coarse ones have difficulty entering the skin; therefore it is necessary that they should be medium in their sharpness and bluntness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not proper that the needle should be shaped at both ends of the skin close by; so as not to penetrate the flesh quickly and open the wound before its consolidation, and also so that they may not extend when sewed, so as not to prevent the wound from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the point of the needle, so as not to hurt the sick man in his sleep; and place cotton balls on both sides of the needle to hold its ends; and release them until you know that the wound has already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this kind of sewing with needles in such a manner is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Since it suffices to sew them with one needle or two, or about as many.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second sewing is common, so as to gather together with the sewing the ends of four; that is, the ends of two skins and the two ends of sifac (or one end) in its place, when there is thread on the needle equal in sharpness and bluntness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then when you penetrate with the needle these four ends, draw back the needle from the side where you began so that the thread falls out from the upper part of the wound; so that the sewing is like the sewing of cloth where they bind together cloths, and place between every stitch an amount of thickness equal to the smallness of a finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 Humans know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 With this suture I stitched up the wound that happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was larger than one palm: and from the intestines about two palms came out from the middle intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the stomach.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I returned it (the intestine) after it had remained outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound was consolidated in a space that was about 15 days: and I cured it, and it healed; and he lived after that for many years, converted to his own habits.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the physicians judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment was found nor anything from the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 I therefore put old dough on the wound twice a day, and I attended to its cleansing with water of honey until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 I will speak about two kinds of sutures according to the narrative of the language.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it begins with sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle enters the skin and moves along the length and width of the entire body: release the end of the sinew in the side where you inserted the needle, and let it penetrate to the other end from the inside part to the outside at the opposite end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this way at the same end: and release the end of the sinew that is on this side, and let the needle penetrate to the other end from the inside part to the outside; and make it penetrate with your penetration which you make it penetrate into the tendon end that is in that part until it penetrates through all of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then also begin from the same side, and extract it as well with its extremity, which is from sifac on the other side, and draw out the point that has penetrated through the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then return it into the same skin, and its extremity, sifac on the other side, with this extremity of mirach: extract it from the skin that is on its part, and do this once and then the other, and do this again after, until you have extracted all of it according to the example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 The conclusion of this stitch is that the stitches of skins should be made so that one end of the sifac is on one side of the skin and the other end released on the other side, until it is completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second type of stitch, which Galen mentioned.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This conversation is about how to do it as some physicians do, gathering all parts that join by nature and applying the end of the sifac to its other end, and the end of mirach to another.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this is done as I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is necessary that you push the point into the end of mirach close to you from the outside and let it penetrate to the inside only, and release both ends of sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the point and let it penetrate from the outside to the inside towards both ends of sifac.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both and let both penetrate from the inside to the outside towards two ends of mirach on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of stitching is better than a common and easy stitch, and it is the stitch whose preceeding has been mentioned before.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 Therefore, this is also the speech of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And they said certain ones.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The hernia stitch is to be rectified with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 That is, introduce one thread into each of them: and begin with the needle-point from the one which is near to you, and make it pass through to the other side, according to the stitching of those who sew leather equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that, when a rupture is in the middle of the belly: then the stitching of it is more difficult than of the other parts of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 But the judgment on the dressing of a wound is the judgment on all wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 That is, when you seize a fresh wound with its blood, before it changes from the air: and you reduce the bowel and bind it up, and tie it up: then place it on powder of the earth.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If the air has already changed the wound: then place some unguents upon it, which are present with you, until they cause pus: and let the threads fall, and bind them up with sifac, and cover with miret.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it thus as is the care of all wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 If there are not present with you any medicines, then place immediately upon it as soon as it begins to emit pus, old cloth: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need another medicine in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 But if you fear that the wound may communicate to the principal members in injury, then it is necessary that you immerse wool softened in oil tempered with warm temperature or in rose oil: and place it on the circumference of the places which are between the groins and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If it feels pain or punctures or rotting in the bowels (for this often happens): then clisterize it with wine of soap, black, warm: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine and become a perforating exitus penetrating to the concavity of it.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that which is from the large intestine is easier to heal; and that which is from the finer ones, is harder to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine called Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that happens to it in any way; and this is due to the multitude of its veins, and the size of them, and due to the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If however that which proceeds from the wound is serous and you are able to seize it fresh: lead it back according to your reduction method, by which you reduce intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if space has passed by it and it is already turned green or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place which has become dark from it, to prevent blood flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in serous there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of thread hanging from the bottom part of the wound outside it: to relieve your pressure on it, and removal of serous at the site of the wound, and discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Memory of the wound that occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a rupture in the Intestine and it is small: then it can be restored in certain people; because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a thrust of the lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it was an old wound; and it became a Fistula, and it discharged feces, and it became windy.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 So I placed the treatment until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it until it healed and the location became solid.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared some accident happening to the weak man, that an accident evil would occur in his belly; and it did not happen to him from that accident evil.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in better dispositions of himself, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entered the bath, and was trained in his own regimen.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some of the experienced ones said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 It is, to take ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth on the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When therefore the head is upon it, and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it will stick to it, and will not be released.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing that with the ants according to the size of the wound in its entirety.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then reduce it (the patient), and suture the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For these heads remain attached to the Intestine until it is fed, and it heals, and no harm occurs to the weak man completely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And now it is possible that the Intestine can be tied even with a fine thread; which was removed from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 It is, to take the end of this thread from the intestine, and scrape off much of it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a fine linen thread at the end of it (the intestine).
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert that thread into the point, and suture with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then reduce him to a rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 This method of suturing with ants and the intestine, is not except by the way of confidence and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a large, broad ulna (forearm bone) is especially troublesome if it is in one of the slender intestines; then there is no skill except subtlety, and there is no healing of it at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 On the care of scrotal hernia and fistulae.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 You should know that every wound or boil that becomes old and grows, turns into an ulcer and does not consolidate, and always emits pus without being cut off; then it is universally called a fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it scrotal hernia.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And indeed a fistula is, according to the truth, a filtered knot, hard, white; with which there is no pain, but it has a depression like the feather of a bird; and for this reason some call it "Risat", that is, the feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And it is moist in some hours, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps its moistness is cut off in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this moistness is much and it is little; and it is thick, and it is fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already mentioned in division when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and flesh is not born in it, is not this but because of one of the nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of these is because the blood is scarce in the body; or because it is malicious; or because there is hard flesh between it and its edges preventing the growth of flesh; or because there are many dirt and corruption; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inappropriate for its healing; or because the falling decay in the region is a kind of pestilence, or by the property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where the digestion of diseases is difficult, and the healing of boils is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone in it, or the number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown you all those causes and their signs, as well as the treatments of them along with medicines in division: it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment for Fistula and Ulcer, which is made through the way of surgery with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 You know therefore, that a Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For among them are Fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or organs; or the intestine, or the bladder, or any of the ribs: or the vertebrae of the back, or any of the joints composed together: such as the hand, and the foot: and there are those that approach the proximity of the main member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Which of these Fistulas is in this manner, is difficult to heal from illnesses and does not receive treatment, and the care with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If there is any of the Fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I mentioned and you hope for its treatment, and you wish to come to know it, then take a probe made from brass or iron if the Fistula runs in a straight line, and search it with the same.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If there is a winding in the Fistula, then explore it with a fine lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Because lead with its own body is softened and molded around the winding.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the Fistula has multiple openings, it will not be possible for you to sign on it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Cleanse therefore one of its openings from among its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the moisture with which you cleanse it runs towards other openings and flows out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then examine and search according to the method that is possible for you, so that you know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and if the Fistula has a long hollow or is near: or it is one Fistula with many openings that covers the whole thing, with all your strength: with your questioning, as you question the sick person, and by feeling pain under pressure with your hand on the spot, and similar signs from its occurrences.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When you have therefore stood over all things in a correct position, then go for treatment according to confidence: and it is that you should consider at that time, whether it is a Fistula nearby appearing, or in a safe place distant from the juncture, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you: then cut the Fistula according to what has been mentioned in my narrative, and remove what is in it by filtration, and corruptions of flesh, which is born in its opening from flesh, or membrane, and similar things: and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If a Fistula is in deep recesses and is correctly placed: then it is necessary that you cut it as deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse it from all corrupted flesh of its own.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then administer a linen swab dipped in sharp medications and introduce it as far as the concavity of the Fistula which you have seized with an iron: do this several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the Fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with ointments which produce healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 If it does not heal by this method, then cauterize it according to what we have said.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the Fistula is bone, and it has been confirmed to you in this way: then investigate it and cut it according to what I have told you: if it does not forbid you anything from vein, nerve, or main member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If a bone is exposed to you and there is something corrupted and blackened in it: then grind it down until the entire corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the bone with that which causes it to heal until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal and discharges pus as it did: then you know that you have not reached the complete eradication of corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Excise therefore over it again, and search for the reason of its recurrence, and thoroughly cleanse the wound with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, that is good: and if not, then you know that the corruption is in the depth of a distant part of the body, which you did not reach.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 It is not in that case your ability, but to let it go according to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If the rotten bone is small and accessible to you, pull it out with fine forceps that are suitable for the purpose.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are many bones, then you should carefully pull out all of them, without leaving anything behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If however the water prevents you from anything in making an incision, and there is no fear or error, then cut those waters and fleshes, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If you are not prepared to remove the bones at your hour, then place something on the wound that will rot it; and let it go until it rots what is around the bones from fleshes and waters.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And keep the wound from healing.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And tie the section which you made during your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Or place on top of it, if you are afraid, warm pitch softened with oil; or warm pitch immersed in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those waters rot and separate from the bones, their removal is facilitated, and their pulling out.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or hip, or similar, and what has rotten from it is a large part, then shave it with the final rasp, until the blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If what is in it [the wound] has become rotten and it is a large part and the rot has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to sew it up and cut it completely to the place where the rot has reached: then take care of it until it hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you about the case that happened to a man in his leg: put it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a young man of about thirty years old, who had pain in his leg, caused by something moved upon him within the body, that is, from the inside, until it reached the material at the leg, and an abscess formed a large one: and there was no external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Therefore, at that time with the mistake of physicians, until the abscess was opened, many substances gathered with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And the care was put off for him until his leg became fistulous and many openings were made in it: which all discharged pus and body fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Therefore a multitude of physicians cared for him for about two years, and he was not wise in the art of handwork, until I was called, and saw his leg and the materials that were flowing from those openings with a great flow: even the whole body of the man was already stiff, and his color was citrine.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings: and found that they were reaching each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 Therefore I approached, and cut above one of the openings until I exposed a part of the bone: and found it rotten: which was already rotten, decayed, rotten, pierced through, until it had reached the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 Prepare therefore what I have found and prepare it from corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I have appointed that there should not be in the bone except that corruption which was to be cut off and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And now I will uproot it (the corruption).
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed the wound repair with strengthening medicines at a distance (long space).
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it is not solidified.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again and found continuity of corruption with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I attempted its repair.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it is not repaired.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 I therefore tried again and did not cease cutting the bone into pieces and attempting its repair: and it is not repaired, until I cut about one palm's breadth from the bone and extracted that along with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I repaired it with medicines and it was quickly solidified and healed: and this iteration was not necessary in its operation or cutting, except for the disposition of debility of the patient, his small tolerance and my fear of him concerning death: because it happened to him at all hours from excessive evacuation of syncopal attacks.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 He was therefore healed completely and there grew hard flesh at the place of the bone, and good arrangements were made for his body, and its strength returned: and it turned back to its own dispositions: and no harm came to him from walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 If however the protruding bone at the body's place is already broken, then it should be sawed in this way: and that is: that you take a tendon, tighten it at the end of the protruding bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and put another thicker ligament from wool first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then tie [it] over the bone that is skin: and extend its extremity, so that you may draw the flesh towards the lower parts: and you shall expose the flesh on the place which you wish to cut, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a stick or a board beneath the bone at the bottom properly: because when you do this, it is not forbidden to cut corrupt flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 It is necessary that the saw be above the place of corruption a little, so that there is not corruption in the depression of the bone: and it should not appear to the senses in its appearance, and compel another [to be] its substitute for the saw.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is corrupt and not prominent but continuous with another part, and corruption is in its middle or a part of it, then expose the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place a stick beneath [it].
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Afterwards saw it from the first part, where there is corruption, until the saw is continuous with the other part: and let the saw be according to length a little away from the corruption, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the corruption is at the junction, cut the corrupted joint and saw the bone where it is continuous with another part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if corruption is at the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy except abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If corruption is in the beak of the hand or the foot, then the matter is very difficult in that [case].
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 But it is necessary for you to examine how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And abrade it and clean it according to whatever disposition is possible for you, and with whatever remedy it can be corrected for you: when it does not make opposition to the Vein or Nerve [for you].
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that the saws and knives for cutting these bones are many according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their size, and their subtlety, and their magnitude, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations indicate to you the type of instrument you need, when your study is prolonged.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of diseases: then indeed you will find that which is suitable for each disease among the instruments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 I confirm to you the number of instruments at the end of this chapter, which you place as examples upon which you cut, and the proof by which you test others.
Forma Serrae.	 Form of a Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of another Saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This form of a saw should be well made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Make the upper part of its arch sharp and the blade from iron, and the handle from boxwood, and let it be well made in the shape of a pyramid.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 Form of a Scraper for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 Let the head of this Scraper be in the shape of the head of a star-shaped nail and its points be shaped like the points of an elongated fork.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And it is not suitable unless it is used to scrape the joints when they are broken or a large and thick bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 Form of a larger Scraper.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Form of a medium-sized Scraper.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Form of a wide Scraper.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 Form of a Scraper with a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 Form of another thin Scraper.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Form of another Scraper with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Form of a small, fine Scraper.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Form of a Scraper for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also the form of a large Scraper.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This resembles a saw and its end is like a saw: it is used in many places for the scraping of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 Form of the Razor that suits its purpose, which has been made from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 The end of it is triangular and sharp-edged.
Fit ex Indi.	 Made from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, it is necessary that all the things I have said be made of razors, scalpels, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 On the incision of limbs, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Limbs become putrid either from an external cause, or from an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 If you have treated the corruption with medicinal treatment and it does not improve: and if you see that the corruption is advancing into the limb which has not been affected by anything: then it is necessary to make an incision in that limb until the point where corruption reaches, so that the sickness can be expelled through it either from death or from a greater evil caused by the loss of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign of this is that the limb turns black until it is thought to have been consumed by fire or has become rotten after turning black: until the rot spreads until the point which follows the limb and creeps throughout the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Therefore, when an incision is made and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the sting of some poisonous creatures such as sea scorpions, weasels, hedgehogs or similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If corruption or a sting is in the limb of a finger, then incise the finger and do not leave any space for the corruption to advance until it reaches the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if this occurs in the hand, then incise it from the root of the palm and do not leave any space for the corruption to advance until it reaches the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it penetrates into the arm, then incise the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If however corruption passes through and you see him about an elbow: then in that case is the death of the weak.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And to administer beyond that in treatment, is quantity virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe; then cut it off at one node: and if it enters into the heel of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 If however it rises to the knee, then cut off the leg at the juncture of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If however corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy in it except for abandonment and leaving the weak to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the manner of cutting a limb or sewing it is that you tighten the ligament below where you wish to cut, and then tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And stretch one minister ligament downwards; and stretch another minister ligament upwards towards the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the flesh is entirely exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it is cut or sewn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you lay linen cloth over all the parts, so that the knife does not touch a healthy place; and an additional injury is added to the weak, and a warm abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 If however there is a flow of blood internally while you work, then burn the place quickly; or lay on it some powders that absorb blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happens to a man in his foot; the same thing happens that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 That is, because blackening happens in the foot as a result of burning that resembles fire burning; and corruption first occurs in his toe, until it began to involve the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 The man cured himself, after he saw corruption occur in a limb with great severity, which he discovered from pain and burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and he healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And when a long time had passed for him, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 Therefore he came to me, and I attempted to regain that loss with him by placing medicine over his hand after cleansing his body: but the loss was not gained back, and it started to spread to another finger: until corruption began in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 So he called me to cut off his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for recovery of the loss from me: and I also feared death itself for him at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Since the man was above his loss.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 Therefore when he gave up hope in me, he returned to his own land: and it came to me about him, because he acted quickly, that he cut off his entire hand: and he healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I did not bring this narrative, except to be of help for that which falls under the nature of this illness: and to be a signification, and according to which it should be done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 Chapter on the treatment of sinuses, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	 Chapter XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When a boil occurs in some fleshy parts and the space of the boil extends until it collects pus: then it breaks or perforates, and what is inside the pus exits, and there remains an empty place as if it were a vessel: and the skin that is over it like a cloth that has been softened: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, nor presses on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a sinus: and it is not called a fistula: but if the space of it extends until the corruption presses into one of these parts, then it is called a fistula or a zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 The care of it is that you cut the entire skin as it rolls out; and especially when it has been refined and made like cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If you expect the skin to adhere, and that is not due to the ultimate corruption; and if there is a thickening of flesh in the skin, then treat it with Clisterium; and it is necessary to consider towards the Anus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 If it is large and there is pus that smells foul from it; then clisterize it with the Egyptian medicine which is vinegar, oil, and zinnia, taking equal parts, mixed together in a vessel; and boil it over fire until the medicine turns red; and let it come to the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take from it what is necessary for you; and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize the Anus with it; and tie up its opening, and let the medicine remain there for a quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then remove it by pressing; make that day as many times as necessary until the Anus is cleansed, and the foul smell removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And sometimes clisterize with water and ash, when this medicine is not present for you; and it is necessary to take ashes from vine wood or ashes from holly trees; and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then boil it, and clisterize with it until you trust that the Anus has been cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the sick person cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water and ash, then clisterize it with water and honey to which something of crushed zinnia has already been added.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or clisterize it with honey and wine mixed together, since the property of honey is to cleanse and wash; and wine makes the Anus adhere, especially when there is an excess of stiffness and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you do that several times and trust that the sinus corruption is already removed: then cleanse it with it, along with what causes flesh to grow within it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And you should take from the plaster dyafinicon: and you will dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine; or cleanse it with certain medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on unguents.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the opening of the sinus is narrow and a cannula cannot enter it to cleanse it: then widen it slightly with iron; or place linen wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment within it until it becomes wider.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then bring together its lips with stitching; and allow the amount that the cleansing agent can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is raised to a higher place: then cut it in a lower area that is within it, so that the pus may flow out towards the lower part; since pus when constricted at depth prevents flesh from growing within it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus at a place below as desired: then try to prepare a body part so that the pus may flow out from there easily, according to your preparation.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try not to retain anything at all from the pus within it; and take consolidating medicines that are placed on the wound, appropriate for what you desire.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 Spread them out on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 Let the linen cloth be of such size that it will provide communication for the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors directly through the opening of the sinus a hole larger than the sinus opening itself.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread a soft ointment over another cloth, according to the size of the opening; and place it on top of it, positioning it far from the orifice of the Sinus, so that the exit of pus from it is relieved; and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days, instead.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 The one who is over the orifice of Sinus, that is the one you remove at all times, so that what accumulates in it may come out; and that you know if what runs out from it is much or little; or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And when this is done again, consider the place of the Sinus itself, whether its master feels pain in it, or not; and if there is pain in it, whether it is an abscess, or not an abscess.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When therefore your medicine is thus applied and you see the matter that comes out from the orifice of Sinus, then you know if the Sinus already adheres or approaches adhesion; then solve it in the morning or on the third day; and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If, however, a subtle venom comes out from the Sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for healing of it is approaching; since there are people who have a slow generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act against this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If, however, undigested pus comes out from the Sinus after several days, then you know that the Sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If, therefore, the adhesion of Sinus is delayed and prolonged; then add in the drying treatment of medicaments; but let the physicians do this so that the medicaments are wet in substance, and dry in effect; such as unguentum dyafinicon, when the excess is added to it from zeug.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the last one to be treated is this: to receive the ointment of dyafinicon, and it shall be dissolved with rose oil, and it shall be grinded upon it an equal quantity of ancient wine in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then mix it up together, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now makes a similar action when you do not have the ointment of dyafinicon at hand, honey, when you cook it until it thickens, and use it instead.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or receive myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind all of it, and powder it over honey while it is on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then apply linen cloth over it, and bind it with a bladder: and line it with the honey you cooked, until it thickens; and powder the substance over it, and place it again on the linen cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes administered in it are long alexanders, the roots of celestial lilies, and is lily: also wheat flour, and chicory.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them plain or combined, grind them, and sift the powder: and powder it over the honey I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the case of the bladder extends and is not cured by this treatment: then you will know that corruption is deep within it: either it has made an impression on the bones or in the hard parts, or ligaments: then cure it by the treatment of fistulas, as was mentioned before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 Chapter on the care of ulcers and scratched nails, and incision of fingers, and amputation.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter CXCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Ulcer under the nail of the thumb or big toe, and perhaps in other fingers is called panaritium.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When its duration is prolonged and neglected in treatment and cauterized with heat, it may become corrupted and discharge pus until it rots the nail root; and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foul smell; and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you treat it as I have said, and your care does not do so: then it is necessary that you shave with iron the entire superfluity that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 Indeed, cautery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If the bone is healthy and the nail is also sound, and empty additions of the nail now press the flesh towards the inside and begin to pierce it, and wound it: then it is necessary that you put fine radium under the corner of the nail which pierces the flesh, and push it up; and cut the flesh easily, and put on top of it what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, corrosives, until it is removed completely.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If the corruption has already penetrated the bone, then it is necessary that you cut out the bone, and remove it; for it will never heal as long as corrupted bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see the corruption and decomposition advancing towards the finger, then cut it at one node, according to its previous description.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If the nail happens to be rubbed or struck, and a strong pain occurs, then it is necessary that you use the leech first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula crosswise from above to the desired length.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And be careful not to let the incision reach the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause a violent pain to occur on account of it, and it will become a cause for the growth of additional flesh at the site.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then take care of the place so that it alleviates the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 The finger that is born in some human hands may perhaps be entirely fleshy; and perhaps some of them have bones, and perhaps there is a nail in it; and some of them are born at the joint, or its growth occurs in some knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore, the one that is born in some knots of the finger does not move; and the one that is born at the joint of the finger may perhaps move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 The dissection of the fleshy one (of the fingers) is therefore easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 This means to make an incision at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 But the treatment of the one whose growth is at the root joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from making an incision of it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 In the one that is born at the end of the knots of a finger, then it is necessary to make an incision in the first place through a round cut up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those saws that fit for this purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 The consolidation that occurs in fingers often occurs either from the birth of a person (that is, it is born with him), or from a wound consolidation, or burns by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut off that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place linen or gauze soaked in rose oil between them to prevent them from consolidating quickly, and separate them; or place a thin lead sheet between them until the site heals as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if consolidation happens to certain fingers with the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to how it is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 Chapter on Defects in Incision.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter CXII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Uites are swollen veins filled with melancholic exudates that occur in many parts of the body; and most often they occur in the legs, especially those walking much and suffering, and those carrying heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, it is necessary to administer a strong purging of the body from black bile at times.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then perform venesection on the patient's basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 The cure of these (varicosities) with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One method is to make an incision and draw out black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 The method is also that a vein is raised and drained completely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The section [of the vein] however, is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 Firstly, apply a poultice on the leg with much warm water until the thick and foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then tie the diseased leg from the upper part of its thigh to the lower part of its knee with bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein at one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then drain the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and it is necessary that a phlebotomist firstly attends to the diseased person.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the nail downwards: until as much blood comes out as you see sufficient, and as much strength the diseased person can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Then tie it and command him to abstain from foods causing black bile; and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and that does harm to the diseased person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The method of draining is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Shave the diseased leg if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then immerse it [the diseased part] in a bath; or apply poultice on the leg of it with warm water until it turns red and the veins swell up; or exercise it with strong movement if there is no bath present, until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then make a straight incision along the vein, along its length; or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with knives and scrape off the vein from all sides, until it becomes visible; and at its appearance, it turns from red to black as if in a downhill slope.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it comes from the skin, it appears white like a sinew.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then introduce the Radium under it until it is raised and comes out of the skin; suspend it with a blind hook, softly.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then cut another section near that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then scour the skin above the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then raise it with Radii as you did before, and suspend it with another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then cut another section or several sections as needed.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then raise it up and make an incision on the last section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then pull it out to the section above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you pull it out from the section above or higher sections, until it comes out completely; then make an incision on it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If it does not obey you to pull and raise, then insert a needle with a strong thread and tie it and pull it out; or insert a Radium under it; turn your hand around all parts until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to raise it up and a harmful thing enters the patient from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you pull it out completely, then put linen soaked in wine and rose oil or olive oil over the wound area and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the vein is twisted with a curved shape and has coiling in parts and not as we said in a straight manner, then you must cut across it in all its curved parts and the points of coiling itself.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then suspend it with hooks until you raise it up completely; be careful at your cut not to cut the vein or wound, for it will be difficult for you to raise or pull it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The form of incision to heal a wound.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 Form of excision for cataract.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It is not like other incisions in sharpness nor has a pointed end to avoid damaging the vein; and it is roundish and flexible, not too fine because if it were too fine, it would cut the vein with its fineness; rather, there should be excess roundness as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 Extraction of the leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 De lactatione infantum et veteribus mulieribus.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated in warm lands such as Alizegi and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands with little softness, that is, where no herb or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its generation is from putrefaction which occurs beneath the skin, just as it happens within the bodies of snakes and ascaris worms, and worms generated between skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of the onset of this vein is that which occurs from a heated inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then it is incised.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the vein begins to emerge from that incision place, as if it were a root of a tree or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When that end appears, then it is necessary to wind around it a piece of lead weighing one keil dram, up to two drams and knots; and allow the lead to hang from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something emerges from it towards the outside, wind that up in lead and knot it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it extends too much, then cut a part of it, and wind up the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut it at the root before it has emerged entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 Since if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh; it causes an abscess to occur, and pus in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it should be treated gently and drawn out gradually until it emerges from the end of it, and nothing remains in the body from it; and this vein emerges from certain people that is five palms long and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has reached me, because the man has emerged from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If it is cut during your treatment time: then insert a probe into its hole and perforate it with a long rod until all that is in it from the matter is evacuated; and administer the putrefaction of the place with medicines for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then treat it with treatment for boils (or abscesses).
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And indeed this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings occur to it, and a branch leaves from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore treat it as we said in the section on ligature and with what was mentioned before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 Chapter on Surgery of Worms Generated Under the Skin, and it is called Boil Sickness.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter CXIIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is called Boil Sickness in certain lands among us; because it often occurs in cattle and a small worm is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it moves throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it is felt by the senses during its walking from limb to limb until it bursts wherever it bursts in the skin and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from the decay of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As worms and snakes, that is earthworms and roundworms occur in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it is feared from its malignity.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it moves in the body and rises to the head and reaches a place, then perhaps it opens there and comes out, and destroys an eye; and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 When one wishes to treat it and extract it, then this is not done unless during its walking and appearance to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, tie what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it goes deep into the flesh, and you do not find it; then place a cautery on the spot with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 The greater fear is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If you find him (the wound) already advanced near the eye, then tie a good ligature below it (the wound).
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it and extract him (the foreign body).
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 The sick person must use cleansing of his body with medicines that dissolve corrupt and bad humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let him beware from foods causing corruption.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 Chapter on the incision for Nakir's disease.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter CXV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This disease is called Nakir in our land, and it is pain that occurs in certain members, then changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And indeed, I have seen it myself, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she pulled back her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after staying for an hour, I saw a swelling moving with the thread, like a worm, rapidly ascending to her shoulder as fast as possible; so that it was like live silver running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 The pain withdrew from that place, and it was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then sat for an hour, and ran through the rest of the body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then he told me that he was turning over his whole body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 Therefore, I marveled at the speed of his exchange from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed before that, I had not seen this illness in my eyes in such a manner as I saw it now.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 Nevertheless, I have seen many who find pain to be transferred from one limb to another; and I myself did not see it as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think it to be anything but because the woman was from those who are from dry villages with brittle veins; hence, it appears that the windiness was transferred.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that it does not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delicate and bodies with moist veins; hence, the concealed veins should not be considered.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Therefore, if you wish to heal him and the patient feels that pain; then, if it is visible to you as we have said, then press upon it quickly and beneath it; cut above it, until the windiness confined there is expelled; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then heal him by pressing the body and that which expels windiness, and drive out the windiness with stinking pills and pills of serapion, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 Chapter on Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter LXVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 The arrows are diversified according to their kinds and the places where they fall on the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 The diversity of ears is as follows: because there are some with large points, and small ones; concave ones, and deaf ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And there are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And from these are tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And from these are stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 These, however, which are according to the limbs on which they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Or the limbs are hollow from main limbs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestines, bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When it falls on any of these limbs and appears to you as signs of death which I will tell you later, then it is necessary that you draw out the arrow from them, for death follows him where it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when these signs are not visible to you and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then draw it out yourself and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 The sign of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and exits from the siphac (a membrane covering the brain) is: because such symptoms occur from it as sudden deafness, scotoma (diminished vision), vertigo, redness in the eyes, inflation, redness of the tongue, spasm, confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 Blood may come out from the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 Speech may be cut off and voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 White moisture comes out from the wound place, like dough.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And it comes out from there resembling a watery consistency of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If those signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of an arrow when it falls in the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and it feels as if it were fixed in a hard object, not in a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to the pulse's movement; and blood runs black from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And this is followed by coldness of the limbs, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Therefore, know that death approaches without a doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 The sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels that follow the neck should be cut off, and the color of the patient changed.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And it exhales a large, deep breath; and it seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the pleura, which is in the chest; then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great panting with violent pain, with sighing; and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 If the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 If the arrow falls into the abdomen and becomes fixed there, something like feces or bile or a ruptured intestine comes out from the wound.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore, there is no hope for treatment or removal of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out; and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger than the patient; then know that it is deadly.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The remaining limbs, as the face, neck, throat, spatula, assistant, vertebrae dorsales, pelvis, leg, and similar members are saved according to several arrangements; when the arrow does not find an artery or nerve; and the arrow is not venomous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you what I have seen about these arrows, so that it may signify to you concerning your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 This is, because a man fell down with an arrow into his tear duct of the eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore I extracted it from the other side, under his ear fat: and he was healed, and no damage happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell to him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not get anything more from it except its small end, which adhered to its wood: and the arrow was large among the arrows of the Turks, with a soft iron, in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore the Jew was healed, and no accidental evil happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Christian's throat.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And the arrow was Arabic, and it had ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Therefore I cut above it between two cartilages: and already it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 Therefore I sharpened myself with it until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I extracted another arrow from a man who fell down with it into his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 Afterwards, after thirty days had passed and nothing changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow: and I opened it up over it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no accidental evil happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man who fell down with an arrow into his back, and the wound had consolidated on it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 Afterwards, after seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	I saw a woman who had an arrow fall into her womb, and the wound healed upon her, and the arrow remained within her; and none of her conditions were changed, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 I saw another man to whom an arrow fell on his face: and the wound healed, and it remained, not causing him much pain; and similar things happened many times.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 I removed an arrow from a prince of the King, which had fallen on his nose, and it had already deviated slightly towards the right; and the arrow was entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 Therefore, I was called for his treatment after the fall of the arrow, up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 Therefore, I found the arrow wound very narrow.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 I therefore asked her with a thin probe, and she did not feel it; and he himself was finding a puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 Therefore, I hoped that this puncture was from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 Therefore, I dressed the place with an attracting and digesting plaster, confident that the location would come out and a sign of the arrow would appear for me to cut over it; but it did not happen at the place where it was expected, indicating that the arrow had missed its mark.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I therefore continued with the plaster over him for many days; but it did not happen as expected, and the wound healed in the meantime; and the man remained weak from its extraction, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 I therefore applied sharp and corrosive medicine to that wound for many days until it was opened; and when I probed it myself, I felt a small end of the arrow adhering to wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added the sharp medicine in the wound opening until it became clearly visible to us the end of the arrowhead; and it passed with that space of time approximately four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 After the wound was opened and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, but it did not obey and came out; then I did not stop refining and devising ways on it until finally, on a certain day with properly made forceps according to the shape that comes at the end of the chapter, I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed the physicians judge that the nose cartilage cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore restored it, and the wound healed, and the illness became whole again; nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you about the quality of some arrow extractions; in order to put this rule and meaning on what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Because the parts and distinctions of this art are not comprehended with the narrative; nor does the book contain it, and the wise artist compares a little about much; and with what is present, concerning what is absent: and he finds a new operation, and a new instrument for descents of foreign matters in this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 Therefore I say that arrows do not come out of the limbs to which they are fixed, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or by attraction from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or conversely, by the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And what comes out from where it entered is either a proceeding arrow in a meaty place; and it is attracted and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not obey to come out at the hour when it falls; then it is necessary that you leave it for some days until the flesh around it putrefies; and the attraction of it will cease, and its coming out will take place.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly, if it is fixed into the bone and does not obey you to come out, then leave it for a few days; and repeatedly it with attraction and motion every day until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not come out after a few days, then it is necessary that you bore around the arrowhead in the bone from all sides with a subtle drill until the arrows are expanded.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then draw it out and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already advanced into one ventricle of the brain, and there appear some of those symptoms that I have mentioned: then abstain from drawing out the arrow, and leave it until its humour becomes equal on the following days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if the arrow reaches the siphon, then death does not prolong for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of bone only and does not penetrate up to the siphon; and remains weak for several days, and no symptoms occur from it: then apply your skills in drawing out the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If it is fixed deeply and does not obey you to draw out: then apply drill around the arrow, as I have told you; then take care of the wound until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow is already hidden in the body and concealed from sensation: then search for it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments that are suitable for drawing it out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot apply pressure on it because of the narrowness of the wound and the length of the arrow in deep: and there is no bone, nerve or vein there; then mark it until the wound expands and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If there are ears he must hold, then freely remove the fixed flesh from them on all sides, with every skill you can, and skills, if it cannot be done by dissection of the flesh due to a fracture of the ears or their twisting, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 When you perform an extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use twisting with your hand, along with tweezers in all directions, until you make it come out: and with subtlety of ultimate subtlety, so that the arrow does not break, and the attraction of it becomes difficult for you, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot do it by the hour, then leave it for some days until what is around it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then repeat it: for the tunica will soften. If, however, the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what I have said in its treatment as mentioned in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or a nerve, or a tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer your skill in every way possible for the extraction of the arrow: and let it be with facility, calmness, slowness, or firmness, as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 It is necessary that, when you pull the arrow, it should be weakened according to its shape, according to which it was at the time of the arrow's accident.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the shapes.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 The arrow that comes out from the opposite part or already proceeds to the outside, or makes a hump at the end of the arrow by the sensation of the skin on the upper side and you see it bulging: cut above it, and the cut should be according to the amount that the tweezers can grasp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then pull it out: for it is easy to come out by itself.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If it remains in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrowhead impresses into the bone and expands; then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: let it be for a few days; then draw it again until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the arrow shaft is wooden in it, then force it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If the arrow shaft fell out, and force is to be administered: then insert a concave instrument into it so that its concavity enters the shaft's tip; then force it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If the arrow is concave, then force it out with the inserting instrument.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 For the arrow is loosened by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out all the flesh where the poison is: if it is possible for you to do so.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then care for it with what is suitable for that purpose.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls into the chest, or the abdomen, or the bladder, or the side: and is near where you can reach it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut over it, and avoid cutting the vein, or nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then sew up the wound, if you see one, and take care of it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The tips should resemble a bird's beak, which have been made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And they are made in various shapes, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its smallness, and the width and depth of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 Form of the Probing Hook concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the form of the Probing Hook for the deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is the tip of the probe similar to a radius, so that it can be relieved into the concave arrowhead and pushed along with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The tip of the probe is concave like a bird's feather, so that it can be relieved into the arrowhead itself and pushed along with it.

Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 The bloodletting of the two veins that are after the ears is beneficial for ancient catarrhs, and for hemigraine (headache), and for scrofula (tuberculous swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck), and for old maladies of the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of bloodletting (it) is according to what I have said (in previous text).
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 And (it is) to shave the head of the sick person: and his back of the head should be rubbed in the place of two veins with a rough cloth rubbing well.

Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 And their places (are) after the ears, in two depressed places of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there mark it with a hot iron (branding).
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take the bloodletter (phlebotomist) with a cutting instrument (cultellus), and that one is called 'The One Who Cuts'.

Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place the sharp point that is at the top of the Fossory over the same vein, and strike it with a chisel or with something else in the same manner; and allow blood to flow according to the amount you desire.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then solve the wound of the sick person, and bind it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it is opened with a broad leech.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it should not be the sharp-edged leech, as the other leeches, but rather the broad-edged one.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the leech should be applied across (the wound) because the bone is nearby; and perhaps it will break when it is sharp.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 Chapter on the Phlebotomy of Veins in Two Lacrimal Ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 The remedy for the two veins that are in the two lacrimal ducts of the two eyes is for the eye affected by scabs and redness; it is applied to the eye itself, and to the diseases of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 And the quality of the leeching of these veins is that the sick person should bind his neck with a bandage.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then apply the leech to them; and you be standing over his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 And make the leeching across (the wound) to a length less than the width of the leech with a small leech and a broad one slightly smaller; because there is no flesh in that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 If the leech is sharp-edged, it may break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then let blood flow from the wound as much as is necessary for you.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 Place a piece of cloth over them and bind them overnight; and then unbind them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 Chapter on the Phlebotomy of the Nasal Veins.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 The veins of the nose are useful for treating acute fever, violent sore throat, diseases of the face such as headache and redness which occurs on the face; especially when it is chronic.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 The quality of phlebotomy in this case is to tighten the sick man's neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a fine, long phlebotomy needle; and fix it in the middle of his leper's snout, between that which distinguishes the nose according to its correct position.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Since the vein is not visible there and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 It is necessary that you hold your finger with the phlebotomy needle a little: and make the blood run according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then tie it up at night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it heals quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 Chapter on the Phlebotomy of Veins (Guidi).
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 Guidegi's two methods of phlebotomy are beneficial for the constriction of coughing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic diseases, and impetigo, as well as bad ulcers, and those that corrode, namely herpetic sores or scabies.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 The quality of the phlebotomy is to tighten a sick person under both necks with a band; and the worker stands above the head of the sick man, and the sick man sits on a chair.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then the vein is to be phlebotomized at a length slightly larger than the width of the phlebotomy needle.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then draw out an amount moderated or according to what you see, due to necessity for that purpose.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Do the same with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Then untie the band and tighten two veins with a constrictor; so that the sick man does not choke.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And release it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 A wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 Chapter on the Phlebotomy of Veins (Algeberich).
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 Algeberich's veins are beneficial for phlebotomy because they contribute to alcohol in the mouth, and decay of gums, as well as bad ulcers, fissures of the lips, ulcers, even those that are in the nose, and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 The quality of phlebotomy is that you make the sick person sit before you: and tie his neck with a bandage.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then roll back his lip, and look at the two veins: one is on the right side of the lip, and the second is on the left: and the demonstration of each is by the blackening of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And that is true: because around them are small, dark veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Therefore make an incision on each with a cutting incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 But if there is doubt about you and you do not know which one it is: then direct yourself to the larger incision, and that will be more obvious.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And similarly, do the same with the two veins that are on the upper lip: and certainly there is a common custom with it: and make an incision of the two veins that are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 [Paragraph on Phlebotomy of Sublingual Vein After Cephalic Phlebotomy.]
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 But of the two veins that are under the tongue, the help for phlebotomy is: because phlebotomy of the cephalic is for swellings that are in the throat, and sicknesses of the windpipe, and sicknesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person sits between your hands facing the sun: and clean his tongue, and look below the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein: and the color of each declines towards blackening.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Therefore phlebotomize both: and be careful not to injure your hand while phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For there are arteries beneath it, and perhaps there will be a flow of blood from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 [Paragraph on Three Veins in the Elbow.]
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow, are in whose phlebotomy a common custom runs in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And phlebotomy of these (things) is done according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 It can be done either by pricking with a broad-bladed leech (myrton): or by applying oil to the puncture for thinning: or by cutting with a sharp-edged lancet (cultellus), and this is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus Alnesil is what is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And among these (things) there are broad and thin forms according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The form of the leech (myrton) should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 It is suitable for opening hollow veins that are full, projecting, apparent, thick and those that contain thick, cloudy blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this leech (phlebotomus) is smaller in width and more delicate for thinning (extirpation).
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 It is suitable for the phlebotomy of fine veins that contain subtle, yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Chapter on basilica phlebotomy.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 The basilica vein (one of the three) is a help for phlebotomy (bloodletting).
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, because it follows the chest and abdomen; it is suitable for the leech (phlebotomator) when he performs phlebotomy on it, to be careful, and to beware of it since below it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If (the leech) therefore errs and adds in the puncture of the leech, he will cut the artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, the leech (phlebotomator) should not prick it with a leech: rather he should cut it with a lancet (Alnesil).
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the basilica is not apparent with a clear manifestation, then it should be sought out and exchanged for another or a branch of it should be sought: or if no branch is found, the leech (phlebotomus) can take the arm in its place.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 The matter is evident, and cut it with the leech Anesil, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If you wish to perform phlebotomy on the same, then it is necessary before tightening the arm, so that you touch the place, until you know the place of pulsation.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the place with pitch, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave knife by the leech Alnesil, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And beware that the blow does not fall into the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, while tightening the ligament, swelling at the place which you marked with pitch, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery; therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood springing up at the phlebotomy, like a boy's urine, and it is subtle, red: then you know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Therefore approach, and place your finger over the same space, afterwards remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If therefore blood is cut (many times it is cut), then tighten the arm and let it go; and beware the weak from moving it; let there be fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for some days, until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If however blood is not cut, and it beats you; and if medicine is not present to you at the moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its ends contract, and blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree, and fold it; take half of it, and tighten it over the place of vein tying, with a ligament and wool until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if blood is cut off, that is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if not [the case]: then care for the self with him to whom it preceded, the remembrance of the place from which powder-producing drainage flow is abscinding; and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the smallness of the wound's location, and the possibility of ligament from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 The Treatise on the Bleeding of the Dark Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 However, the bleeding of the dark vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, since it is composed of a branch of Basilica and a branch of Cephalica, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 Furthermore, it is suitable for the bloodletter to be cautious about it, since there is a nerve beneath it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 Therefore, if the bloodletter adds too much during the bleeding and finds a nerve, there results numbness, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps he will not recover completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to the sense of touch.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If it is concealed in some people and is subtle and does not show itself, then you must place your bleeding where you bleed her, with the incision of Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with all your might.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If the vein is between two nerves, then pierce the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 The Treatise on the Vein of the Head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 But the bleeding of the vein of the head is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and contributes to eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And it is suitable for this vein in particular, if you wish, that the bloodletter should anoint it with oil or myrtle while bleeding, since it is safer than all veins, because it is not beneath an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 It is appropriate for you in bloodletting that you ask the barber to take only the head of an arm, and seek a softer spot; it does not harm him if no such place is found at first strike, that you should repeat on it with bloodletting several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 Perhaps an abscess occurs in some people when they are not bled at the first strike, but it does not harm him that abscess.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 Chapter on the usefulness of bloodletting and precautions to be observed.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The nature and circumstances of bleeding, and those matters about which you should think for correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 Firstly, know that bleeding is not administered unless for the preservation of health and persistence thereof, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And bleeding should be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the radial (fusca), and the basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And bleeding should be done at the beginning of spring after fasting, during summer and autumn, and winter after eating when signs of filling appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 Bleeding should be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 However, bleeding administered in illnesses has no determined hour; but whenever it is necessary and appropriate for that purpose, it may be done at night or day, and in any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 It is not necessary to bleed children until they reach the age of fourteen.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 A pregnant woman should not be bled from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 The elderly who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 When someone wants to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that they clean their intestines with a mild enema before the bleeding if there is much retained feces in them; so that dirty, harmful fluids from the intestines do not attract veins at the time of bloodletting and harm the main organs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 The patient should not be bled when he is in a state of satiety or nausea: neither the drunkard, nor one coming out of drunkenness, until that (condition) has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 The sick man should not be with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 Care should be taken not to bleed again after a colic attack, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in sexual activity, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and any other thing that weakens the strength of the body or the animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider in detail about the fluids before that (bleeding), if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medications; if possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then enter a bath, if it does not forbid him something; or exercise in some way to make the blood thinner.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And put the bleeding of his in the chest, around the third day, as we said; and strive to make him expel his chest on that day from all animal ailments: such as suffocation, anger, fear; and from all bodily ailments, such as labor, punishment, excess, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him sit with the things that are in use by human custom for their aroma, scent, fragrance and similar things in quantity according to his ability.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the bleeder sit on a higher place than the bleeding couch; afterwards he shall draw his arm out and rub it with his own hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then tighten the bandage with a cord and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the bandage be moderate, because if the bandage is not equal or too tight in the binding, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after the ligature (stricture), it is necessary that the phlebotomist rubs his hands together simultaneously, until the veins swell, and they become apparent to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the phlebotomist cleanses (the instrument) for phlebotomy with a little oil, in an ancient and proper way.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then he places his index finger of the left hand on the same vein at the place where he wishes to do phlebotomy, barely: so that the vein does not escape and the blow is cushioned (absorbed).
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Since the veins are like strings fleeing during phlebotomy and from them is that which is full of windiness; and when you place the phlebotomizer upon it, it contracts under the phlebotomizer, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is ligated; therefore for this reason it is necessary that the phlebotomizer be firm and attentive in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then he places down (the instrument) the phlebotomizer.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If then a vein is opened from one side, it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then do it again on the other side in the same place barely or above it with haste; if the spot is not pierced through (repeatedly).
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If it is pierced through or frightened by the weak, then dismiss him for a day or two; and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps (the wound) will attract an abscess that is hot.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Do not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then repeat the phlebotomy, if it is loved (desired).
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small or the blood flows thinly; and be careful that the amount of blood which you wish does not escape from the blood; then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole according to correctness, and add slightly in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 Make it quickly before the location is removed, for the location to be removed is in many people during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If you see it already removed, then do not go over it at all, for nothing exempts you from it in your presence.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And place something made of oil over it: because it soothes the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 It is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 Similarly administer the ointment of oil in every phlebotomy of yours, where you let blood against the flow of blood: and they do it with Tyrian alfarach, and sageza, when one of them is placed over the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 Blood becomes subtle and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If it happens in the place of phlebotomy a large abscess, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except on that occasion, or it is a small opening of a vein, then hurry and place over the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly: and tie it for an hour: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 It is necessary that you do this after the blood has come out from the vein itself, when it has completed its flow, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something remains in the place after several days that is black or greenish, it does not harm it: and if you wish, place over it something of aloe, or myrrh dissolved; or something from the juice of mint, that is, calaminthe or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And indeed abscesses and protrusions often occur in the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Therefore place your hand over it, then if you find softness under your pressure on it, then that protrusion is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Carefully place something from what I said upon it.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 Perhaps blood from the artery will flow out of it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 Make an ointment for it with that which has styptics, so that it may harden the place.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 It is necessary to draw blood from every man according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears as a boil on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 If the blood is black, then let it come out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it come out until it becomes more subtle; and similarly if it is sharp, let it be removed until its sharpness disappears.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 It is necessary for the one who is full and strong, and needs to have blood drawn once, that the vein cutting be amplified; and let him be a vein cutter with one side; and it should be opposite for the one who is weak.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 It is necessary to draw it out in veins and that the hole be tight; and it is better when administered in vein cutting that it be a cross section, not a prick.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 This method of vein cutting is safe from the flow of blood and from the cut of a nerve; it is more praiseworthy and safer than vein cutting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And whoever is accustomed to come for vein cutting with fainting, it is necessary that he eat a little bread soaked in water of grape-juice or sekanjabin if he is heated; and draw blood from him in three or four veins.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 If she is of cold constitution, then let her take before vein cutting bread soaked in syrup of honey, or in syrup of aromatized honey with spices, or in fragrant aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If bleeding occurs during phlebotomy (bloodletting) and it is caused by excessive blood flow, then one should take meat water and fragrant syrup of subtle strength, and use aromatics with alum, and apply linen to the chest with it; and use the rest as mentioned in the division on syncope from the chapter on evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 If one wants to empty his arm and let out blood, and the phlebotomy is due to a large evacuation and its strength is weak, then he should let out the blood gradually by the amount of its strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But if one wants to empty his arm and let out blood, and his body is probably: then he should do this after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 If one wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it inclines, then it should be done on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In a body where much blood has already become heated and sharpened, and it makes fever occur: it is necessary for the blood to be expelled from him once, and a large quantity to be drawn out; and the opening should be enlarged until syncope occurs; after you have observed all conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on the pulse of his arm along the course of the blood, so as not for death to occur due to syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 For it often occurs when the phlebotomist is unaware, and it falls through negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 And it is not necessary when you want to empty the arm and let out blood on the second day, if the opening of the vein is already closed, and the outflow of blood becomes difficult, to press upon it with violence and to stretch it quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 That is very bad, rather let it be, until it is bled a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Remove with the sharpness of the lancet that which has clotted from the blood in the vein's opening, and place something dissolved in salt water upon it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And place upon it some turban or alfaroch, or saffron, and apply gentle pressure until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 If it is already a vein that has been cut, then let it be, and do not cover it up, until the abscess settles down.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If there is a need to let out blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either make an incision over the same place or in another vein of the arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The arm's vein is bled at the place of the Fuscus and Basilicus, as they are not found and are hidden because they are composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 The quality of bleeding is such that a weak hand is inserted into hot water until it turns red and the vein appears clearly manifest.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then bind it above with a string of moderate tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then bleed it again by transverse incision slowly, neither wide nor long; and let the opening be wide, and let your bleeding there on the joint of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If the outflow of blood is prevented, then dip your hand into hot water and let the blood run into the water until you meet your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 But if it is during the days of summer, then you are excused from dipping your hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 It is indeed recommended that the course of blood be let in hot water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 This vein's bleeding is safer than all other veins because there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 Phlebotomy of the right hand (Salvatella) is for the afflictions of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the quality of its phlebotomy is that you tie the little finger of the hand with a ligature or your hand after inserting it into warm water until the vein becomes inflamed and it is clearly felt.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then make an incision across (it).
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And preserve (it), lest you cut off your hand with the phlebotomy instrument.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under it are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then put your hand again into warm water and let blood flow there.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood will clot in the vein opening and stop flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 Therefore when you extract from the blood a quantity necessary, then put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not clot quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And likewise it is necessary that you do this with every constricted vein.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 But the aid of this phlebotomy is from the left hand, because it is for the afflictions of the spleen; and do likewise with its phlebotomy as you did with the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 And the aid of the saphenous vein phlebotomy is for the afflictions that are in the lower part of the body, such as the afflictions of the womb, retention of menstruation, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs and similar afflictions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the quality of its phlebotomy is that an afflicted person puts his foot into warm water; and he should do rubbing on it until the veins swell up, and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The location of the vein is near the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and many branches originate from it on the sole of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 The vein therefore should be tapped in a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its cluster; because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If the vein is to be tapped on the sole of the foot, then take care not to touch the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 Place your lancet for tapping the vein at an angle across it, as if you wish to cut into it; and let the one who taps the vein be called Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If the flow of blood is prohibited, then immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood run out into it until it has emptied.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the vein is accidentally missed by the one who taps in the first instance, then let him repeat with the lancet towards the upper part, for it is a safer place, and there is no danger of harm, provided you take care to avoid the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 Similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the Sciatic vein, as we have said, is near the heel on the side of the woods.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 The aid for tapping this vein is to relieve pain in the ankle when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 The quality of the tapping is that an unwell person should enter the bath and hurry; and tie his leg from the side of the ankle up to the heel with a long, fine bandage; for it will not appear unless for this reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears, then tap the vein in whatever way your ability allows, either across or at an angle; and it is better to cut into it with a cut or to sever it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 The location [of it] is healthy, and it is very much hidden in many men.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find [it] and it does not appear to the senses at all: then prick some branch of it, and there is one that appears on the back of the foot, turned towards the ear; and beware of nerves, and let a quantity of blood flow as much as you want.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then loosen the ligature, and place the skin over the pricking site, and tighten the spot.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 Indeed, it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 [Section on] Venesection, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 [They are made from] Corners, and copper, and glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And venesection is done according to two modes.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With scarification and the drawing of blood; and the other is venesection without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this [form of] venesection that is without scarification, is according to two modes.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the places for venesection with scarification and drawing of blood on the body are fourteen.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One of them is the venesection of Alnocrates, and it is at the end of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the venesections of Alhagdahim, and they are two blades of the neck from both sides simultaneously; and the venesection of the brain, and it is under the lower jaw; and the venesections of two spoons; and the venesection of Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the venesections of two kidneys, and they are in the middle of the arms; and the venesections of the legs; and the venesections of the ankles.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And venesection does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of this its power is not drawn out from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary to administer ventosation (ventosection) with or without fire, until the entire body has evacuated, in any ailment caused by retention.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity requires ventosation due to an ailment or custom, we administer it at the beginning, end, and middle of each month, as well as at any time it may be required.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 That is, because from some people there arises an excess of blood, until it requires extraction through ventosation, a pain and headache are found in the head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And among them is one who finds retention and redness on his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among them is one who finds itchiness on his face and forehead, as well as darkness and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And among them is one who scratches the site of his ventosation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or the tongue protrudes and spits out the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And among them is one who sees in his sleep blood and redness, as well as the dead, wounds, and similar things.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we therefore see something from among these, especially if it is in the middle of the third month: we then prescribe ventosation to be done, after two or three hours have passed since that day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The benefit of ventosation for the neck is that it relieves pressure in the head and that which is drained goes to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 However, it must be done after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And this ventosation is in place of cephalic phlebotomy (venesection).
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 It is not allowed to use it who is of a cold temperament, or where there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 It causes him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 Therefore, it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, and where there are cold diseases of the head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 He who becomes constant over it generates forgetfulness in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 Therefore, you must instruct the ventilator to lower his hand with the wind for a short while towards the bottom, fearing the production of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Ventilation or Alkehel is in place of phlebotomy for Fuscus, and phlebotomy for Basilica, and therefore it produces coughing, constriction of breath, shortness of breath due to the instrument, coughing, and filling (of the body).
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 It must be forced to ventilate Alkehel briefly, because if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and the stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 But ventilation of alhagdahim causes accidents of pain in the head, migraines, and hemigranes (half-headaches), perforation (of a body part), and pain in the roots of the teeth: it is in place of phlebotomy for Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, you must instruct the ventilator not to press his hand during scarification, so as not to cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 But ventilation under the chin causes alcohol in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar conditions which are in the mouth, and takes the place of phlebotomy elsewhere which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 But ventilation with spatulas causes a condition called alchafacham, which comes from compression and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 But ventilation of the internal parts of the two fists causes help for phlebotomy of the veins of three (types), Basilica, Fuscus and Cephalicus: because it draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh; and these small veins draw blood from other larger ones until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 It is necessary that you advise the Scarifier not to proceed too much in scarifying: because the place is bare of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 The one who is ventosed on the anus, relieves hemorrhoids of the anus, and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 It is necessary that you advise the one who performs ventosing, that the ventose should be large and made of air: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps delicate ventoses may break; and it shall be scarified by a deep scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 Ventoses of the legs decrease with a clear reduction: because they draw blood from the whole body, and bring about old pains in the kidneys, and uterus, and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and bring forth water retention and abdominal dropsy: and they stand where phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 Nevertheless, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 The help of the ventose used in alhorcobeni is close to the help of the ventoses of the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the positioning of the ventose is that you place the ventose first in a void area, and apply suction moderately: and do not prolong the positioning of the ventose, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the place equally: and do not cease from repeating this and continuing until you see the place redden and swell, and redness of blood appears: then scarify, and perform suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in positioning of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For one who is among humans of tender flesh and few pores, it is necessary to scarify him once, not more: so that the place does not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And command the Wind-Letter (Ventosatori) to enlarge the incision and shallow it slightly; and temper the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is thickening in the blood, then it is necessary to incise it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In the first instance, an opening is made for subtle blood flow and its moisture; in the second instance, during the careful examination of deep blood extraction, thick blood is extracted.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If indeed the blood is extremely fetid, then an incision should be made for the third time, following it to the end.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And finally, when we wish to extract blood slowly or a little at a time, one incision is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we wish to extract much blood, then we should make multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make a deep incision; and the end of the incision is equal to its depth.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 \*\*What is that which should be administered from oils in the position of Wind-Letter, and what should be cautious in wind-dressing.\*\*
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In the case where the skin is thick, hard, dark, and the pores are tight, it is necessary to anoint the wind-letter areas with open, lenitive, and resolvent oils; if it is during summertime, as is alkali oil, or oil of wormwood, or sweet almond oil, or oil from the seed of a squash.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is during wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or vinegar are used; and similar to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If there is excessive thickening and coldness, then bitter almond oil, or balm oil, or white oil, or anise oil are used; and similar to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If a wind-disease is widespread in large pores, of tender flesh: then it is necessary that oil be prohibited, and it is necessary that they clean the places of the wind after the wind-disease treatment with rose water, or with cold water, or with sea water, or with cucumber water, or with purslane water: and similar to these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 For the one whose blood is much moisture, clean wind-diseased places with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and sumac: and similar to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 For the one who has excessive thick ones, clean wind-diseased places with old wine, or with juniper water, or with dill boil, or chamomile: and similar to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 And it is necessary to avoid wind-disease treatment in a bath or near a bath, rather it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And it is not necessary that anyone sleeps after wind-disease treatment.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 § What is it that is necessary to control Wind-disease or Phlebotomata before wind-disease treatment.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that, it is necessary to consider first: then if the one who has wind-disease or phlebotomata is choleric and its sharpness and inflammation prevails over his blood: then it is necessary for him to receive cooling agents, such as grapes in honey; also oil of endive with vinegar and lettuce, and boiled leek and yolk; and similar to these.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And place his food as pullets, cooked mutton meat, and foods stored with vinegar: and similar to these.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 And for the one whose complexion is cold, it is necessary to drink syrup from honey or almug or boiled leek seed: and drink moderately fragrant wine that is between old and new; and it is ordered to use sparingly food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 Place his food with young birds, and let them warm it: and small birds, that is to say, little birds: and the young of doves shall be warmed.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 It is necessary that on the day of ventositation and phlebotomy there be more drink than food: it is necessary to give in drink some people during Tyrian hours, or medicine made from musk, that is, muscatel, or alesselith before ventosation; and before or after phlebotomy, so that the main limbs are strengthened, and the blood becomes thin.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 It is not necessary to drink it in hot liquids.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Chapter on ventositation without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Ventosations that are without scarification are those placed on the liver, spleen, podagra, stomach, navel, places of kidneys, and the ankle pit: because these members do not allow scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 Nor does it seek through these, except the attraction of blood from one member to another; as we place ventosation on the breasts in the sickness of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 We make use of them to remove cold and offensive ventositation from one member by another; as we place ventosation on the stomach, and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it rarefies the member, heats it up, and removes pain for that reason, because it has resolved that ventositation.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Also placed over the kidneys when there is pus or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 For by its virtue, perhaps it opens up pus, or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly when placed over the liver and spleen for the purpose of bleeding in both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 These ventosations are administered empty with incision only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are administered with warm water in the afflictions of pleurisy: and this is to be filled with a Ventose, and it should be large, hot water alone, or water in which herbs that agree have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 Form of the ventose administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 Let the width of its opening be two fingers wide, as we have formed it; and let its depth be half a palm; and let there be on its side, in a place about halfway along it, a small hole, according to the size that the needle can enter; make it from brass or citron wood, with the edges rounded, equal, and smoothed; so as not to hurt the limb when placed upon it; and let there be in the middle of it a crossbar transverse from brass or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this ventose is made large, larger than we have said, but not much smaller than it, according to the afflictions and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For the ventoses of boys and those wasted are other than the ventoses of men and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this ventose with fire upon a limb is to light a linen cloth with fire properly, or a small candle from tallow; and place it on the middle crossbar that is in the middle of the ventose; so that the fire may be lit about half-way down the ventose, so as not to burn the body of the sick person.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then it is placed upon a limb; and the finger should be on the hole that I said, until we hold the ventose; while we need it, let us remove the finger, and steam will come out through the hole, and the ventose will immediately break.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then, linen cloth according to its kind, and heat it if necessary.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 In pneumothorax that is administered in the case of pleurisy with water, there is no bladder or hole; it is not administered except because it is filled with water and placed only on the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And this pneumothorax, as it is larger, to take in more water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 \ paragraph on Suspension of Sugar of Lead.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Sanguisugae are not administered in many cases, unless in those members where the position of the ventous sacs is not possible due to their small size, such as lips, gums, and similar places.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or in the naked member devoid of flesh, such as fingers, nose, and similar places.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of using them is that you come from the Sanguisuga which are in sweet, clean waters free of decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they should be placed day and night in sweet water until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then the body is bled first with phlebotomy, and with ventosus.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then cleanse the sick member until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Then they are placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are filled and fall, and there is a possibility of squeezing the place with the ventous sac, then it is more helpful for relief; and if not, then cleanse the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then with much water, rub and squeeze.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the course of the blood is prolonged after the removal of the Sanguisuga and it persists, then soak a piece of linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the perspiration disappears.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood is multiplied, then on it powderize zeugite crushed or gall-like substances from styptics, until the blood is cut off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or powders made from halved and peeled beans may be placed on the location, and left until the beans stick to the spot, for the blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And if it is necessary to repeat the application of Sanguisugars, when possible, they should be changed.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 But if Sanguisugars are forbidden from suspension, then the location should be cleaned with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or insert a lancet into the locations until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then they are placed, for when they feel something from the blood, they will stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you wish for them to fall, powderize something from crushed aloes, or salt, or ashes on them; and they will fall immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 § Universal Discourse on Restoring, Dislocating, and Treating Twisting and Similar Conditions.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know ye, O sons, that foolish physicians and the common people boast about this chapter, and those who have never examined an ancient book nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, the method is deprived of knowledgeable people in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never encountered this method in any good way, and I was not proficient in it unless through the length of reading ancient books and my interest in understanding them, until I extracted knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I affix with experiment and study to the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 I have now described for you all that contains my knowledge from that chapter, and whatever exceeded my experience, since I abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it to the end of abbreviation, and displayed it at the end of decline; and I have formed many shapes in it from the shapes of instruments used in it, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 The total and the collections from the fractures of bones, from those whose removal is necessary before we begin to recall the members broken and diverse, if any one of them.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary to say at the beginning of this chapter the sum of speech and the headings, to which understanding is first required for the craftsman to his station regarding their truth; namely that you and those who are quick may know or learn this noble art from you, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say therefore that when fracture, dislocation, twist or fall occurs to someone, then it is necessary that you quickly go to him for bloodletting and resolving, or both at once; if not prohibited by something like weakness of strength; or he to whom this happens is a child, or old and decrepit; or the time is very hot or very cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, beans and heads; and prohibit wine, thick meats, and filling of foods and every food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until you are secure from a hot fever and do not fear effusion of matter to the limb; then let the weak return to his own regimen first, with which his accustomed practice was.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the broken bone begins to heal, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing food in abundance, thick, heavy, in which there is viscosity; such as food made from cooked wheat with water, rice, and heads, feet, and entrails of cattle, eggs, and fresh fish; also thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 With this regimen, the healing of the fracture occurs more quickly, and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that the bones fractured in men who are in the first old age and worn out, it is not possible for them to be joined together and healed according to their nature always, because of the drying up of their limbs; they are consolidated and joined together which come from those at the end of softness, like the bones of small boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Nevertheless, nature connects something similar to glue around the broken bone from all sides, which has thickness, so that it adheres and tightens it until they are consolidated on both sides, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, until it does not prohibit anything from its operations; and for this reason it is necessary to put nourishment for the sick man, which has thickness, viscosity, and heaviness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs; since a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head of the bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the backbone; and similarly all other limbs exist differently from one another; and I come with the reminder of every type of fracture exposed in its own chapter distinguished from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 The species of bone fracture are diversified even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Since the fracture of it is arched, furthermore stars occur in it. (Stars here refer to protrusions or irregularities in the broken bone.)
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes the fracture of it occurs along the length of the bone; and there are fractures called star-shaped, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as in a reed when it is cut with a knife to write. (Here, the analogy suggests that the fractured bone has protrusions like the fibers in a reed when it's cut.)
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not proceeding; and there is a fracture with a wound and splitting at the head; and there is a small split fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every species has a skill or proper tool for its restoration according to its recollection, which is distinguished in its respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from that which the bone fracture is known, there is its crookedness, and its elevation; and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand. (Here, the description implies that a fractured bone may have an irregular shape, elevated edges, be visible or palpable, and produce a sound upon compression.)
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When therefore there is no apparent crookedness in its location, nor a sound when you touch the bone with movement, nor does it find a weak great pain; then there is no fracture there, indeed it may be that it is a crookedness or a small split; therefore, you should not move it with your hand and compression altogether, instead place it on top of some medicine whose recollection comes to mind, after the appropriate time; then it is tied down gently. (Here, the advice suggests that if there's no apparent crookedness, sound upon touch or strong pain in a particular area, then it may not be a fracture. In such cases, the bone should be left undisturbed and treated with suitable medicine.)
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that when a place arches and splits into two, furthermore stars occur in it, yet all parts are removed from their comparison; then it is necessary for you to begin at your hour for its correction, aligning it before an abscess of hot pus occurs on it. (This passage suggests that if a fracture splits into two and shows star-shaped protrusions, all the parts should be aligned for correction to prevent an abscess of hot pus from forming.)
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If however a boil occurs warm, then let it be left for some days until the boil subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then equal it accordingly to whatever method is possible by gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than a bone, in which fractures occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then bind it, according to when you will remember it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If however there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from both parts, if it is a hand or foot: or with your hand, if the part is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 Let your position be such that you place the member on a level surface according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try, by any means possible, to make those additions return, and in their places: and be careful according to your strength, lest pain or injury occurs due to your operation. And try according to your strength, to apply one of two bones with its companion, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 It is necessary at that hour that you test and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If therefore you see something abnormal there, correct it and equal it out according to the quantity of your power.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For often they cause boils to occur by their operation, or contraction in a limb: as we have already seen this many times from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then connect after the equalization and proper operation, and tightening of that limb, and peace, and calmness: and warn the weak against it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 Make him take care that he does not move himself during the hours of his vigil, and during the revolutions of his sleep, and during his agitation, and during his digestion, and all his movements with utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 Make him take care that there is no position of the limb which follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 This is because when he feels pain or injury in the position of a limb, then it is necessary to change him to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And be careful that his position is equal and straight; so that there is no twisting in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 The quality of the binding of a broken limb is as I have told.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that broken limbs are classified according to their smallness, size, and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Those which are small, such as the arm, the finger, the wrist and similar ones, then it is necessary that there be a soft, fine wrapping of cloth around them.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 Those which are large, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary that there be a wide, hard wrapping around them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Because a broad binding connects a large limb and binds it from all sides with an equal pressure so that no spot is left uncovered.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then after your evacuation, begin to place the appropriate ointment on it on a soft woolen cloth over the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin to wrap the binding over the site of the fracture three or four times, according to how deserving the limb is; and tighten your hand slightly with the binding.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then go with him to the upper part above the site of the fracture and tighten it less than your previous binding which you had bound the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then stretch yourself slightly with a gentle pulling away from the location of the fracture, and gradually soften the stiffness, until you can grasp a large amount from a healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another poultice and apply it again over the fractured location with more layers.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Afterwards, go down with the poultice to the lower part below the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your work be in the stiffness of the poultice and its softening, according to what was said in the first layer of poultice application.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place soft materials such as wool or cloth between the poultice layers to match the curvature of the fracture, if there is a curvature; and if not, do not put anything in that area.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then apply another layer of poultice over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then place evenly arranged stars (small elevations) immediately on top of these poultice layers if there is no swelling or warm abscess in that area.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 But if there is swelling or an abscess there: then place on it what sits the abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then bind tightly the evenly arranged stars (small elevations).
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 Let the small elevations be made from pieces of wide reeds that have been shaved and shaped wisely; or let them be made of wood from which cribra (cobble-stones) are made, such as pine or yew, or calingi (small wooden balls); and let the width of each elevation be in this shape and this same form.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, the elevation that is placed on the fracture should be slightly larger and wider than the others; and the length of the elevation should be according to what is allowed by the size and smallness of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then bind tightly over the elevations with another layer of poultice, according to the first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind above with threads properly, as we have said concerning the stricture: and it is that your stricture be over the place of the fracture more: and as it is more elongated from the fracture, the stricture is smaller.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 It is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and they should be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 Since if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operation of foolish people putting their threads made from twisted cords of rough linen, it is a great mistake: because the stricture falls with them beyond its quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And again, fine threads do not suit: since you will not achieve with the stricture what you desire with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger between one astel and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If a sick person is injured by the extremities of the astels after the stricture in healthy places: then place under them from soft wool or camel's hair wool until nothing is injured from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 But when there is a fracture with a wound, and it happens that the disruption occurs in the skin, I will come again with its reminder in the second chapter regarding its uniqueness.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every fractured limb needs to be bound with astels from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 Because a limb that is large should not have upper astels placed on it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the onset of the hot swelling.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 This is the method of plasters, which the ancients used, that are placed over a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 § Common emplaster method abbreviated, restoring the fracture, suitable for various temperaments, especially women and children: since it is from that which heat does not conquer nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is to receive from the flour mill dust and it is the marrow of the flour that hangs on the walls of the mill next to the millstone movement; and make it as it is, except that you sieve it with egg white: and place its preparation not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another method for emplaster is for healing a fracture, and dislocation, and a twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Make almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath: and macerate all of them in ten parts of myrrh, and five parts each of aloes, and twenty parts of alethil: grind all of them and sift, and mix with water of alethil; or with cow's milk, if the bandage of the sick person is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this emplaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is of good composition, heals quickly broken bones and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method for emplaster also benefits a fracture and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Make mugath, mess, white alteae, all of them in ten parts of myrrh, and five parts each of aloes, and six parts of acacia, twenty parts of Armenian pounded bolus: grind all of them with much grinding, sift, and make with water or cow's milk: and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method for emplaster for joining together, and separated bones from their places: and eases the pain that happens to them, and splitting of the bone, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take boiled wool, immerse it in vinegar and boiled oil: and place it on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 And indeed, there is no virtue of healing in this emplaster, but it is good for the soothing of a hot abscess: and it expels pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Another method for emplaster that heals a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take leaves of the deaf fig tree and wild papaver leaves: grind all of them, and make an emplaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Another short method for emplaster, administered for healing a broken bone: and when you wish the dissolution of a remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Prepare a root of althea (Marshmallow), chamomile, flowers of violets, and a portion of the herb flour - all in equal parts: grind them all and make a paste with wine, unless the member is heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is heated, then make paste with water of coriander (Coriander) seeds or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another stronger plaster method for resolving a hard fistula when restoring a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Prepare a root of althea (Marshmallow), flax seeds, boxwood, lentil, henna, wormwood, flowers of violets, and chamomile - all in equal parts: grind them all and make a paste with water of willow, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Apply the whole thing according to the member's warmth and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that it should be placed on a fractured member during its restoration, unless it is made of pitch and oil; nothing else; he said it should be of medium thickness between coarseness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galenus, however, thought that these substances with the extraction of heat should be placed on a fractured member during its restoration, such as myrrh, aloes, frankincense, and similar things from what we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Another plaster method that heals injuries and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Prepare milled (or very finely ground) figs, chickpeas, hair of man or feathers of bird, althea (Marshmallow), and salt - all in equal parts: grind them, sift them, and make a paste; then make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity of the bandage that should remain according to which it is necessary, then it is loosened, should be considered when there is no weak pain, itching, or moving of the fractured bone from its place; then do not loosen it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If it happens to him at a place itching strongly, or distressing pain, or swelling: then hurry and dissolve (the plaster) in an hour of that (affected part), and remove the plaster from him: and take soft cloth or sea sponge, moist: and immerse it in warm water, and clean the place with it until the itching subsides, and the pain is relieved.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then allow the member to rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place over it soft wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind over it at night until you are secure from hot inflammation, and the swelling of the member subsides, and the pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then repeatedly apply to it a narrow bandage and small plaster: and do not bind (it) with your first constriction and fine ones until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling and all the other symptoms have been completely removed: and you require plaster and bandage, then repeat this as you did in the first place equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing of what we said happens to the member: then do not dissolve (the plaster) before three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is released for 20 days according to what appears to you from the dissolution of the member, as we said, until when a fracture adheres and coagulation of flesh on it: add also in the bandage more than your first bandage completely: and add also in the thickening of food according to what was mentioned before its recall.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you see the place of the fracture already dry out and become thinner than necessary: then know that nutrition is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Dissolve it (the embrocation) with warm water at every place where you apply it, and let it be in all three days, and it will slightly relieve the stricture.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 Through this procedure, nourishment flows to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 What the foolish restorers do in place of a fractured member, when it is not restored as required, and they restore it according to its curvature, is an error due to their procedure, and there is great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said so in their books, and they would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I have never seen any trace of theirs in this at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 Chapter on the making of an incision in the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 Types of fractures are diverse, and their shapes are many; and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For from a fracture is one that occurs by striking with a sword; and the strike removes bone completely up to the point where it reaches the siphac (a ligament beneath the skull), just as an ax does in wood, and for this reason this type of fracture is called "Axial".
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the sword strikes some bone and cuts its surface but does not penetrate through the incision to the end; and this type of fracture is called "Kalan", that is, an Absolute Lever.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And a wound can be either of two types of fractures, large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from a fracture is one that is a crushing or rubbing; and its cause is a blow with a stone, a fall onto a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture is also one that penetrates, which is close to the panniculus (a layer beneath the skull), or it is on the surface of the bone; and this wound can be either of two types of fractures, large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And from a fracture is one which is hidden within the bone at the subtlety of the hair; and it is a small crack, and for this reason this type of fracture is called capillary fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And there is a fracture which occurs by accident or striking with a stone, and similar things that cause a layer of the bone to enter within, making a hollow place; as happens to anvils when struck, and part of them enters within.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 Indeed it happens most often in the wet bones of skulls, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And there are all these kinds of separating fractures, and I will mention them with the whole thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 We recognize all these kinds of fractures by examination on it and investigation of them with probing tools, and removal of corrupted flesh that is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The capillary type is recognized by this, that it appears on the bone and is scraped off, and it is limited with an encaustic iron; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of fractures, consider first the condition of the patient; if you see signs from his condition that are clearly indicative of fear, such as vomiting choler, extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, discharge of the eyes, redness of them, and similar things among various conditions, it will probably not heal; and if you see signs that do not frighten you, and hope for recovery; then begin the treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 If a wounded man comes to you first with his wound; and this is during the days of winter, then it is necessary that you strive in bone removal before the 14th day according to all conditions.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 If it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it corrupts what is under the bone from the fat, and such accidents as I have mentioned occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the fracture of a bone has already reached the fat touching the brain and it is accompanied by small pieces and traction, then it is necessary that you cut the fragmented and smoothed part, as I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is necessary to shave the head of the wounded and to dig into the bone according to whatever method is possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound and what is light on what is weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If while digging into the bone there occurs a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then apply what is necessary to it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is necessary to fill the place with soaked rags in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess settles, and be secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin in the healing of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 The first method is to cut the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then administer another chisel wider than the previous one: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then administer yet another chisel even wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is to have a number of chisels of different sizes among you, some wider than others, and some shorter than others: and they should be at the end of sharpness, and made of iron or steel, and use them with ease when striking the chisel so as not to strike the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the bone is hard and firm, then it is necessary that you bore around its circumference before you administer Incisoria, with Terebris which are named Terebra not penetrating too deep: and they are not called so unless because themselves do not pass beyond the bone's meaty limit to what is beyond it; therefore, because the Terebrum has a rounded extremity above that which is under its head and is sharp, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents immersion, and passing through the bone's thickness.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 It is necessary for you to take a large number of Terebris from these, each one of which should correspond to the thickness of the bone, until you have all the Terebrum for that bone: whose sharp extremity's length and width should be in accordance with the thickness of that bone.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the shape of three kinds of Terebrums or Trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of boring around the bone's circumference when it is broken, is: that you place the Terebrum on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the Terebrum to another place and put what is between every hole of that quantity or approximately.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with Incisoria what is between every hole of the bone: and make it as fine as possible on its edge, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with certain instruments which you have prepared for that purpose, such as tenaliae and delicate forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary to avoid all caution so that the Terebrum or Incisoria does not touch any part of the siphac.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you are boring around the bone and it is separated from the siphac, if it is continuous with it and you extract it, then it is necessary that you grind and level its remaining extremity in the bone with another similar instrument like an Incisoria.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 It is necessary that it [the instrument] be thin and delicate more than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something remains from the small bones and cartilage: then take it with ease, with that which is at hand from your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound after that with linen cloths and ointments as we said before.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 And another method of operation is easy and entirely far from fear; which Galen said and praised greatly; and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 It is necessary for you first to begin to expose the bone part from the place where the fracture is more violent and more apparent; until when you have exposed that part and placed under it the extreme end of this convex incisor, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the convex part, the convex does not cut anything; and the sharp part of it in its two sides going in length as you see: so that the convex part is attached to the ulna, with the sharp part incident on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike upon the convexor with a small hammer until you incise the whole bone with ease, as it is revolved; and be careful that no cloth slips into what happens to slip which you fear completely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the physician were not more foolish than men, and less ignorant of his craft, nor sleeping, then if something remained attached to the bone from a cloth in some places, he would cut it off with the extreme end of the convex incisor and free it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the cloth and what is cut off from the bone is the face of it, and roughness and delicate cartilage remain in it: then it is necessary that you smooth down the roughness, and remove the delicate cartilage with subtle rasps which you have prepared in various quantities, so that it is possible for you to apply them more conveniently and correctly in every place according to what leads you the operation, and the fractured bone, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And it is necessary that you administer, according to your own judgment, first of all cutting the bone, more widely with those larger saws.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease doing it continuously until you reach the point of administering thinner and finer [things], and subtler than all those [other things].
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In each of the remaining small cracks and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care, according to that which leads to the correction of [them].
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And there is a matter which is not hidden over all, to whichever pursuit this art has been devoted, and it stands upon that which we have written and shown concerning large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If, however, a piece of cloth is detected and retained when you are removing the bone: then it is necessary that you take linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and dip it into rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another double or triple piece of cloth, and dip it into wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do this as easily as possible above it, so that it is not heavy.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer over it a broad bandage: and do not tighten it unless by the amount which holds the wound only: and release it with this care for one day or two days, until you are secure from hot infection.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it and administer afterwards medicines with which excess dryness is needed: such as the roots of the garlic, and the flour of herbs, and sandalwood powder, and aristolochia, and similar [substances]: and there is that you make from these medicines a powder, which is to be sprinkled over the wound like dry ones.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And universally administer all medicine for the property of which it is for cleansing and not biting.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 Avoid, according to your skill, that the wound during your treatment is clean: neither be there in it dirt from ointment, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Do not allow pus to collect at all on it because when pus accumulates on a cerebral padding, it corrupts it and makes it rot, and after that it brings about great harm for the sick person: and already it has happened on the skull-bone, when the bone is being cleaned by him, especially when the care of it is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Then if the accidents that I have mentioned happen to the sick person, know that it is certainly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if blackness does not appear except from the medicine that is applied to it and the medicine has this property to make it black: then you must take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and anoint it with these.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on the skull-bone: afterwards take care of it with suitable means of healing until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 Restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose is not broken except for two of its upper parts at once, or one of them: because there are two bones in it; since below it is cartilaginous, it does not break and it does not happen to it unless there is rubbing, and twisting, and curvature.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of its two parts is broken, then you must insert a small finger into the nostril and hold the broken part with your index finger and thumb on the outside until the nose returns to its natural shape; this should be done skillfully with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And take care that pain does not happen to the sick person during your treatment.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it does not reach that with the finger: then it is necessary that the end of the radius should be equalized, where there is a small swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture occurs in two parts, then make it similar to that one: and approach with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day at a place of warm fumigation.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a piece of linen from a linen cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two pieces of linen if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be a swelling of such size in the linen that it fills the nostril opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some of the old restorers said to immerse the linen pieces in butter and change them every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 But I do not see this, rather it is necessary that the linen piece should be immersed in egg white, prepared with miller's flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then release the linen, until the bone hardens and the cartilage thickens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose where the linen was, after soft cloth has been placed on top of it; and this holds the nasal fracture more strongly, so that a sick person may not be prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you wish, do it; and if you wish, do with the linen pieces.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If the nose happens to develop a wound while operating on a warm fumigation, apply nasal plasters with tar, or with pitch softened in rose oil, or a little bit of alkali.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if no warm fumigation occurs, then it is necessary that the plasters be applied with camel's flour and incense powder mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft cloth upon him (the patient), and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If the bones of the nose are broken and fractured in a small way or crushed, then it is necessary that you cut open and extract them with suitable instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then suture it (the wound), and take care of him with whatever that promotes healing, and consolidates it from suitable ointments or plasters for that purpose.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If there is a wound in the nose, then it is necessary that you take care of him with linen cloths: and administer a leaden cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Chapter on Restoring the Lower Jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is broken and there is no wound associated with it, then examine whether its breakage is only on the outside and it is not fractured into two and curves towards the inside: in such a case, its diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if the breakage is on the right side, insert your left index finger into the patient's jaw: similarly, if the breakage is in the left jaw, then insert your right index finger: and push with it the curvature of the fracture towards the outside with ease using your other hand from the inner part of the bone correctly, and with equal force on the same side.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the broken jaw is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer an extension from both sides according to straightness: until it is possible for them to be aligned equally.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If there has already been movement or disruption of the teeth, then tie together those that you hope will remain with a gold wire, silver wire, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place a soft cloth over the broken jaw (mandible).
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place on top of him a double cloth, and place upon the cloth a well-made large pin or an equal piece of shoelather along the length of the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind him above as you prepare his bandage and its application suits him until it does not break down; and instruct the sick one to rest peacefully and quietly; and place soft food for his loosening diet.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If you find that something has changed in his shape in any way: then hasten and cut him open on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has been distorted from it, and plaster him with flour of mill, with egg white or wheat flour after you have removed the purulent matter; and place a soft woolen cloth on top of the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While the aforementioned plaster remains on him and the bone arrangement does not change, leave him as he is, without cutting, until he is healed; or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 For this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then administer what I said many times for its reduction until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if there is a fracture with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 If the fractured part is separated from the bone or cartilage: then be subtle in this matter, so that you remove those fragments of cartilage with what suits you in their removal using tools.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If the wound opening is narrow: then widen it with a leech according to the quantity required by you.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you remove the cartilage and there is nothing left of it, or if the wound opening is wide: and if it is not, place on top of it an appropriate plaster and let it heal until healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 On the restoration of a fractured crossbar (Furcula).
Caput VI.	 Title VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 The crossbar (Furcula) is most frequently broken from the front part near the humerus, and its fracture occurs in one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Or it is broken into two pieces beyond which there occur protrusions; and this is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or thus, when the protrusion occurs in the bone itself; and this is more difficult for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or it is broken with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation in this case, when there is no wound, consists of making two assistants present; one to hold firmly the broken crossbar, and the other to stretch out the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until its form is achieved as required; and there should be no prominence or concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's chin a sphere made of cloth or wool; and its size should be according to the quantity of your need; stretch and elevate the crossbar, and press the sphere with your hand until you equalize the fracture as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot pull the extremity of the crossbar to the outside because it has reached deep; then the patient should lie on his back on his neck; and place a block under his shoulder in size, and press the assistant's arm towards the bottom until the bone of the crossbar is elevated from the deep to the top; at that point, correct the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 But if you feel a protrusion from the crossbar and it moves; then it is necessary to press down on it and extract the protrusion easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If it is retained in the bone, then use instruments prepared for incision of that kind, after you place under a lever the instrument which serves as a grip; and the instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a snail shell without a concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And let its width be according to what you need for it due to the size of the bone and its part.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 But its length should also be as possible for you in surgery.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And it shall have two ends, as you see: one end shall be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If the fracture of the wound that you have cut when removing the splinter of bone is wide, and it is hot, then gather together two lips of the wound with stitching.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the fracture is small or you fear a hot abscess, then fill the wound with cloths and wool according to the size of the cut in the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 And if it happens that a hot abscess occurs, then pour cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine on it, and place it over it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 But the setting of bone without a wound and without an incision is, to place plaster on it made from flour milled with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And put soft wool over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a sphere under its edge if needed.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take the rotula (bloodletter), that is, a rod held by Arabs, which should be very long; and its width should be about one palm or nearly that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place doubled wool over the soft wool and the plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take an awl made of thin wood, whose width should be three fingers, and the same in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then roll her (it) in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then roll the bandage with starch in the place of alumen that falls over the fracture and the wound.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place alumen on the fracture as it is rolled, and roll it over its neck, and under the healthy titillicum and the weak one: and bring it back over all parts, so that you can see that the ligature holds the fracture tightly: and this is what should not be covered by you, and completely, so that the starch does not remove the splint from the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And for this reason, it is necessary to examine the weak one every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 How often then does the bandage become soft and you see the starch already removed? Then correct it, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the pillow of the sick one on his back, and put a small cushion under the healthy titillicum for him at night, so that with it he lifts up the assistance from the side himself.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Then lift the fracture of the collarbone through lifting the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind the arm to the neck of the same; and do not loosen the bandage, unless it happens in the place that occurs from itching or sores, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see his face towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add to the ligature and release it, until it heals and hardens.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 The fracture of the collarbone is tightened and strengthened to a great extent for twenty days; and sometimes it happens in fewer in some men.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Chapter on the healing of the fracture of the spatula.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 Rarely does the spatula break and in a wide place of it; and they do not break from it except for its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When a place is broken from it and breaks in the middle of it, and it can only be known through touch: then prepare for the fracture according to its figure.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 Reduce it to its natural form by all means possible of your intellect.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place on the place powder from a mill with albumen of egg, and soft wax, and put on top a small piece of double-fold cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place over it a broad awl from thin wood according to the size of the spatula or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If there is any concavity under the awl in the spatula, then equal the concavity with soft wax until the awl descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then bind above it with long alum strips, with a suitable tightening, and the awl's firmness, until it is not moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 Consider the binding every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever the binding becomes soft, bind it again, and equal the awl if it is moved from its place: let it lie weak on the healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 The spatula should be restored in twenty or thirty days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number has been completed, then loosen the binding: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is from the bones whose fracture is not feared nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If it proceeds from a bone splinter and pierces below the skin: then cut through it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as we said for a fracture of the neck of the scapula by hot cautery, if something happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Chapter on the restoration of breast fractures.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The chest is sometimes broken in the middle, and it happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 The extremities of it break and are crushed due to its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 If its middle part that tends towards the lower parts breaks and a severe pain occurs along with difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and perhaps blood is vomited, and a hollow appears on the broken bone which is not concealed to the senses, The restoration of it is for the weak to lie on his back and place a poultice between his spatulas.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press his shoulders and bring the ribs together from both sides or flanks with hands: and grind it on an equal basis, in every possible way until it returns to the form of the bone, as is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place on him an emplaster and a stuffing, and place above it a star-shaped piece of thin material made from willow or sandalwood, or similar materials wrapped in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then grind it on a binding over the broken bone so that it is not displaced: and go with the bindings according to its roundness towards the back several times, and tie it with an appropriate suture.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the bindings in every hour and whenever it softens, tie it: and if necessity requires dissolution of it due to itching or corrosion that occurs at the place, or pain, or abscess, then hurry and dissolve it, and remove the poultice, and correct whatever has occurred with the method of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then return the poultice if you see it facing towards that: and attach a suture until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Chapter on Restoration of Ribs when they break.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that the fracture of ribs does not occur except in thick places following the back and from their extremities from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 It does not happen to them (the joints) by friction, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of it (the part) is not hidden from the sense during investigation with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And its restoration is made thus: so that it aligns the fracture with fingers according to the possible method, until it becomes equal in form, as required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then plasters, and tie the broken bone with a bandage, if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the fracture is oblique towards the inner parts (of the chest): then a severe pain occurs in the weak, and puncturing, such as the puncturing that occurs to one who has pleurisy; because the bone pierces the membrane, and also difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of blood frequently: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients have been skilled in this with many skills; and among them are those who say that one should place food for the weak which generates inflammation and flatulence, so that the stomach is inflamed, and expanded, and pushed against the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We, however, abhor to make a rapid cause for making a hot abscess, if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If, however, it has already occurred, then one adds it (the hot abscess).
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them say: place a flatulent substance on the place, then squeeze it forcefully, and it is more like reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 Nevertheless, it is feared that it attracts excessive flatulence to the place, due to the disposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them say: the place must be covered with wool that has already been soaked in hot oil; and little lice should be placed between the ribs, until it is filled (the abscess); so that the bandage is equal when one folds it according to roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick person shall be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If the illness presses heavily upon the sick person and causes pain, or if we pierce the skin with a lancet, causing injury, and we fear for him: then it is necessary to divide at the site, and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we shall place upon it the instrument which we have mentioned before (the cautery called sifac), and cut through the bone with ease, and cut the same.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we shall bring together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures: and treat the same with plasters, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If a warm abscess should occur during the interval: then apply hot cuppings, and pour powdered almonds into warm oil, and place it on the site: and treat the sick person with that which is suitable for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 In addition, a cushion shall be placed upon the side on which he lies until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 Chapter on the restoration of the fracture of the Spine and Neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fracture occasionally occurs in the bones of the neck, and rarely happens to them attrition; similarly, in the spondylous of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 When this occurs to anyone and you wish to know if it will heal or not: then consider (or examine).
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see that his hands have already become softened, stunned, and dead; and he cannot move them, extend them, or contract them; and when you press them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, nor does he feel pain in them: then you shall know that it will not heal, and in many dispositions it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If he moves them and feels the constriction with fingers and prick (or pain) in them: then you shall know that the nucha bone is safe, and that the weak one will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If this occurs in the spondylous of the back and you wish to know if it will heal or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they have become softened, and this happens to them as it happened to the hands: then when he lies on his back, flatulence and constipation occur without will; and when he lies on his abdomen, flatulence occurs without will; and when he lies on his back again, wishing to urinate, but cannot: then you shall know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Do not labor in the treatment of him (i.e., do not treat him).
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If it does not happen to him anything from that, the case is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for what happens to him from that is to apply warm oil (or fat) on the affected spondylous; thus you shall place warm oil only on the rubbed spondylous, or with goose grease saturated ointment.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it repeatedly upon the same [wound] daily until the abscess becomes warm: then place upon the location one of the soothing and draining plasters, and bind it over with a ligament: and instruct the sick one to use quiet and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 Let him not sleep on the side where he has found pain, until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it should occur due to the dislocation of the hip bone or something that has already separated from it: then it is necessary to sever it through the skin, and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with some meaty substance, from ointments, until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 But if the last bone of the alhausos is broken and the end of the tail is: then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and with the other hand align the broken bone as much as possible, according to what is possible, and in the second alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on top of it and remove it: and take care of the wound with the treatment that preceded it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Restoration of an ankle.
Caput XI.	 Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 The bones of the ankles rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If the bones break, then their fracture is not anything other than a comminution at the ends of them; they are split lengthwise and bent towards the interior; and it occurs in the sick man that there is pain in the location and puncturing; and the leg which breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until you stand over the fracture in the manner of its figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at the ends of it, then align the broken part with that which is prepared for you from alignment, until it resembles its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If a fracture is in length or already inclined towards the inside parts, then lay the weak one on his stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you have matched it (the fracture), place plaster on it; then place a splint made of wood or hide over it and tie a bandage above it where you fear neither displacement of the fracture nor removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And make the concavity of those (the bones) match with that which fills it, until the bandage fits it equally; and command the weak one to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If, however, it happens to him (the patient) that a hot abscess occurs: then cease from extending it and its treatment, until the hot abscess settles; and place what he sits on over it, as was before, and then return to its treatment; and tie it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If, however, it happens to the bone that it is gnawed or crushed, extract (the foreign object).
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Chapter on the Restoration of Fractures (of Adiutorius)
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII:
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 Assistance is that which extends from the elbow to the head of a spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One method is that you take a flat piece of wood of medium size in the following shape.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And tie two ligaments at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Next it is suspended from a raised place: and the sick one sits on the chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then he throws his broken arm upon a log until it reaches the notch of that log, where the crack of the wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then hang something heavy above him to stretch the patient below.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician sets the fracture with his hands until it returns to its proper place.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 Another method is for the sick one to lie on his back: and his hand is suspended from his neck with a rope.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then command two attendants to hold one of them above the fracture with their hands: and let another hold him below, while each one stretches his part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you wish for a stronger extension, then tie something under the fracture with a rope, and above it with another: and each of the two attendants stretches his part to its respective side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, then a ligament must be placed under the notch and another one towards the elbow joint.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then a ligament must be placed above that place and another one on the elbow.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then align the fracture easily without strain until it is equal according to what is required and properly applied: then bind it if no hot abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding for seven days.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 Place a piece of linen soaked in vinegar and rose oil on him until the abscess subsides: then bind it: and the method of binding is to apply a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then place the inversion from new cloth upon the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then gather the arm upon the help itself, and place his open hand upon his own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 Place the cloth and bind upon the help of the arm so that the arm remains at the position of stars: if it does not forbid you by something, nor be changed by anything from a broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If you fear that something will be changed by a broken bone, then use stars: and there is one, so that you place upon the fracture itself a star which is wider and stronger than other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place the width of each star at the length of a finger: and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind upon the stars the ligature which I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And there is that your ligature should be stronger over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And as much as the fracture is prolonged, the ligature should be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If therefore you see the position of stars and ligature, as we said, at the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do it: and if you fear a hot abscess, then release the ligature and stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the ligature in all three days, so that it does not happen at the place an itch, or swelling, or food is forbidden to reach the limb, because of the position of excessive ligature.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Correct therefore this whole thing, as we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If indeed you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not release the ligature, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 And let the rest of the sick one be on his back and his hand upon his stomach: and place under the help a blanket full of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 Consider at every hour of the night or day, so that the shape of the broken member is not loosened, nor the ligament softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Correct it all with your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 Then place the food for the sick according to the order that we have commanded, so that it is a subtle food at first, until the bone begins to tighten; then it should be made to grow thicker for him.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For it is the custom of helping and healing a leg that it should be tightened for forty days; then, therefore, it should be loosened, and a bath should be administered, and it should be treated with ointments which correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture is foul, scrape it; then do not loosen the ligament and the splints from it for fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Chapter on the restoration of a broken arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two fore-arm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of them is small; and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and it is that which is placed below the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore, perhaps only the larger fore-arm bone is broken, or perhaps both are broken.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When the small fore-arm bone above is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the lower fore-arm bone is broken, the fracture of it is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And it is worse when both bones are broken simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If the bone that is broken is the small fore-arm bone above, then it suits the doctor in its restoration, that he puts on an extension smaller with ease, until it equals itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 But if the large fore-arm bone is the one that is broken: then it is necessary that a strong bandage be put on.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 It is necessary that [the figure of] the hand should be placed [there] at its restoration, and [its extension] extended upon the pulley.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 The thumb should be higher than all the fingers, and the lower joint [of the thumb] should be higher than all the other [joints or fingers], or what is left of them: and the weak one sitting square on himself, and let the pulley be before him, or in front of him, at a height so that he does not strain himself.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then, let the servant extend the arm from its lower part, with his hand, or with a ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another servant extends it likewise from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the doctor equalizes [or adjusts] the bone until he can bring it back to its best shape possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are shards [or fragments] of bone in the fracture, then try to reduce all the fragments to their respective places by your own effort.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 But if it appears that a shard of bone is separated and pierces the skin and there is no hope for its restoration, then plug it over and remove it according to the method we have mentioned earlier.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 But if there is a fracture with a wound, I have already written a separate chapter about it, therefore take its treatment from that point onward.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If at the beginning of your restoration a hot abscess occurs, then take linen cloth made with beeswax mixed with rose oil and white wax, and let it be of medium thickness between thickness and subtlety: and bind the cloth over it tightly with a thin string until the abscess settles down: then remove the beeswax, and place an ointment prepared from milled flour and egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place the awls [or metal splints], and let the awl that is placed over the fracture be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of awls for the arm is six in several arrangements: whether it is a fracture in one splint, or in two splints at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your tie (ligature) over the stronger and more prominent part of the fracture, and a little farther towards the upper part of the fracture, or towards its lower part: or place a softer ligature on it, as previously remembered in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 The bandages that cover the fracture should be soft, damp: they should not be hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen and medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 Consider the limb (body part) and ligament after days (time has passed).
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something happens that requires rectification, such as itching on the limb: then it is necessary to apply warm embrocation to the limb with hot water until the itch subsides, and leave the limb unbound until it subsides, then tie it again.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the ligature has been softened and the bone removed, and similar things have happened: then correct it all with your art, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 Because if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to the excess of the ligature, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and leave it for some days until it reaches its nourishment, then tie it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if nothing of what we have mentioned happens to the sick (person), then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days, or around that time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then the hands of the sick one are suspended on his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be straight, and keep it from unnecessary movements with your art.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 Know that this fracture is restored in thirty or forty days; and it may be restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 The whole thing is according to the dispositions of humors and the dispositions of virtues.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 On the restoration of broken bones in hands.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that the breakage of the hand and the joints of fingers happens rarely.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 And it does not happen to him unless he is rubbed repeatedly.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When a foot breakage occurs or by rubbing, then it is necessary that the lame man sits on a stool; and before him there should be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand on it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then the servant should spread out the broken bones, and the doctor should adjust them until they join together well with good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary that he applies plaster and wool, if there is no hot abscess occurring.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place a splint on top according to the size of the place; and you already wound it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the breakage is in the lower part around the heel of the foot, then make a similar ball from cloth; and order the lame man to bend over it with his broken foot; then it should be wrapped with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And the splint should be made of calfskin, with softness so that it can be applied to the body of the foot; and it should be wrapped according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the breakage is on the outside, then it is necessary that you place a splint on top and another one from below on the foot; and keep the hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then put a bandage, as the hand is rolled up; and extend it between the fingers with a band.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If a breakage happens to any of the joints of fingers, then if it is the thumb, adjust as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then wrap with the foot; and if there are fingers, place a straight splint under it, smaller; so that the breakage is lifted up and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, index, ear or ring finger, then it should be equalized and tied with a healthy finger that follows it; or they may all be tied according to continuity, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Place on top of it a smaller splint, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And consider in your restoration and after its arrangement, the application of warm poultices; and apply what is necessary when something happens from it, according to its repeated narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 Chapter on the restoration of a hip fracture.
Caput XV.	 Chapter Fifteen.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The hip bone is broken often and becomes apparent to the senses; because it is turned towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration is made by tying a ligament above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 The sick one lies on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then stretch out every ligament serving to its part according to equality; and this is when the fracture is in the middle bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 If the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let a ligament be to the side of the pelvis so that the extension falls upwards; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let a ligament be near the knee so that the extension falls to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician equates the bone with both hands of his, until he reduces it to its natural shape; and it unites the bone with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then it is necessary that you place an emulsion and a tight bandage if there is no abscess in the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs there: then leave it for some days until the abscess settles down warm; then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 Stricture it accordingly.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 You should wrap a hard linen around the fracture; that is, bind it: and double it twice, or thrice: and let there remain an excess of it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wrap the leg until you reach the heel at the root of the toes.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 Insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee, and let the ends of the thread come out from the upper parts of both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then roll the excess on the leg and hip.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place stars on the hip at the site of the fracture itself, and place one star on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the voids between the leg and hip with soft cloths to make the compression equal.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin with strong compressions from the middle of the fracture site with three or four wraps.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you loosen the bandage from the fracture site, let your compression be less and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then turn to both ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie three stars on each end of it.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go to both ends of the thread to the bottom, until you reach the ankle of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And with each end, also tie the ends of the stars on the opposite side so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then release the compression on that side until it no longer causes the member to rot, or develop an abscess, swelling, or similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If something happens from there.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Approach it again with the resolution of that matter, and correct entirely whatever happens from there according to what we said many times before.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 But if a splinter is in the bone that pierces it: then it is necessary to remove it equally, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 If not, find on it and remove it; and take care of the one who preceded it until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 When this hip fracture is tightly bound with splints, as mentioned in the adjuvant and arm chapter, it should be kept immobile until it has healed.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 Nevertheless, in healing such a fracture, lameness does not occur for the weak.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 If it is healed alone, except that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary for the one who has it, to lameness always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And know that the hip is bound for fifty days or it is too little or too much; all of this is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 Chapter on healing a knee-joint fracture.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that the knee joint rarely fractures but it often suffers from attrition.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 But if it happens to be a fracture, then it is not otherwise than a crack or hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And it occurs with an injury, and without an injury.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 It stands on that whole part with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 Its healing is as follows: it should be made to fit together the parts that were broken with fingers until it grows and joins together according to what is possible from adjustment and ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then put a plaster made from barley flour or milled flour with egg white on it; and place over it a round splint, if needed; and bind above it with a suitable splint.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions that we have mentioned in other fractures; such as a hot abscess and similar things; so that you counter every occurrence with what suits it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 Chapter on healing a leg-fracture.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that the leg consists of two bones, one is large and called the Leg: and the other small and called Ankle.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And it often happens that a fracture of this kind occurs in both legs, as it does in two bones of the arm; and for this reason the repair is made equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If both bones are broken, the leg will bend in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if the small bone is broken, the leg bends towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 If the large bone is broken, you will find it lower: and it is among those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer extension, equalization, and ligature of the stars equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 Nevertheless, if the fracture of the leg is a foul one, with many seething, you should have lesser and gentler extension.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 In the leg indeed there is something more than in the arm during the operation: and it is that when you equalize the stars and complete your entire operation, then take two bands made of pine wood, which are used in the manufacture of solariorum placed under tables; and they are made from the blades of the palm; and choose from them those with a small thickness, and neither be too thin; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then fold over one cloth with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 Place one part of the leg on one side and the other part on the other side: and let it be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then bind the two bands in three places at both ends and in the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For since compression is forbidden, the leg will bend to the right and left, and stand with good posture.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And indeed, the cradle should be made of wood in the length of the leg, and the leg should be placed in it to keep it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 And indeed, it is necessary that you make this for a fracture when there is a wound with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the leg every day and strive to keep it free from gangrene, swelling, or any other ailments.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If any of these occur, then apply to it whatever is necessary until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the fracture of bones in the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 The calcaneus bone does not usually break completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Fractures of the bones in the foot occur sometimes, and fractures in the fingers are rare as well; they do not usually happen to them unless they are rubbed in multiple positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture of the bones in the foot occurs and you see that the bones are lifting up above each other, then place the injured foot on the ground prepared as when walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand and place your foot on the elevated bone; afterwards press or tread on it; and keep it even, until it returns to its original position.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then apply ointment and plaster on top; place a small table under the heel of the foot with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with an appropriate strap after you have wrapped it with linen cloths and whatever else is needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 When three or four days have passed, then unbind the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones aligned if they are fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 Therefore, treatment is done as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If some fingers are broken, then restore them and align them as I have told you for the restoration of fingers on the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place your finger as long as the digit, and let it be a little wider; then place under the foot this plank that I told you, and bind it with an appropriate suture.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If what is fractured consists of two or more bones, then place a plaster of the appropriate size over each digit, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the plank below the foot; let it be standing on one head of the plank outside the abdomen of the foot to hold it firmly.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 And it is appropriate for you not to forget that you should consider everything that I told you in the other fractures, which we have mentioned; and apply each case with what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 Section on female facial fracture, clavicle bone, and male pelvic fracture.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's face is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then lower her to the back part of it slightly and hold her backward.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Next, let the midwife fill the woman's wound with a linen cloth until it is filled; and make the wound on her face like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then the woman should be shaken and her back gradually flattened.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For that linen cloth will come out until it is made before the door of the wound like a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a poultice on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 When she wants to urinate, let her remove the linen cloth easily, then cleanse; and return it in the manner by which you first inserted it; then return to the poultice first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Let that be done for seven days or about, because the bone itself will heal.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take the bladder of an animal, bind it over its opening with a reed cannula, and insert the entire bladder into her wound.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow into the cannula with force until the bladder is inflated within the cavity, for the fracture will return.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then fill it with a padding and let it remain for some days, as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the skullcap of a man or woman breaks, administer to its restoration and apply what we have said about Ancha's bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 Do not hide the rectum in these nearby fractures, which seldom occur, especially if one has some knowledge or experience.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 Understand that my book is much, for the fracture itself indicates to you in many ways the course of the rectum and its constriction in its restoration and healing; therefore understand it.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 In a man's penis when it breaks, take the goose's throat: insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place on top of it a covering made of cloth and wrap it up, let it rest for three days or around that time, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 [Chapter Title] On the restoration of bone fractures when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is appropriate for one who has a bone fracture along with a wound, especially if it is large like the hip bone or arm bone, to rush and immediately call for bloodletting; if the conditions of bloodletting are attested to you as we have said.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound flows blood, then it is necessary that you rush to its cutting, spreading powder on top of it as much as possible if no other remedy is present for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to repair the fracture on the same day; do not delay this, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If an abscess hot, then delay the repair of it until the ninth day, until the abscess settles down.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach him on the third and fourth day, because you would cause bad accidents to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the broken bone projects above the skin, then it is necessary to pull it back and align it with your hands easily and slightly extend it.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If the extension is not prepared and alignment by your hands, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the tool is made of iron, whose length is the size of seven or eight fingers, and its width according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them according to the amount needed for that in any kind of healing in all types of fractures.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And it should be round; and there should be a small thickness to avoid doubling under pressure on it during the operation hour; and its tip should be sharp, with an edge at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And the surface of it should be broad from the middle to the bottom.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is the form of it.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is necessary in this operation that the tip of it should be sharp and rounded on top of the protruding bone; and push it with one thrust until the bone returns and aligns itself in some way.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Try to align the extremities of the fracture against each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the extremities of the broken bone are delicate and do not accept the tool well, then it is necessary to cut the edge of that bone until the tool has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If you cannot pull it out as we have explained altogether, then cut it with what is suitable for him from the incisions which we mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in any way that is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then file down what remains on the bone from its roughness and small layers.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 When the bone is pulled out and if it becomes weak after being pulled back and causes a violent pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For by doing so, you confer great aid upon the weak, when you complete the restoration that you do to the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then immerse a linen cloth in wine steeped in black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly if it is during summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place on the wound any green substances or anything containing oil; so as not to cause rot and decay at the wound site.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer astilas at the hour of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And let the wound heal; thus, you will cut with forceps the opening in the inflammation according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And beware with all caution, that you do not squeeze the wound when it is broken.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For many times have foolish physicians done this; and they have caused death or decay or gangrene, that is, blood poisoning.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let your ligature be soft, gentle, diverse from the other fracture ligatures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or large, and you fear certain evil accidents which we have mentioned, and find pain at a suspended location: then it is not necessary to place astilas on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make incisions from hard cloths in the place of astilas, and tighten it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 When, however, it is one day or two days later, and you see that the wound begins to produce pus: then remove from above the linen cloth which you had placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then apply linen and ointments according to our custom for treating wounds, such as four-ingredient ointment (tetrapharmacon) and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it is fitting for you, that you loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 And examine the wound every day at morning and evening until it heals and cures.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way as to allow the pus to flow out from it easily towards the lower part.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many days pass without the wound healing or pus being expelled from it: then you will know that there is a small fracture of the bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, you should examine the wound with pressure.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 As for the number of small fractures separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those that are not separated and pierce the limb, causing pain, try to cut them and remove them in any way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If there occurs a gangrene or suppuration, that is, putrefaction and corruption: then it is necessary to apply to each one of them what is suitable for its treatment, whose treatment was previously described in the corresponding chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And from the discussion that I have made so far and to which you should give your full attention when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip or shoulder bones, and similar large ones: do not presume to set it yourself, for frequently death occurs from this; rather let it be until it becomes putrefied.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps it falls by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then care for the wound if it seems to you: and if not, let it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 On the treatment of a nodule on a fracture's track.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 This frequently occurs as a knotting in the process of healing a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Primarily, what is near the joints: it becomes ugly due to this shape of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And possibly prevents the member from its natural movement.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore, consider if the knotting is recent: administer to it medications that have a stiffening effect, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Thus, take some or all of these: and mix them with stiffening wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them on the knotting in a plaster, and bind it well with a good bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And leave the bandage, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then unbind it, and bind another one until the knotting is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or bind well over it a leaden plate.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the members.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the knotting has already turned into stone and is hardened and urgently calls for its removal: then apply a plaster from above it, and cut off the excessive projecting part: or file it with certain rasps until it is removed: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 Chapter on treatment when the member remains subtle after that, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture is restored and the member remaining after it is subtle and weak, it is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of the reasons is that there is a large amount of disintegration of the ligament and its binding not as required: either due to excess restriction of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from flowing to the member: or due to excessive embrocation at an inappropriate time: or due to a small amount of blood in the body of the weak person, and its debilitation.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 The care for this is to feed the weak person, and make his body tender until blood multiplies in him.
Et administra balneum.	 Administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And pour joy and gladness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the member, so that it attracts much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And anoint it with embrocation and warm water until the nourishment runs, and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored twisted.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 If a limb already restored after its healing becomes twisted and the bone of the fracture protrudes or knots, and it is disfigured by that part of the limb, but the limb does not forbid its natural operation, then one should not receive the speech of that person who thinks that the limb must be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there have been many fools among doctors and restorers who did this on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 And this operation is indeed to be greatly condemned, leading to death or a great fear that it might be deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 But if limping and knotting are recent: then it is necessary to anoint with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of elder, its root, and honeysuckle, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And let it be made as an ointment with a softening plaster, as ditchulon properly made.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Let the mucilage of the root of the marshmallow be taken, and grind it with chicken fat or sesame oil; and let it be applied with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Let figs be taken and ground with pigeon dung and similar ones which are named among the medications that diminish consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes a knot is loosened with constant and gentle rubbing, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 Let motion be applied to the member in every hour (of the day).
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If, however, the twist has already occurred and it has become strong, and has turned into a stone, and there is necessity for its treatment with iron: then it is necessary that it be cut above it, and the continuation of the bone be loosened, and what remains superfluous from the knot or the bone with chisels be cut away: and let ease be applied to it with diligence and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 Chapter on Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the departure of any joints from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it should be prevented from moving and why it becomes deformed in appearance of the member.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes severe pain to occur on top of the weak, and violent injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 When therefore a dislocation occurs, then it is necessary to hasten for its restoration; nor should it be delayed at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if it is delayed, the place may recede, and possibly with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore, it should not be moved nor extended in the hour of its relocation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because many times it causes spasms and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 However, when that happens, then it is necessary to rush for the bloodletting of the weak.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it should be allowed to rest until the abscess has subsided.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then broom the limb with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it should be reduced easily.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And every part of the body should be treated with it, when its remembrance comes to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I myself have already ordered chapters on dislocations, even according to what was previously discussed in the context of fractures, from the top part of the body downwards.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Chapter on the treatment of lower jaw dislocation.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 Two mandibles are scarcely dislocated except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 Dislocation of both [occurs] according to two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 For either they are moved slightly from their places and softened slightly, or they are separated with great force.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or the dislocations are complete and integral until they are softened up to the breast, until the saliva of the sick man runs out and he cannot hold it nor close his mouth, and his tongue is rolled up with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When the dislocation is slight, then it returns by itself in various positions with scarcity.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If the dislocation is complete and integral, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly and without delay: and there should be someone to hold the head of the sick man; and the doctor should insert his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated mandible, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or two thumbs are inserted at the same time, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, as he sees fit.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And command the sick man to clean his mandibles and to wash them for eating on every side.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The doctor pushes the mandible and forces it back to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction is difficult, especially if both mandibles are at the same time, then administer steam with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy; do not delay the reduction of both, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they return and come together and the sick man's mouth is closed, and they are not softened: then place on them small pieces of cloth, with wax that has been made from beeswax; and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it should be tied easily with soft ligatures.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And let the sleep of the sick man be on his back: and let his head be supported between two pillows so that he does not move it to the right and to the left: neither let him try or be forced to chew something: rather, let his food be made soft, until when the pain is removed, and the jaw is loosened: then let him eat whatever he wants, and let this be administered easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 Let him not strain on the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and speaking, until the jaw is loosened and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some hour and do not return to their places: then fever often occurs, and continuous vomiting: and perhaps the sick man's abdomen bursts open, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 Therefore, when you see this: then you will know that it is a fatal event, and he who experiences this often dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of dislocation of the neck and the limb of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The neck is not dislocated from within on the side, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And it is sometimes dislocated to the outside: and this can be felt.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 And its restoration is that the sick man lies on his back and stretches out his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then bend your hand into a fist with a strong grasp: for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then place the plaster and pillows on top of it, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 The limbs following the elbow, which are connected to it, are not usually dislocated, unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is dislocated on some day: then it must be reduced and set in accordance with what we have said, and as you will prepare for yourself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place on it [the wound] the plaster, and the leeches, and the suture.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And tell the sick person, to hold fast to tranquility and rest, until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 When this same treatment brings about the relief of the shoulder's extremity, even if it also separates from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 You should know that the humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One of them is when it dislocates to the palmar side towards the lower parts.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second one is when it dislocates to the chest area.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it may be dislocated towards the upper part of the humerus; and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it is not dislocated to the back side, because of the spine (of the scapula).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it is not dislocated to the front side, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 Mostly it is indeed dislocated and exits towards the palmar side; especially in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Since it goes out quickly and enters quickly (back into place).
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is plentiful, it is just the opposite, namely that it goes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty (back into place).
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps it happens to some people by a blow or an accident and the humerus is pushed out by a blow with something hot, and they think this because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, you must try that out until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 The dislocation is known when it is towards the palmar side; and you distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you find among them an obvious difference, and in the head of the humerus you find a depression, and under the palm of the hand at touch, it seems like an egg; and an invalid cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards; then you find a clear feeling that is not concealed.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent or if the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 And its reduction is, that he lifts his assistant's hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs under his thumb and lift the joint firmly upwards to its place; and the assistant lifts his hand, and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then he puts it down below, for he quickly returns (to its position).
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If it does not go back as we have said, and from the beginning to where dislocation occurs there are many days; then it is necessary that the sick one be bathed in warm water, and treated with an embrocation which softens and soothes, such as if they decoct root of althea, and fenugreek, and melilotus in water, and it (the embrocation) is administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the sick one lies down on his back; and a sphere and wool are to be placed under his thumb which is equal between softening and tightening.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor places his heel on the sphere, and lifts the head of the arm with force, and draws the hand of the sick one downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another assistant holds the head of the sick one, so that it is not moved downwards; for he returns immediately (to its position).
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, do so according to this method; and it is that you make a man who is longer than the sick one present, who stands from the side, and intrudes his arm under the thumb of the sick one: and lifts the thumb upwards, until the sick one is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another assistant pulls the hand of the sick one downwards towards the stomach of the same.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the sick one is light: then it is necessary that something else is suspended with him to weigh him down; for the dislocation returns immediately (to its position).
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it is also reduced according to another method; and it is that a long wooden stick is formed on the ground, whose head is round-shaped like a mitten of the deadman's arm (mortarer's arm), which is not too thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then, place it under the sick one after the logs of soft wood have been placed on his head; and let the sick person stand according to the length of the logs.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then his hand is to be extended towards the lower part from one side; and his body is to be extended from the other side with force; for the joining [of bones] returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If it is difficult to reduce [the fracture] by all the means we have mentioned, then employ this remedy: you shall take a log whose length is equal to two forearms and its width is four fingers, and its thickness is that of two fingers; the end should be rounded so as to widen the entrance into the deep socket [of the joint], in this manner.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then, soft cloths are placed over the rounded log to prevent injury to the sick log.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then, it is to be placed under the injured joint so that his hand or arm can be extended over the log until reaching the lower part; and the log is to be bound to the help [the other log], arm, and end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then, place his arm on a step of the ladder [the other log] by its width; and extend his hand towards the lower part; and let the rest of the body hang suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For the joining [of bones] quickly enters.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 When the entrance is completed in whatever manner possible; then it is necessary to place a sphere of equal size under the injured joint [the other log].
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place a prepared plaster made from milled powder with balm and albumen of egg white over the entire shoulder as it is rotated above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then tighten a bandage under the injured joint; and rotate the strap over the plaster above; and connect his hand to the neck of the same [person]; let it be, without moving his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 It is necessary that food be sparse until the limb recovers, for it heals more quickly.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then let it (the dressing) be larger after seven or five days, and let it be shaken with motion.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it hardens and is not softened, then it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 But if the joint is repeatedly dislocated due to the moisture that occurs or for another reason: then it is necessary to administer cautery with three holes, according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If this is done and the ligament is dissolved after seven days and the joint is not hardened and the emplaster and compression are not applied to it several times nor does it become hard and falls and cannot be raised towards above: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus have been cut or stretched or softened: and you know that the joint will never become fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 For a dislocation towards the chest and breast or reduction to the rear is done with pressure and extension using hands until it returns, and then further compression and care are applied until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If pain or slowness of movement occurs after healing in the limb, then the sick person should use baths many times until that pain is alleviated and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Chapter on the treatment of the elbow joint.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 You should know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty as well; and it is indeed dislocated in all directions, but particularly towards the front or the rear.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And you will know that this dislocation is not hidden from you; because it falls under sight and touch, whichever way it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join a dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is made apparent to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 For indeed the joint will be concave and the arm cannot double, nor can it touch its own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you hasten and immediately reduce the dislocation, before a hot abscess occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if a hot abscess occurs, the reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For indeed, every form of dislocation is worse and more painful; and many times death follows with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the restoration of it, when it can be reduced, is that the hand should be extended with two hands; and the arm should be expanded, and the hands of the physician should be above the elbow and below it, and he himself should push the joint with the tips of his fingers or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or if the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns in such a way that it doubles the hand with its own, until it strikes the elbow which is dislocated with the root of its palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 But if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then administer a strong and violent extension; and it is that two attendants extend the arm; and they should hold him also so that he is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm is turned to every side after it has been wrapped around its own hand with a double cloth or wide bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he binds it with oil; so that it is from those things which aid in the lubricity of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he pushes the joint with a strong push until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After the reduction [of the fracture], it should be placed on top of it a plaster with styptics and cauterization with the white of an egg; the stricture should be tied securely.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 Suspend the arm from the neck of the patient, and let it rest for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then, it is to be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If the joint has been fixed in its place, then unbind it from there and let it rest.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 If you see that the joint is not bound well, then repeat the plaster, bind it again, and let it rest for several days until it has healed.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then, it is to be loosened again.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If there is pain after the reduction of the joint and its condition is moving: then administer a moistening in bathing, fine friction, and compression until it settles down, or put over the joint, that is, the fat of the lamb's wool.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then, bind it, and let it rest for a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then, remove it [the plaster], and immerse it [the affected part] in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When it sweats, then gently friction the joint with a tempered friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then, repeat over it three times with the white of an egg, on its first, second, and third entry into the bath, until it becomes softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place over it dung of a cow, moistened and heated with butter, and bind it over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do this often.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 It becomes softened, and returns to its normal condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 Chapter on the treatment of dislocations by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Albucasis frequently treats a dislocation, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 The reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 In opposition to the remaining joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 It is necessary that speed be in the reduction of the dislocation at the hour when it occurs, before the location is cut open; or an abscess may occur in it, which is hot.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of a dislocation in this is that you place Mahassem, the weak hand, upon a table, and extend the assistant's hand; and the physician places his palm upon the prominent joint, and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 Nevertheless, it should be considered if the palm has already retreated to the belly of the hand; then let the weak part of the hand be placed upon a table during extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let its position be intrinsically upon the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed upon the table, so that the physician falls upon the prominent joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then tie it with a plaster letting an abscess form; leave it alone, do not touch it again.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if it cannot be borne, nor can you make the reduction of it after the days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its twist; and nothing harms the weak except that it is softened by the hand, and nothing can be tied; then you will know that the nerves have been severed or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 It is not clever in this, except to tie it with a cautery near its loss.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps that does not benefit it at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 When Almahassem does not return, then place a plaster upon him as I have said.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then tie it, and let it be for five days; afterwards it is loosened and let go, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If it is deprived of movement, and something heavy happens to it; then soften it with warm water and rub it occasionally until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 On the treatment of dislocations of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	 De Osteotomia Ossium Corporis Hum
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated in any direction or towards the back of the palm or the palm's inside, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to its place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then hold the head of the finger and turn it towards the direction of the dislocation and let it be for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then suspend it (the finger) and extend it until it becomes straight on the same day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it is night, bind it as described (in the text) and do not cease to loosen it during the day; exercise it with movement, and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do this for several days until it becomes tight (healed).
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; bind it to that part and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And do the same if it is dislocated in other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 On the treatment of dislocations of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	 De Osteotomia Ossium Corporis Hum.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When anyone suffers from a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back or neck, or many vertebrae are displaced from their places, there is no cure for it, because death approaches the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of this is that the sickness departs from him without his will, nor can he hold it; sometimes some of his limbs become soft, or two legs or two arms of his own, or one of them; or a vertebra is displaced from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 Often it happens that it (the dislocation) moves and is often removed to the four directions.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 That which is moved towards the back is called gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 The cure for this (disease) is that you consider it if it occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment in it, and there is no healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in that which occurs due to an accident, or blow, or similar cases, the ancient ones have already explained the modes of treatment in a long discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 It yields least return when it is profitable (or: when it prospers).
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I have already abridged from that which excuses itself little by much due to my proximity to its intention; and in my exposition of it, and the construction of its instrument, I formed it differently than they showed it and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say that in a hunchback which occurs from the front part, there is no talent, and healing is not from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in that which happens on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured from them (the humpbacks) except that which occurs on the back properly, as I am about to say; and it must be stretched out, the weak one over his face on a platform equal nearly to the wall; and it must be spread beneath him wet linen so that his chest is not injured.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then a straight piece of wood is placed fixed in a basin on the ground at the end of the platform, around his head; and another piece of wood about his feet at the end of the other platform; and let someone hold the piece of wood, and it shall not be fastened to the basin.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And the second person holds the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then bend over the head of the weak one, and under his chin tie a soft but firm bandage; and extend the end of the bandage to the piece of wood which is by his head; and tie him there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then tighten another bandage over his ankles, and above his knees, and at the fetters (or: shackles) of his feet.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the ligaments and tie them on another piece of wood that is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then let every servant extend the ligament to the piece of wood, and neither of the woods should be removed from their places where they are fixed; however, they should not be tightly bound, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 The physician shall place his hands on the pelvis with force until he returns; or he may place it on a table.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he connects his feet to the table until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If he does not return by this treatment, then take a table whose length is about three arms (elbows).
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And carve a hole in the wall which we have said is near the sick one, for the end of the table to enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle part of the table on the pelvis.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 The physician shall then place his feet on the other end (of the table).
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And the physician binds it tightly until the pelvis is dislocated and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then, if you wish, work with the lathe which revolves with your hand; and there is, so that you may mark on the ground at the head of the sick one two pieces of wood, whose length is an arm each; and at his head, on the same side, two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And the length between every piece of wood is a palm; and now a hole has been made in every place where the lathe runs; and each piece of wood must be firmly fixed to the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 A round piece of wood is inserted; and the lathe, in which the ligament revolves, has two holes on the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at the end of it (the lathe) is a hole where the piece of wood is fixed, whose length is a palm with what revolves; and there are similar holes on the two other pieces of wood as well.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tie the ligaments which you have tied in the chest of the sick one at the bandage that is at his head; and tie the ligaments which you have tied in his legs at the bandage that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then let the attendant be at every bandage, who twists his hand with the linen, by which the bandage is twisted; and the physician presses on the spondyle, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of the bandage that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then after the spondyle returns and the place is pressed, then it is necessary that you put an ointment of dry plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then apply a poultice (stuppa).
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then put above the ointment a star-shaped patch from wood, whose width is three fingers, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length should be such as to contain the hollow of the back, and on the healthy part of the spondyle.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it is tied with the ligament that I have mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And the sick one shall eat delicate food until he gets better.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If anything remains elevated in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the administration of the tablet that I have mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now the lead sheet (lamina plumbi) is administered to him.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 And sometimes there remains an elevation at the last spondyle of the back; and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that bone which has now protruded.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, it is not necessary for this medicine to be assumed without caution; for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 Chapter on the cure of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 You know that the joints of the ankle and shoulder do not occur except in dislocation; nor does it occur to them what occurs to the other joints due to slight displacement and hollowing.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 And indeed, the joint of the Ancle is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 It is because it is dislocated to the anterior and to the posterior.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 Furthermore, it is mostly dislocated internally: it is less dislocated to the anterior and to the posterior.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 And the treatment for the internal dislocation is: because when you join the weak leg with a healthy one, it is longer: and its knee is more protruding than that of a healthy person, and the weak cannot double his foot near the groin: and there is a place following the groin which is pressed with a hot poultice, for this reason, because the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 And the sign of an external dislocation is that its symptoms are opposite to these symptoms (internal dislocation).
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 And the sign of an anterior dislocation is that it stretches out the healthy leg to a certain extent: but it does not double without pain in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot move forward over it: and his urine is retained, and his groin is pressed, and while walking, his foot is stepped on at the calcaneum.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 And the sign of a posterior dislocation is that it does not stretch out the knee nor can it double before doubling the groin: and its leg is even shorter than the other: and his groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place (of the wound).
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 However, the reduction of this dislocation is to consider at that time if the dislocation is old, which has already become chronic with the one who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then, if you administer the reduction and it remains according to its own position: then there is no cure at all (in that case).
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, do not presume too deeply upon him (the patient).
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In that case where dislocation is recent, and it belongs to one of the four types of dislocations: then hasten to do this, that you press the joint, and extend it towards inside and outside, and move it right and left: perhaps it returns, and does not need other care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If it does not return by this means, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong helper and he extends the leg from its lower part: either with his hands, or with a rope which is tied above the knee: and another helper extends the hand thus that he introduces his hands under the fingers.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then bind it gently with a rope around the root of the hip and hold the other end of the rope.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And let the extension be either from the front of the groin to the breastbone, or from the back to the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And let the extension of all (the limbs) be one, until the weak one with his body is lifted off the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 And this kind of extension is a common type among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If therefore the dislocation returns as we said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary in every case to do what I will say about its treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the reduction of its own kind (of dislocation), when it is towards the inside, it is necessary that the weak one lies on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then put the rope around the root of the hip where it is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the rope from the lower part of the groin to the upper part of the body, to the breastbone.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then let another strong helper take his arms and make a narrow place in the large part of the weak hip and extend it with a strong extension towards the outside.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now, indeed, it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this is one of the simpler species of cure, by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If, however, it is excised above you and does not obey you to enter with this species of cure entirely: then it is necessary that two weak feet be tied together with a strong ligament, soft, on both heels and on both knees: and let the length of each one be four fingers' width apart from its origin: and let the leg be weakly extended by more than twice the length of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then, the weak one is suspended above the head of a post, which is in the house: and let its length from the ground be two forearms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to guard the head of the hip: and suspend another with the weak one: and push another youth, guarding the hip with strength, for it returns to its place quickly with union.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In its reduction, however, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the weak one lie on a platform, as we said in the one with humpback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And bind a ligament over its leg, the weak one's own, and over its chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then, two posts are placed, one at his feet, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then a post is placed in the middle of the platform, fixed well: over which are wrapped wet cloths, so as not to harm the weak one: and let the post be between his hips, so that it is not drawn downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then, let every servant go to his place, and the doctor equalizes the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If it, therefore, obeys for reversal, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place it on the table and press it equally, as we said in humpback.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 The sick one should lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 If the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary to extend the sick person's leg quickly; and according to this same account on a stool; and let the doctor place the palm of his right hand on the sick person's hip.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then bend him with one hand, and while bending place him extended to below towards the knee part.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 If the dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary to extend the sick one below; and he should be raised on the ground: instead he should be placed on a hard surface, as it is also necessary if his shoulder is dislocated towards the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two sides: and it is on his face, and the ligaments are extended; according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 It is necessary to administer compression with a board also on the place from which it goes out joining, when reduction is completed according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you; and it is that you extend two legs of the sick one; and when you see them equal, and the sick one tightens his leg, and opens himself without hesitation; then you know that the limb has returned, according to what is necessary: then join the hips, and place an ointment, and tie with a bandage, that is, a roller; so that the shoulder does not move to any part; and let the sick one remain quiet for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then loosen the ligament, the ointment, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation is already fixed; therefore release the sick one for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 If you see something softening: then return, and apply the ointment, and bind it according to your first tightening; and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then dissolve it and make him slow in walking on both sides for a few days until he recovers well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 On Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The leg gets dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It gets dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and to below (or behind), namely, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And a sign of this dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 But if it does not adhere to the hip: then you know that the leg is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all the modes of this dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he can now extend his leg if he can over it, and let his back touch his face; and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then let the patient's leg adhere to your palms, and straighten them out over the leg.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply with your palm both sides of the leg forcefully.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another servant extends his foot, until the leg returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 And a sign of restoration is that the leg adheres with the hip gently, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then apply plasters to it and let the patient's leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then unbind them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And the patient should not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 But if the reduction is refused by him, then administer a strong extension with bindings, whose method of application has been previously mentioned in the treatment of the ankle, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 Section on the treatment of calcaneal dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The calcaneus is sometimes removed by a small removal, and sometimes dislocated according to its completeness.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 And the dislocation of it [the calcaneus] occurs either towards the internal parts or towards the external parts.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 And the sign of its [calcaneus's] dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen, proceeding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The cure of its [calcaneus's] removal is easy return: and it is to stretch it with ease by hands, and equalize it until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 In the treatment of it [calcaneus] when dislocated according to its completeness, it is necessary that you make the sick man sit upright: and the strong servant should hold him tightly from behind the middle part of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold it [the foot] with your right hand from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of its foot, in the place of the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then with your left hand take hold of it from both sides.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then extend [the foot] with the left, and push the heel of the foot with the right turned towards the calf without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do this twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the heel of the foot towards the calf with your third effort, and you pull on the ankle.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If it returns in one or two efforts according to this method, and you see the foot equalized, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on him, because it will return by itself.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If the return of it [calcaneus] is prevented by him [the patient], when we have said this, then make the sick man lie on his back on the ground, and fix a peg in the ground firmly, so that he falls between his thighs: and you should already have wrapped him in cloth, so as not to harm the sick man.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then let the servant take his hip: afterwards let another servant extend the foot, either with his hands, or with a strap that binds over the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Let every servant extend himself against the stretching device set up for him: let a peg be standing between the hips of the sick man to keep him from being drawn downwards towards the stretching device.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands, and another servant holds the sound leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 For a dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When the dislocation has returned and is declared to you as healed, then place ointment and wool, and bind it tightly with bands, and bind the foot with a strap to the sound leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And you must be careful or fear the nerves that are above the heel bone at the back, so that the strap is not too tight and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then dismiss him for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the strap becomes soft, bind it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and prevent the sick man from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 But if he attempts to walk before that period, there is no security except that the dislocation may burst open again and be spoiled, and not receive treatment afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If he has a hot abscess, then it is necessary that you administer to him the sedative mentioned earlier in another part of our treatment, and embrocation until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Chapter on Dislocations of the Fingers of the Foot, and Treatment.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that it be adjusted which has been dislocated with slight extension without difficulty; this indeed is easy rather than difficult.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 But if the dislocation is in certain knuckles of the foot, then it is necessary that the sick man sit with his foot on a level place or table; and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and place your foot upon that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then you press it with your foot with force until it returns and you see that it is now even, and no projection appears at the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then put under the sole of his foot a flat board which can hold the whole foot, having two feet.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind it with a bandage fitting well for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then unbind it and let it rest from walking for many days, until bound and secured from any recurrence of the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 [Paragraph] On types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something happens to it (i.e., the fracture or dislocation), and you attempt its treatment and restoration, death often occurs repeatedly; therefore, one should not presume to undertake such a cure unless he is wise in long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous. Moreover, he should use only medicines that calm the pain with warm applications, and he should leave the weak one to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for healing from destruction with mildness of disease, and where there is something that suggests hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore, attempt the reduction of it immediately at the beginning, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the limb therefore returns as we wish, then administer a regime that calms the abscess; and care for the wound with whatever is suitable to it from dry ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and separate sequestra occur in the bone, then attempt to remove them; and do in this what was said for simple diseases at the places where they were found.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be careful according to your strength and guard yourself from entering into the path of fear; according to what my previous teaching has taught you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 That is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more healthy for your body among them in your time.
