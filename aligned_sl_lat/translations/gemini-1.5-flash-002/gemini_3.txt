After I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its completion, and I have reached the end of it, from its expositions and its declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Because manual operation has been neglected in our region and time, completely abandoned: until perhaps its science has perished, and its trace has been cut off: and there have remained of it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered: and error and hesitation have befallen them, until its intentions have been closed, and its force has been weakened: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise on it according to the way of exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation: and that I should come with the forms of the instruments of cautery, and other instruments of the work: as it is done from the addition of declaration, and from the hastening of that which is necessary.
The reason why a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in this our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised in it before that in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the aids of the limbs, and their forms, and their conjunction, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their egress, and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their exit.
And because of that Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We indeed already said about that in the introduction of this book.
Because he who is not knowledgeable of what we said about anatomy is not freed from falling into error, by which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge, and without experience.
That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut an scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries in the neck: wherefore the blood of the woman flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man, who was advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Therefore he arrived at it, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received payment from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture above the wound with cushions and splints with a strong binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he discharged him according to his wishes.
Afterwards he dismissed him after a few days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained so until his leg and his foot became suppurated, and it came to loss.
Therefore I was called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and calmness followed, and he escaped from his pains.
Nevertheless, the corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who perforated a cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated afterwards, until its malignancy was magnified with its lord.
That is, because when a cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a member which can tolerate that its whole is cut away.
And for that reason, O Sons, it is necessary for you to know that manual operation is divided into two divisions: namely, operation with which is associated safety: and operation with which there is danger in many situations. And I have already warned in every place of this book, where operation comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to avoid that, and to leave it: so that fools may not find a way to speak, and to dishonor.
Therefore take measure with care and protection, and your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to salvation and laudable success: and leave terrible illnesses of difficult healing: and lift your spirits from that which makes you fear, lest hesitation enter upon you in your faith and your well-being. For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your rewards.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness: lest you be called bad physicians.

Part I.
Concerning the benefit and harm of cautery: and to which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron or gold.
Chapter I.
But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms: and in which complexion it should be exhibited.
Therefore I say that the discussion of the quality of the benefit of cautery and its harm is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a science, and a hidden secret.
Many wise men have also spoken on it, and they have disagreed: and indeed a little from their discussions suffices me, fearing prolixity.
Therefore I say that cautery universally benefits every complexion which is with matter and without matter, except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter and the dry complexion without matter.
However, in the hot and dry complexion with matter, they disagreed.
For some have said that cautery is beneficial in it.
And others said the opposite of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in illness which is from heat and dryness: because the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness should be healed with hot and dry.
And he who says the opposite of that said: that through cautery help is given in every hot and dry illness which happens in the bodies of men: because when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I indeed say through his words: because experiment has already revealed that to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that he come to that, except he who is already proven and practiced in the chapter of cautery by ultimate exercise, and has known the diversity of the complexions of men, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their duration.
From the other complexions however, there is no fear for you: and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For already all physicians have agreed on them: and they did not disagree in helping with cautery in them.
And know, sons, that from the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine is: because fire is simple, whose action does not arrive except at the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined with it, except with small harm.
But the action of burning medicines arrives at that which is distant from the members: and perhaps it causes in the member an illness of difficult healing, and perhaps it kills.
Fire however, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Now indeed that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I excuse myself from length of speech.
And know, sons, that they disagree in the time in which it is fitting to make cautery, and they place the better time in spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times: therefore, because harm happening because of time is submerged in the help which is drawn with cautery.
And especially if cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness: because it is feared from them that harm may happen which is greater than the small harm entering because of time.
And let not that fall into your minds, O sons, which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely that that illness which is healed by cautery does not always return: and they put that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cautery is nothing but a medicine in place which alters the complexion, and dries the humors which are the causes why pains happen.
However, cautery surpasses medicine in the speed of its health, and the strength of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the complexion of the infirm, and the location of his illness, and its strength: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and what arrives at it in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from causes, unless the illness in which cautery is administered occurs. An illness subtle in a member of few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth, because of pain, and similar things to it, for it is possible that that pain may not return in it.
But that happens in few cases.
But truly the speech of the common people again, that cautery is the last of medicines, is right speech: not to that which they intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure which can be compared with medicine, nor with anything else after the setting of the cautery.
But the matter is contrary to that, and the intention that cautery is the last of medicine is not, except that when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it helps: then it follows that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
But the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron: and they did not say that, except because of the evenness of gold, and the excellence of its substance: and they said that the place of cautery does not produce pus. That is not true absolutely: because I have already proved it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Nevertheless, when you heat a cautery in the fire made of gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the amount you want, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches cold, and if you add more heating to it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Therefore the craftsman falls from it into difficulty: and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and more readily available to us, because of its suitability for the operation.
And I indeed have now arranged this Chapter on Cautery, according to chapters: and I have arranged them from head to foot: so that they may alleviate the search for what one wants from it. Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization contributes to the control of humidity and coldness in the brain: which two are causes of headache, and an abundance of the flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and excessive sleep, and toothache, and sore throat: and universally every illness which arises from coldness, such as paralysis, and headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the patient: that he be evacuated first with a cleansing purgative medicine for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, and his age, and his habit.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands squarely, so that he has now placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever therefore your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink. Then heat the olive cautery: its form is this. Then place it on the place marked with ink, descending, so that your hand is gradually tightened, and you will roll it.
Then quickly lift your hand, and look at the place.
But if you see now revealed from the bone a quantity of the head of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherbi, then lift your hand.
And if not, repeat with your hand the same iron, or with another if it cools; until you see the bones which I told you about.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cautery in it, and put it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Then put on it the cautery soaked in butter, and leave it on the place, until the fire eschar is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits; wherefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then shave what has been burnt from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate with the cautery, until it makes a strong impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which is done like the form of kirate: or the instrument that women place in a small infusion of letters: and they think that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it is consolidated.
But to me these two types of cautery do not seem at all suitable except in certain men according to the way of fear.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with its safety.
For the head is weakened by the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other members: and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally weak: and indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore work with it safely.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head: and it is prolonged in the patient, and he uses bloodlettings, and cuppings, and purgatives for the head, and oils, and cataplasms.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things benefits him: then consider.
For if the patient's head is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery a little below that one.
Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, until the skin is pierced, and a quantity of bone, which we have described, is uncovered.
And cauterize him with one cautery in the occiput of his head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed: and raise your instrument in this, and do not uncover the bone.
For the patient finds a very intense pain because of it, and different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
And I shall call this cauterization in its place: and it is necessary that the cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized be used, and the occiput of it with a more delicate cautery than that with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with a caustic medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment which I have described in the divisions of illnesses is administered, and all this does not help: then cauterization is used in it according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine: or with iron. Now cauterization with a sharp burning medicine is as follows: take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from two sides.
Then incise the place of the pain at the time with a broad phlebotomy knife, until a space is made under the skin in which the clove can be placed.
Then insert it under the skin, until it is hidden; then bind over it with a suitable compress, and leave it for fifteen hours; then unbind it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterwards apply a cloth soaked in butter to it until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish to do it with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, On Burning Medicines.
Cauterization however with iron is in this manner.
A fire cautery, whose form is this.
And it is called a nail, because the form of its head is like the form of a nail, in which there is a certain curve, and in the middle of it there is a certain small prominence.
Then place it on the spot and hold your hand; and you slowly turn the iron quickly; and let the quantity that is burned be of the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
And raise your hand, so that the artery which is below is not burned, and a flow of blood does not happen.
Then soak a pledget in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then place a pledget with butter; afterwards treat with ointment until it is healed. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cultellar extremity of the Cautery.
And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not the old one properly.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in an old hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When you treat a hemicrania with what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we have said is not sufficient, from the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, then it is necessary that you heat the cultellar cautery until it becomes white after you mark on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost that: and place your hand at once, and squeeze it until you cut the artery, and reach to the bone. However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves in mastication, lest the side be burned, or the nerve which moves it, from which a spasm may result.
And be watchful and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut.
For in its incision there is danger, and especially to him who ignores what he does, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he leaves the operation with it in the first place.
And I will come with a recollection of the regime of the flow of blood happening from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial. Concerning the method of cauterizing in earache.
Chapter VI. When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with resolvents and the other treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire; and this is what is called a point, whose form is this.
Then prick with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it is rolled around; or around both, if the pain is in both at the same time.
And move the cautery away from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with a cautery; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points in each ear, and about that.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a twisted [condition].
Chapter VII.
The twisted condition which is treated with cauterization is only from the species which happen from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses. And avoid cauterization of the species which happens from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this species of twisted condition with bleedings, and purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the afflicted person with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little lower than its temple, and a third at the joining of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the afflicted part.
Because softening does not happen except in the part which appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the end of the upper ear under the horn of the head a little: and another in the temple: whose length is according to the length of a thumb.
And place your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, whose form is shown above; however, it is not a little thinner than that, as you see: and it is necessary that there be a knife in it of slightly superfluous thickness. Then treat the places with what preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cautery in the occiput of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of cauterization should be according to what preceded.
Also, cauterization is done with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is more extreme.
Then let him be treated with what preceded.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Oblivion.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that in the beginning, great hyssop and pills purifying the brain be given to the sick person in drink.
Then shave the whole head of the sick person, and place upon his occiput a plaster of mustard described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times. For this is the method of cauterization: and do it according to the same order which I described there. If therefore he is healed by it, it is good.
If not: then make for him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Then treat the cauterizations, with that which preceded.
But if you wish an addition, and the patient is able to tolerate it: then make for him a cauterization in the middle.
But if you wish an addition: then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him, until he is healed: and let the cauterization be olive-shaped according to the form which was previously described.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hyssop, and with that which we have said.
Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery above each horn of the head, and with a cautery behind it, and with three above the vertebrae of the neck.
But if in the illness you need more softening of the body than those, and the patient is able to tolerate it, and the illness is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery, until much of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Then take care of him until he is healed: and thus cauterize with olive oil.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless his epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the other treatment which we mentioned in the division: when the patient is large, or is tolerant in receiving medicines.
But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and mouthwashes cleansing the brain are administered beforehand for many days, with improvement of diet.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another cautery in his occiput, and above each horn of his head with a cautery.
But if the patient is strong and is tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned in the case of one having paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded. But if the patient is a child, then apply a thin cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in melancholia.
Chapter XII.
When the cause of melancholia is corrupt humours and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we mentioned in the case of one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined to melancholia, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him something to drink that will cleanse his brain, as preceded in the division: then shave the head of the patient, and afterwards make a properly made compress of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting squarely should be held on every side.
Then present the liniment. And it is more worthy from old sheep butter.
And heat it over a fire with a moderate measured heat, which a finger can tolerate when put into it.
Then empty it in the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this for the patient once every week, with the rest of his good regime, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it making very many small points of it, except that you hold your hand with the cautery: indeed it is by smelling.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with a quality.
Then place on it a pledget soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I mentioned in the division, then begin and purge the patient with that which cleanses his head.
And guard him from all dampness, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him over the two temples with two cauteries, if the beginning of the descent of water is in both eyes simultaneously; or from one side, if the beginning of the water is in one eye: and cut off with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
But if you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and caution from the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries ultimately produced.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old tears.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are old, constant: and are upon the veins and arteries which are in the exterior manifest part of the head, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I narrated in the beginning of the descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries upon the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
And if you need an addition, then cauterize it on every cautious side of the eye, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in nasal stench.
Chapter XV.
When you treat it with what we said in the division, and the medication does not help: then hasten, and give the patient  infirmocochias to drink for three nights: then shave his head, and cauterize it with a middle cautery, with an olive cautery.
Then cauterize it with a nail cautery, with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the form of the nail cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not move your hand with the cautery, but according to the amount which burns a third of the eyelid.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted, pricking the eye. Chapter XVII.
Cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.
In cauterization with fire, however, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who remove them, until they grow long and are equal. But if they prick him at their root, then bind his eyes with a fillet so that they do not move until they grow.
When therefore they have grown and are equal, then place the patient's head in your bosom; then mark upon the eyelid of his eyes with a cautery, a mark which is according to the figure of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a pledget soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage upon the eye.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Then cauterize over the mark which you made gradually in many times, until the surface of the skin is burnt, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, entirely appearing properly.
And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contract, and the hairs rise up at the puncture of the eye.
Raise your hand then and leave it for three days.
Then put on it a pledget with butter until the eschar is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some of the hairs return after a time, and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that place, as you did at first.
But if the hairs are below, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
It is to instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even.
Make from paper or cloth a myrtle leaf shape.
Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, one ounce of each or thereabouts; then grind them together well and quickly, so that it does not cool.
Then spread it on the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids.
And place under the eye a pledget soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be on your breast.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently.
And you shall move it whenever the patient feels the medicine biting; for its bite feels like fire.
While therefore the biting sensation persists, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised by cautery with fire, or with incision, it is well: and if not, then apply more of the medicine to the place where the medicine does not penetrate and does not blacken, until your operation is even, and the eye is contracted.
Then place a pledget with butter on it, until the burnt skin is eradicated.
Then treat it with diaphnic ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you during the operation, that you observe the greatest care, lest anything of the medicine fall into the eye.
But if the eyelid softens afterwards, and something fights against the hairs in the eye, then apply the medicine again to that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did in the beginning.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Therefore, let your consideration be according to that: and the way of rightness is not hidden from him who studies this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a lachrymal fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help: then, it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to put his head in your bosom, and let a servant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it is not moved, nor shaken with his head.
Then place a cotton pledget soaked in egg white or in flaxseed mucilage over his eye; then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish it to be upward, try it so.
Nevertheless, this concave [cautery] is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
And hold with your hand for a little while near the cautery away from the eye, toward the side of the nose, so that your hand does not stray, or the patient is disturbed: and you shall place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If therefore you arrive at the bone with the beginning of your cautery, it will be well.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if you need it: and leave it for three days.
Then apply a pledget with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed. But if forty days have passed, and it is not healed: then place upon it a sharp corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which certain early authors mentioned.
Apply to the place of the fistula, and incise it: then place in the incision a fine tube, that is, a slender cannula, whose form is this.
And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of molten lead, and hold your hand with good retention of the cannula, and let the patient not move at all, lest the molten lead run, or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye a compress soaked in egg white, or in water.
For the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
If the fistula is healed with what we have said, by cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to treat the opening of the nose, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come in its own proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing fissures of the lips.
Chapter 20.
Fissures, which are called chaps, often occur on the lip, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, with what we said in the division of illnesses, and the treatment does not help, then you should make a small cautery with fire, according to this method.
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then treat it with cerate until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula of the mouth.
Chapter 21.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth; then it forms pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus flows, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to apply a cauterizing iron according to the size which the fistula will contain.
Then insert the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and its end; do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards with what we have said concerning treatment until it is cured.
If then the pus is cut away and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the corrupt bone according to what will come into its head.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the gums and softened teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum is softened because of humors, and the teeth are moved, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then a fire cautery, whose form will come after these things, so that you place a cannula upon the tooth: and quickly insert the ignited cautery into it: and hold your hand a little while, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Then let the sick person fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
For the moved tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt humor is dried.
Chapter 23.
When the toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in it, and treatment with medicines does not help: then cauterization is appropriate in two ways: either cauterization with butter or cauterization with fire.
Now cauterization with butter is done as follows: take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a small pan.
Then take a tent and wrap it around the end of a probe.
Then dip it in the boiling butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or a tent in cold butter and apply it to the aching tooth; and place a heated iron on top of it until the heat penetrates to the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterization with fire is done by using a bronze or iron tube. And let there be something in its body of some thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, whatever shape it may be, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either that same day or another.
And it is necessary in the impression of that cautery that the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, as is possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in strumae.
Chapter 24.
When strumae are from phlegm and from cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion through medicines, and you wish their digestion quickly: then a concave cautery of fire, whose shape is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may exit from the cautery at the other end: and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time, if you need it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
But if the abscess is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it lint infused in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth unguent, until the shape of a tube is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in hoarseness of voice, and constriction of breath.
Chapter XXV.
When humors overcome the lung passage, and especially when it is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the infirm person be evacuated first with solutive medicines.
Then cauterize it in the uvula near the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware, lest you reach with the cautery to the throat, nor into the skin, except a little of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the juncture of the neck in the last vertebra of it, perfecting it: and let the cautery be nail-shaped according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in illnesses of the lung and cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and illness of the lung are from cold humors, and the infirm one has neither fever nor consumption, and the illness is of long standing: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the furcula in places depressed, soft, and empty.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be of a tube according to the form which preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, which is called a Point, whose form preceded in the puncturing of earache: and let the points be from thirty points up to about others.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore the cauterization is alleviated with it, when you do with it at one time three cauterizations.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the armpit, in the dislocation of the shoulder.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated because of humidity, and it is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation first.
Then the patient is laid on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then lift the skin which is in the inner armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then have a cautery with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will be with four cauteries.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the figure of the cauterization then is of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the probe.
And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added to this manner, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place on the cautery crushed leeks with salt.
Then make the patient adhere to stillness, so that the limb is not moved for some time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a nail-shaped cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it away from its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied in it, and the methods of treatment are continuous, and it does not help: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the breastbone the size of one finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on the two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And separate them from each other so that they do not join, when they produce pus. And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this is done be one according to the shape of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for someone who is frightened by this cautery: and it is so that you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity which you wish with a hot iron: then cauterize it with a pointed cautery: then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and dampness, or from gross flatulence, until it departs from its natural complexion by superfluous egress, and the infirm person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the infirm person be laid supine upon his neck, and mark with a hot iron three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity upon the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the elbow of a man reaches: and let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight body: and do not compress your hand with the cautery very much.
And let the quantity of what is burned be from the thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it not added: and let the infirm person stand upon his feet.
But if he is not standing, then let him be lying, who now extends his legs and raises his arms. This is the form of the cautery.
And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware lest you proceed to the end in cauterization, and the thickness of the whole skin is burned, wherefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
Chapter 30.
When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient is afflicted by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is intense, sharp pain; and you see now that its treatment has fatigued its physicians.
Therefore, the patient should lie on his back.
Then mark the location of the abscess with a cautery; then heat a cautery that resembles a ray.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it one cautery, until the whole skin is burned, and it reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment of exits, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery, except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged; and through whose hands these sicknesses occur with experience several times: then indeed let him dare such an operation.
But truly, to leave it, is better with me.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said, cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy in this manner.
And it is, that you receive of the dried roots of birthwort, one longer root, which is found among them, and let it be like the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil: and ignite it in the fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the clavicle with the neck, and with two small cauteries below the chin slightly sloping towards the part which is under the beard.
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib sloping slightly towards the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades: and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be evident on the skin by smelling. And now some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron similar to a ray: and they ignite it, and internally send it into that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess with it, and pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no cure.
Chapter XXXII. On the method of cauterizing the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, with what we have said about treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then cautery is used in it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
One of which is that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line according to the length of the spleen, according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, the figure of which preceded.
And let there be between each cautery the amount of the thickness of a finger, or a little more.
And let the method of cautery be, as we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient be lying on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you burn with a cautery having two prongs, which we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and raise the skin which is in the direction of the spleen, where the left elbow of the patient reaches: and let your elevation, with which you raise the skin, be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them; then withdraw the cautery: therefore four cauteries are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then take care of the cautery after you release it, that it emits pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than all the other things which preceded from the treatment.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
Cautery does not fall in dropsy, except for ascites specifically.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we have described in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and two cauteries on the back between the vertebrae, and one in the region of the chest, and another in the region of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be approximately the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it emits pus for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment after cauterization with it: for it is necessary that two intentions be combined for him: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped: according to what preceded its form; and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-shaped according to what preceded its form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs. Chapter 34.
When abscesses form in a dropsical patient and are filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize on the dorsum of the foot in the space between the little and ring fingers; and raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
Then the yellowish water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below that, about the middle of the leg; and on each hip two cauteries; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may sweat out from it; then treat it with the other things which we have mentioned.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in looseness of the bowels. Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and humors, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with methods of treatment and is not healed, and you see the patient tolerating cauterization of exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, as preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and with four small cauteries around the navel, with a thin nail-like cautery; and with a large cautery over the alcatin above the alhosos, or with two cauteries.
And if you see exuberant humors, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery over the pubis, and with a cautery over each ilium; and perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupt humors, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower vertebra of the back under the flank somewhat triangularly, and with a cautery below the navel as if by two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face become inflamed, then cauterize him above the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize above his liver, and another above his spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you cut away althelul, then heat a cautery that is similar to a ray.
Then insert it, burning, into the excised althelul: and with the last of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice. If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have related.
Then treat them with what suits them of ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more effective in aid.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38.
When the patient does not submit to the incision and operation which we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he may be cured with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and becomes old, pus and corrupt humors flow from it.
Therefore, it is more fitting that you should probe it with a thin probe.
Then ascertain the amount of its depth with a probe.
Then heat a cautery which is similar to a ray.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula and the amount that the nail entered. And repeat the cautery over it until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
And guard yourself from burning a nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then care for the place until it heals.
But if the place is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time: then know that it is now completely healed.
And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is a corrupted bone, or something like that from those: the mention of which will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Chapter 39.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from thick wind, and the patient's strength is diminished because of it, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen on the kidneys themselves, cauterizing over each kidney with a nail-shaped cautery, the mention of which has preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almeidatu itself.
Therefore three lines will result.
Therefore the last ones will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter 40. When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and moisture, until the infirm person no longer retains urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the pubis above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and cauterize from the right side of the pubis and also from the left: and let the length of that lateral cauterization be according to the size of the thumb's joint; and cauterize it with a cautery of the lower back, or with two cauteries, if you need it: and let it be according to what preceded, a claviform cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb. Chapter 41.
When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is prevented by that from impregnation, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain happens to her at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the pubis on the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be claviform.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the rectum in dislocation.
Chapter 42.
When mucous humors are poured out to the cavity of the rectum, and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of that is, that one leg is lengthened over the other, when they are compared together: and the place of dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the cavity of his rectum with a cautery similar to a circle: after you mark with a hot iron around the cavity, as it is rolled: and that the cavity itself fall in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
But if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the whole skin.
Then take care of him, until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in sciatica. Chapter 43.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its causes are cold and dampness: and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary that you resolve the patient from gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is, that you cauterize above the hip joint with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them a good, or a bad, depth.
And let the space which is between each cautery be the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle above the head of the hip joint.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, the form of which preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, with one: so that there is a circle containing the whole hip.
And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place to which the sick person points there, in which there is pain, and with your cautery above the shin four fingers towards the outer part a little: and let the cautery be knife-shaped. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a pointed cautery, three, or four, or more, if it needs that.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-shaped cautery.
And beware in all your cauterization, that you do not go so far with the cautery as to burn a nerve, or a large artery, and draw upon the sick person through that a great harm, or contraction.
And I indeed have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in cauterization, and the leg was swollen, until the swelling reached the foot, and it was wholly perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there happened a bursting of the belly, and death after that.
But if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men have said concerning the cauterization of the hip, of which cautery this is the method.
Make a similar iron cautery, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date-stone, or somewhat less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space which is between each cautery be the quantity of a thumb-joint: and let the cauteries be open on two sides: and let their height be about a joint, or two joints: and make for them a handle of iron decently fitted to the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the hip-joint, the patient lying on his sound side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave him for three days.
Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, "My son, we have used this type of cautery little, because of the terror of its appearance: and therefore, because we have found few who would endure it.
However, it is one of the good cauteries for him who endures it, and finds with it its place.
The cautery, however, with burning medicines is as follows: you make two samia having a perforated ring, into which descends a hinge of its gate of bronze, or iron, the length of the wall: in the height of which there are two knots, or something like them.
And let the space which is between both be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let that which contains them be joined together, according to this form.
Then place it over the hip socket, the patient lying on the healthy side.
And press your hand very much upon the hip socket.
Then pour between the two circles some warm water, which has been heated a little with fire, and hold it for the amount of an hour: and let the patient tolerate its biting and burning, for he will find the biting like fire, until the biting ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the whole hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it, until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will flow from it.
For it is the last in aid.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the pain extends to the hip or leg: make him sit in that which contains water, according to what you did to the hip equally.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and quicklime, one part of each: grind both, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that the ray may enter: and put under the bottom of the pot another glass pot: and pour over the alkali and lime fresh water, which submerges both by a finger's breadth: after which you compress them with your hand with good pressure: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over other lime: and filter it until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strong in sharpness, which is used in many medical operations, and in cauterizing other members.
Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And among medicines are those with which ankles are cauterized, also such as tesisie, and cashew-nut oil, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen indeed, in narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from antiquity, by which he was cured of hip pain and sciatica: and he magnified it to be very good.
And he said that he did not need another cure, and that he was healed in one time, until he recounted that he perhaps entered a bath carried, and came out of it already healed. And it is so that it is taken from green setaragi: and if green is not found, let dry, fresh be taken: and let it be ground much with some fat, and let it be placed on the hip, where the pain is, or leg, or in the thigh: and let it be bound, and let it remain for the amount of three hours, or for the amount of time that the sick person feels a lessening of the burning.
Then introduce him into a bath.
When therefore his body becomes dewy, introduce him into the bath.
For the pain recedes, and it is healed.
And know that it is not necessary that anyone use a cautery with these medicines, except after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides also said that goat dung, when the sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and the cautery is done in this way.
Let wool be taken, and let it be soaked in old oil, and let it be placed upon the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle, and is nearer to the ankle.
Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Then repeat it.
Therefore do not cease doing this, until sensation reaches the middle as far as the ankle, and the pain ceases.
And this method of cauterization is called vaccinum cauterization.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Chapter 44.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter; and cauterization indeed is not appropriate except in this type alone, which is caused by the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with foul-smelling pills and the like, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the almond itself, after marking with a branding iron five cauteries in each line, or more according to the amount which comes from the patient's tolerance and strength: and the cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a nail-shaped cautery in the middle, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in incipient gibbosity.
Chapter XLV.
This ailment often happens to small infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you will find in the last vertebra of the back and its nodules that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery which is circular according to this form.
And let the cautery take equally upon every part of the vertebra; and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two lines, or three: and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware lest you apply the cautery to a hump which is formed in a spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in gout and the pains of the joints. Chapter XLVI.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which are poured out into any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to name it gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is so that one cauterizes him after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Whose form is this.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
But if the pains ascend to the knees, or the other joints, and this happens many times, then cauterize it above each knee with three cauteries, or four on every side, with this same clavus-shaped cautery. If however more are necessary to you with this cautery, then cauterize it. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
But if the pains ascend to the knees and the back: then administer what we said of the cautery in its chapter.
But if the pains are in the hands only, then puncture around the wrists, as if two lines are rolled around.
But if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above every nodule a puncture, and above the comb of the hand.
But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not deprive the patient of good regimen, of the reception of medicines.
For if good regimen is done, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with God's help with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Chapter 47.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is beginning nearby: then it is necessary that you order the patient to omit eating on that day.
And that he use lenitives, so that stool descends from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back; and instruct him to hold his breath, until the bladder or intestine emerges or appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cautery under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which is of this form, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Then reduce the intestine or bladder to its cavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand over the place, so that the intestine does not come out; and you have now opened between the legs of the patient, and placed a cushion under him, and another servant over his legs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery over the mark, your hand with the cautery standing straight.
And hold it until you reach the bone with it; or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the bone with it at the first.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and that death or great harm befall the patient through it.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be thin, according to their size.
Then treat with the other ointments until it is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment for the length of time of his treatment, which softens his bowels: so that the intestine does not come out during straining and evacuation.
Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another forty days.
For when he uses this regimen, thus he is healed with a complete healing.
But when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be as a third of it.
Then treat him with that which we have said: and it will not increase.
And now some ancients have said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with a hot iron, and a line is placed which is across the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When pain occurs in some members from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help it, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of every member be according to its size, and its suitability, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it heals from the first cautery, it is good.
If not, then repeat the cautery on it.
Because it is customary for these pains to move from one member to that which is near it.
Therefore it is necessary that you pursue them with cautery until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Chapter 49.
Lepers, however, are sometimes helped by cautery with the greatest benefit.
And especially the type of leprosy which occurs because of the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you wish to cauterize it, consider.
If therefore the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it does not subside nor remain stationary: and you fear for the patient, that corruption will spread over his whole constitution: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, known, and a second below it towards the forehead at the edge of the hair, and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
And lastly apply your hand with the cautery lightly, until it impresses a small mark on the bone, and the splinters are removed from it: so that the emission of thick vapours from it may be relieved, and cauterize also with a cautery on the spleen itself, as has preceded.
But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient, and is clearly apparent: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head, and a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the haunch near the coccyx and one above it, in the same region: and two on the hips: namely on each hip one, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, of the joints of his fingers and toes: and cauterize on each heel of his feet, and the wrists of his hands.
And beware of the nerves which are on the back of the heel, so that you do not burn them. And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the pubic bone, and another on the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauterization you add, the more help it is, and the more beneficial.
And know that the patient does not find pain in cauterization, as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints, as preceded in the kinds of instruments.
Chapter L.
When a limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to what the size or smallness of the limb deserves.
And let your cautery penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes it is cauterized for some numbness which happens to the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Truly, let no one presume upon this except he who is wise in the anatomy of the limbs, and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Chapter 51.
When the albaras becomes chronic and nothing from the arts of medicine benefits it, then cauterize over it with a deep cautery a little, according to the amount of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with the flour of the herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: of each let there be one part; let these all be mixed, and spread upon a cloth, and applied to the place, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in cancer.
Chapter 52.
When the cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it is rolled.
The wise ones, however, have said that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the middle.
But it does not seem so to me; because I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen that many times. And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterizing in Albucasis.
Chapter LIII.
When someone has an abscess, and it is slow in maturing, either because of an excess causing it, or because of the patient's age, when he is aged and has little blood, or because of time, and one wishes to hasten the maturation of the abscess, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it itself will hasten with maturation.
But if you wish its perforation with a cautery, then a fire cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the abscess, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the patient, so that the flow of pus may be relieved.
Then take care of it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corroding ulcer. Chapter 54.
A corroding ulcer is nothing but a corruption in a limb that moves about and corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore if you see a corroding ulcer in a place which can tolerate cautery with fire, then have many fire cauteries, small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place in which the corroding ulcer is.
Then cauterize it on every side until you eradicate the whole corruption, and nothing at all of it remains. Then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil, until all the eschars and all the corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Therefore if you see that after three days flesh grows in a healthy growth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on that which remains of the corrupted places.
And a corrosive is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine.
For it arises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker help: and I indeed have already spoken of its cauterization with a sharp medicine in the division: therefore accept it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in nails and warts. Chapter 55.
This ailment often happens in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing, which harms the foot. And indeed cautery in them is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for that with fire, make a concave fire cautery similar to a vulture's feather: which is made of iron, according to the quantity that contains the nail on every side: and let it have thin edges.
Then place it, burning, upon the nail. Then roll the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus. Then plaster it with wild mallows, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it at night. For it itself will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the place with a flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
But if they are not converted, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply a cautery to them with warm water: and it is so that you take a tube of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather: and place it on the nail, or the althelul.
Then pour a small quantity of warm water into the tube: hold your hand, and you roll it with the pressure of your hand a little, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the nail, and the warm water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait a little for the biting of the warm water for one hour.
Then dismiss him, for the nail will be eradicated with its roots.
Do this with them one after another, until you come to all that are in the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
Chapter 56.
When tremor happens to someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, upon the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and upon his stomach a cautery.
For tremor rests with olive cautery, and the health of a cold illness hastens. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes foul things are expelled in the body, that is, pustules, which are made from gross corrupt matters.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary that they be cauterized above every head of the pustule with a fine cautery with myrtle wood, whose end is lit with fire.
Or with the root of long birthwort.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase; and the superfluity making them is broken, and they are healed from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Chapter 58. Often there occurs a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut in a wound, which happens externally, or in the incision of an abscess, or the cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to cut it off.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and press it strongly, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing comes out from it. Then put into the fire small olive cauteries, and many more large ones: and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place in which the artery is broken, and place the cautery upon the vein, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
But if [the blood] is expelled when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries which are prepared in the fire. Therefore do not cease doing this with one after another, until the blood is stopped.
And beware lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another harm befall the patient. And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the bleeding is stopped.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the bleeding is stopped. Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Or medicines with the property of stopping blood are placed upon it, and it is compressed with a suitable compress.
But he who manages its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the application of cauterizing agents, and the like, does not benefit him at all, except rarely.
But if this happens to someone, and no physician or medicine is present, then he should begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have related, and constricting it strongly, until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
And the finger should not be removed, pouring upon it constantly very cold water, until the blood clots and thickens, and is excised. And meanwhile he should consider what he needs of cautery or medicine.
End of the First Part.
Book of Surgery of Albucasis, Part II. Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds and similar things.
We have already said in the first chapter, every ailment in which cautery with fire and burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I placed chapters there from the head to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the seeker may be relieved of his search. And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter is something terrifying that is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, caution must be more vehement in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often happens, with which life stands in the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and things like these:  from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that which is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes there fall upon you in this art kinds of men with kinds of infirmities.
For among them is he who is enraged by his illness, and death is light to him: because of the vehemence of what he finds from his infirmity and the length of its malice.
And with illness is fear which signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his wealth, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious. Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be stronger than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything of it except after certain knowledge, which verifies with you that to which a laudable outcome has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your infirm, prognosis and indication of that to which health is suitably directed.
For in that is for you help in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not take from you direction and inspiration: for that is in his hand.
And I indeed have arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: that the thing which you wish from it, and which you need, may be lightened for you.
Concerning the treatment of water which gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this infirmity very often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife constricts the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this illness in others than in children; and death hastened to all whom I saw of them; therefore it seemed to me to omit an operation in it.
And indeed I saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit up by himself because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture is either collected between the skin and the bone, or collected under the bone upon the dura mater.
And the operation in it, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with one cut in width; and let the length of the incision be about two finger-breadths, until the moisture flows out.
And this is the shape of a spatula.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head opened on every side; and the water is depressed when you compress it with your hand inwards, and that is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this method.
And after the incision remove all the moisture.
Then moisten it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the binding, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound equally tightly.
And feed the patient with all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes it is greater in the occiput, or in the sinciput, or on the right, or on the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and the filling of water appear to you: and incise it as much as is possible for you.
And observe that you do not cut an artery, and that a flow of blood occurs, and that the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When catarrhs happen to someone in the eyes or in the chest, and it becomes chronic, and the treatment of medicines does not help: then the ultimate cure in this is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, the patient must shave his head.
Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Then let the patient tie his neck with any cloth of his.
Then consider where the vein pulsates.
And the locations of both are the depressed places which are behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain men.
Then mark with a cautery on each: and incise each with a sharp spatula on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and let this be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and incise it upwards with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
For when a vein is incised, blood flows out with a pulsating flow, which leaps inwards with a frequent leap.
But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers.
Then mark with a cautery, and cut down to the bone.
And that which it is necessary to let out of blood, is six ounces and perhaps you let out of it more, or less. All that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if something of the sifac remains at the bone, then incise it, lest a hot abscess occur: then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic headache, or acute catarrh due to acrimonious humors and heat in the temples, or chronic swelling and similar conditions, and he is treated with medical methods of healing and it does not help, then we have found in these illnesses that extraction of the arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described, is beneficial.
And the method of operating in their extraction is that the patient should shave the hairs which are in the temples, and stretch out the artery appearing in the temple.
For it is shown to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by the intensity of cold.
If it is hidden from you, then let the patient bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or steam the place with warm water until it appears to you manifestly. Then take a spatula, which I formed a little while ago. Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Then throw a hook into it, and pull it upwards until you pull it out of the skin, and make it escape from the tunics which are beneath it on every side.
But if the artery is small, then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Then cut from it a part according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and that a flow of blood does not happen.
For if it is not cut and if it is not severed, the blood does not fully ascend. Then evacuate blood from it six ounces, up to three.
But if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with double thread, strong, of silk or of alhod cords, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the healing of the wound, and a flow of blood happens.
Then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures.
Do this at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife-cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in the place of the same work.
And it is a better operation, unless the patient has a fever or is of a heated complexion.
Because cautery is among those things which help to end humidities.
Therefore it is a better help.
And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries that the place be filled with old cotton; and that properly made little cushions be placed upon it.
And after the separation it should be treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to grow, and with linen cloths, until it is healed.
But if meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi; and bind your hand until the blood is cut off.
But if none of these things is at hand, then place your finger on the place until the blood congeals.
And bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness ceases, and bind it as is necessary.
And of what is lighter and easier in the extraction of an artery, it is to cauterize a vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to an almond.
Nevertheless, they are of much less sharpness than two knives.
Because if they are sharp, like two knives, cold hastens to both: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this therefore the work is better than all work, and lighter, and easier.
And let the space that is between the two knives be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with a branding iron: and place both very hot, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities is lengthened.
For they do not completely consolidate with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Concerning the treatment of sharp, constant flow of tears from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When tears are constant, and their flow is from the veins which are on the outside of the skull, and nothing of medicinal treatment benefits them with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person already reddening, and he feels a crawling on his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are thinned, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with corrosion, and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients needed in their treatment this operation, and they named it treatment with the Knife.
And it is, that you should order the sick person to shave the hairs which are on his forehead.
Then incise three equidistant fissures in the forehead according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of the fissure be about two fingers, and one fissure be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the muscles, and the third from the other side; and beware of cutting the arteries which are on the two sides; and lengthen your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of each incision be the quantity of three joined fingers; and have ready for you a piece of prepared sponge, or much dried cloth, with which you will dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which the following is soon the form.
From the incision which is from the side of the temples, up to the second incision; and scrape with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, with the periosteum which is above the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh connected with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision be continued up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, press out the places of the clotted blood fragments. Then put into each fissure a pledget of old cotton, and place over them compresses soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the ligature, and administer a plentiful infusion with warm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs affecting the eyes from the interior of the head.
Chapter V.
When sharp, acrid, and persistent catarrhs occur to someone, and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their sight already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, hurting pain in the depths of the head, and sneezing follows: then understand from these occurrences that those materials and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
And the best treatment in these cases is this.
And it is that you order the patient to shave his forehead.
Then make in it one fissure in the middle of the forehead, or another a little wider, and begin with the fissure from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision reach the bone: and lengthen your hand from the temples’  branches, which move during mastication, until when the bone is uncovered: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the fissure with old linen, or with linen strips.
Then bind it above with powders: and moisten the powders with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you unbind it, and you see that the hot abscess is now diminishing: then it is necessary that you rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen which causes flesh to grow:  as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of rosin: and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ear. Chapter VI. Whatever falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar, and things similar to them; or some animal.
When therefore a stone, or a kind of stone from among those which are not added to, nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then instill into the ear something of violet oil, or sesame oil.
Then manage its extraction, and make him sneeze with sneezing powder, and block the nostrils at the approach of sneezing, after you place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upwards.
For very often it comes out with this treatment.
But if it does not come out, then manage its extraction with probes, that is, thin probes: whose form is this.
If therefore it comes out with probes, it is good.
And if not, then manage its extraction with a small, slightly hooked, blunt hook. If therefore it does not come out by that, then make a cannula of metal, and introduce the end of the cannula into the hole of the ear deeply, and plug that which is around the cannula with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for wind except through the cannula: then extract it with your strong suction. For very often it comes out with what we have narrated.
But if it does not come out in this way: then take some helkalimbat, or from birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it on the end of a probe after you have neatly wrapped a cotton ball around it: then introduce it into the hole of the ear easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incise, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is that the phlebotomist first bleeds the patient in the cephalic vein: and extract blood from him according to the measure of his strength.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fat in a depressed place there: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone: then remove it with what is possible for you of instruments.
Then sew up the incision quickly and treat it until it heals.
But if the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
But if it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin, fine spatula, according to this shape.
And administer with it the excision of that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do that when you think that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with a fine probe, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is alleviated.
In the case of water entering the ear, the infirm person should use sneezing with the head inclined forward: and he has already filled his ear with a little old cooked [food]: and he is lying on that ear in which is the water.
If therefore it exits through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, about the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the infirm person insert one of them into the opening of his ear: and let him stand on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Therefore let him not cease doing that with stone and stone, until all the water exits.
And now the water exits thus, that you take from a reed, or from a rush one, and insert one end of it into the ear: and ignite the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Then repeat another rush, and do this many times, until all the water exits: and draw it out with a tube as was said before in the case of the stone.
But in the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which is apparent to the senses: then manage its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its matter is easier than all things held in the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun.
If therefore something of worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with thin hooks.
But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the form, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates: then suck with it with strong suction.
Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
But if they do not obey you to come out, then stop up the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the case of a stone.
But if they do not come out with what we have said: then administer distillations which the ancients have already experienced in killing worms: and you will find that in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring out, with which you pour oils and medicines into the ear, be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As you see, make it of silver or bronze, narrower below, in which there is a small hole, wider above.
Therefore let that which pushes what is in the concavity of the cannula be made of bronze, decently made.
And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap cotton around its end with a decent wrapping: then pour oil, or juice, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the rod with the cotton on top, and press it with your hand with a moderate compression, until the oil is driven into the concavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear, should have been warmed a little with fire: and beware lest that which is distilled into it be very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
Concerning the treatment of the obstruction happening in the ear.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes some infants come forth from the wombs of their mothers not perforated.
And it has also happened to some men that there is an obstruction in the passage of the ear from a wound, or flesh grown in it.
And this obstruction sometimes happens in the depth of the opening of the ear, which sight does not reach; and sometimes it happens near the exterior of the opening, and sight reaches it.
Therefore that which happens in the depth of the ear, and which sight does not reach, is in most instances difficult of healing.
And in that which sight reaches, it is necessary that you place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look into it: then if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a thin spatula, of which the shape is this which follows, let its extremity in which there is a certain small width, a certain part of which is sharp: and let the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides: so that it does not injure the ear.
If therefore the obstruction is from flesh grown in the passage of the ear: then hold it with a thin hook, and cut it with strong ease, until all the flesh is removed.
But if the obstruction is in the depth of the ear: then take a thin, smooth probe, and heat it slightly with fire: then insert it into the passage of the ear.
If therefore you feel the obstruction with it, which the sick person finds with difficulty of hearing, try its opening with ease: and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a pledget according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Or take a pledget, and dip it in rose water, and sprinkle on it powdered vitriol, and use it.
But if you see the ear already suppurating: then it is necessary that you remove the pledget, and leave it with another pledget, which you will wrap in cerate made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides: then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs: then immerse a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the remaining treatment, which stops the flow of blood, as described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of a sty on the eyelid.
Chapter VIII. These styes which occur on the eyelids, are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary to grasp them with forceps: or with a hook, and to incise them with a spatula from their roots.
Then apply pounded verdigris to the site.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after incision.
For often they return when something remains of their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of hailstone-like growths of the eyelid.
Chapter IX.
It often happens in the eyelids that something similar to hail in its strength and hardness is found, and on account of this it is called hailstone: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you should then consider if it is a hailstone growing in it, which appears from the eyelid, and moves to every part, and its matter is easy.
Therefore make a fissure upon it in breadth.
Then scrape it from every part easily until it comes out.
Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
But if its excision is not prepared for you except after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision a little, then that harms the patient in something.
But if the fissure is large: then unite it with a suture: and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it, and makes flesh grow over it.
And if the hailstone slopes towards the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the hailstone with a hook: except that you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, that does no harm in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water: and treat the place with that which causes flesh to grow, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the axirnath of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is fat which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid: and it happens most to children: and it weighs down their eyes, and catarrhs happen to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them, and because of that you see them lying down on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, which an inflation has already covered: and the prominence of the Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person should put his head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare in it lint, and make from that lint a circle according to the quantity which contains the axirnath on every side.
Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on every side, so that the axirnath may collect in the middle of the circle.
Then make a cut in the middle of that moisture with a sharp-pointed instrument, the cuts being lengthwise, and let no cut be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you cut the skin entirely, until you arrive at the axirnath, for in many instances the axirnath proceeds from the fissure according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore draw it out with the cloth which you have inserted between your fingers to the outside: and you roll your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and beware lest you insert into the fissure, so that you do not arrive with the sharp-pointed instrument at the eye, and injure it.
But if the axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you shall add a little to the fissure with ease, until the axirnath comes forth.
Then draw it out, as we have said.
Then dip cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and bind it with powders.
And some men grind salt and put it in the hollow of the fissure, so that what remains of that moisture may be dissolved.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if it happens in a place of a warm abscess, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Concerning the ways of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whence it is wrinkled as it ought not to be.
Chapter XI.
When superfluous hairs are born in the eyelids beyond the course of the natural hairs, and grow: then they harm the eye, and cause various sicknesses, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and albugo, until it becomes a cause of destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was premised in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Or by tubes, according to what I shall say.
It is necessary that you put the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle into it, on which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let that be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a probe.
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula, cutting from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton, or cloth: then mark above the eyelid with a cautery, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because that already varies in people.
For there is one who needs to have a large amount cut from the eyelid, according to the amount that is softened from the eyelid. Then with a spatula incise along the two lines that you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a ray.
Then insert a hook into one of the two corners of the skin. Then flay it all. Then unite the two lips with a suture, with a needle and fine woolen thread: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what overflows from the threads over the two eyebrows, with some sticking things, if you wish to do that: and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days: afterwards treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts.
For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its union: but it will be better.
The ancients taught this method of treatment, Ataxmir.
However, there is concern over the patient, and it is from good practice, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a shape which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to this shape which follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this shape, with evenness of incision.
But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and gather the threads together between your fingers with evenness.
Then raise your hand with an even raising: and raise the skin over which the pattern has been marked, as we have narrated.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and take care of it until it is healed.
But if an abscess should occur at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with cerate, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that their hairs are turned.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
And it is, that you turn back the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have related.
Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a spathula: and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully apply each over that which superfluously protrudes from the eyelid, and bind the two reeds on both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. For the constricted skin will die, and blacken, and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then incise it with scissors.
Then treat it until it is healed.
When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two tubes, which you make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
Concerning the elevation of hairs pricking in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The operation in this is, that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread. Then you bring together its ends, and knot each with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place in Alinxotati another fine thread under it shortly, and knot its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient place his head in your bosom, and be near the sun so that the operation is illuminated: because it is a subtle, or minute, operation.
Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you pull it out from above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the Alinxotati: and insert that hair into the Alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the Alinxotati is pulled, and the hair does not come out with it: you will pull the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you placed in it, until the Alinxotati comes out from the upper hole, and you see it with the vision of the eye: then indeed you will pull the Alinxotati and the thread: and pull out both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and lift it with it: or leave it, until it lengthens after a space, and then lift it.
Concerning the care of the Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental, therefore, it is made from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is that you split that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and you place in what is between them a pledget of linen, and you bind it, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things which dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocate with water, in which has been boiled marsh-mallow, flaxseed: and diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil: and envelop with it a pledget, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all ingenuity that it not consolidate, according to the form which it had in the beginning.
And this indeed operation which we have spoken of, is not except a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return completely as it was. Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which happens in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which happens below, is that which is truly named Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And accidental happens from a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and those similar.
And the way of operation in it is, that you take a needle, in which is a double thread, and you dip it into the flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread arrives at the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh to the superior parts with a needle, and incise it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it ought, it is good.
And if not, take a ray, and place it in the fissure, and turn with it the eyelid: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is made from them: until when they are gathered together their figure is made this figure, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with a wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have spoken of, softening medicines, and linen cloths, until they are healed.
And if an abscess occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a linen cloth, according to what we said.
And the sum of the discourse on the treatment of an abscess, when it is above, or below, is, that the operation proceeds in it, according to what is prepared from the form of the abscess.
For it is of many diversities in form: and the skillful surgeon prepares a method with whatever way is possible for him, until he causes the figure to return to the natural form, or near it, and the patient himself, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and instruments in many situations.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many men, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid, and raise it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be with the sharpness of cutting spatulas, but rather somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and injures the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you are scraping away that adhesion easily, until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the whole adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with water: or instill into it something made from dissolved verdigris with water.
Then separate the eyelid and eye with a linen cloth: and place on the eye wool infused with egg white: and after the third day use verdigris, and with solidifying agents, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of flesh at the tear duct.
Chapter XVI.
Know that a nail is according to two methods. Or it is sinewy: and is similar to hard, thin sinew.
Or it is not sinewy, similar to congealed white moisture: which when iron touches it, or you try to seize it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not fix in it.
And both types do not begin except from the greater lacrimal duct, until it gradually goes, until it covers the vision, and prevents light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operating on its incision is: that the infirm person puts his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Then collect the nail with a hook of little doubling, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or an ox, or a cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were scraping it with the hair up to its end.
Then incise the remainder at the root of the lachrymal duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the lachrymal duct, so that a constant flow of tears does not occur from its incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone; or with thread, as we have said.
Then scrape with a gentle spatula, whose form is this.
And beware lest the spatula touch the corneal tunic, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Then after the incision, throw into the eye some crushed salt, or something made from ziniar, and leave it until another day.
Then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed. But if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is treated many times with medicines, and is healed as I have narrated in the division.
But if you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the patient, and take a thin, smooth spatula of weak sharpness, according to this form.
And shave the nail from above carefully with subtlety.
But if you see that it is rarefied and broken, and the shaving impresses upon it, then instill from your hour into the eye some sief made from ziniar, or from red sief, or crushed salt: and close the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation on it until all of it is removed.
Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye contrary to this: for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it heals. Then repeat the operation on it carefully until it heals.
However, if the prominence of the lachrymal flesh causes great harm to the eye, suspend it with a hook, and incise part of it: and do not extend the incision, lest the flow of tears be impeded.
Then instill into the lachrymal duct red copper sulfate, or something made from verdigris, until it heals. Concerning the incision of the Albucasis, and the flesh growing in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes a red, fleshy growth develops in the eyes of men, either superimposed upon or covering the pupil, or approaching or constricting the eyelids, and perhaps inverting the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a wild rose.
And the operation in this case is that the patient should place his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with hooks suitable for it; and hold it with one forceps, or a pair.
Then incise the flesh first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel.
And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation; and let your incision be made either with the knife we have described in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which the asebel is collected, according to what its form will be after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed, and all the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or instill into it red powder, and things similar to it from corrosive medicines; and place over the eye externally cotton with egg white: so that it may be protected from hot abscess.
But if some of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which soothes an abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh which happens in the eye from this kind.
However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of every weak eye, from natural or accidental cause, by operating with iron; and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations, until you see that that member is tolerating that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebel are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent the sight from its function; and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which is Sebel is strong, and there is no illness in it other than Sebel: then collect its Sebel.
And it is so that you should instruct the patient to put his head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks joined in one body, according to this form.
Then collect with fine scissors those veins with subtlety, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are resolved: and beware lest you injure the eye with the ends of the spatula.
And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red vitriol, so that by its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the sebum.
But if it is not possible for you to collect it all at that time, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until its pain is settled and it is secure from a hot abscess: then repeat on it in the same manner, until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of the Arisatus to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call Arisatus a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what its description precedes.
And if it is not healed, then there is no skill in it: except that you should incise above the abscess at its origin, and draw out all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is called the rough head.
Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like an awl, which is pointed with a file's point, or with a graver's point, a fine point: and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone. Then roll it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that that corruption is now scraped away: and do that several times.
Then roll it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that that corruption is now scraped away: and do that several times. Then restore the place with drying, styptic medicines.
If therefore the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not fester, and no accident happens in it: then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no remedy in it, except to return the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this method.
And it is, that you uncover from the second bone with an iron, or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone is uncovered, then take a trephine of this form, let its iron tip be triangular: and its wooden part be a pyramid tapering to the tip, as you see.
Then place it upon the bone itself: and let it be near the lachrymal duct; and move your hand a little away from the eye.
Then turn your hand with the trephine, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: through this, that he finds wind exiting from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with drying styptic medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens: then the matter which was poured out externally, returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter for the patient.
Concerning the reduction of a protrusion of the eye. Chapter 20.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision: then it is necessary that you loosen the patient; then you should bleed him; afterwards you should apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocol.
Then bind the eye above with a plaster with many powders.
And the method of the powders is: that you take many soft cloths, and each cloth of them is doubled fourfold: make many of them; then place them one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye needs; then bind over them with a hard cloth with a strong binding.
And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound night and day.
But if the bandage again softens, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has returned to the state of the tunic, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the powders, and the binding, and the cupping glasses, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the uvea.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the uvea, then it protrudes and comes forth outside the eyelids like a grape, and the man's appearance is marred because of it, and you wish to incise it: then the operation in it is as I relate: and it is that you insert a needle into the root of the grape from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle in which is a double thread from the lachrymal side, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the needle; and tighten it much.
Then remove the needle, and place over the eye wool infused in egg white; and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the uvea is constricted from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds a large prominence.
Then it is perforated with a thin spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and the white humor flows out, and the eye descends, and enters immediately; then tighten it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of alcomnati.
Chapter XXII.
This ailment which is called alcomnati is nothing but pus which gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not itself water.
And the method of operating on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Then take his head with your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts in your eyes.
Then it is fixed, and does not descend, and the light is resolved: and the patient sees things as he saw: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands. Then take a thin spatula, and incise with it above the corneal layer a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in a circle, until the pus comes out.
When therefore it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then let it be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already spoken of the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for perforation in the statement explaining and expounding it, then take the same according to the health.
Then therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands squarely, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and bind it tightly: then the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which is the water is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take with your right hand an almond, if the eye is the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the end of the almond near the cornea by the thickness of a ray in the very apparent whiteness of the smaller lachrymal eye: then push the almond with force: and you roll your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the almond has now arrived at the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almond to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and that is the cornea of the eye.
For you will see them in the pupil itself by the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Then place the almond up to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almond comes out.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then draw out the almond with ease: and you roll your hand gradually. Then dissolve something of clear gem salt in water: and wash the eye inside with it.
Then place outside the eye all the lint, or wool infused with rose oil, and egg white: and bind with it the healthy eye.
But we, and those who are of our time, put on it crushed cumin with egg white.
But if the almond does not obey you at entry into the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose form is this.
Therefore pierce with it only the conjunctiva, and do not put your hand in the hole: and it is only to make a subtle way to the place of the almond.
Then introduce the almond, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, let a properly made sleeping place be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and let him be forbidden all movements, and coughing: and put his food to that which soothes his nature: and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage remain in its place until the third day. Then unbind it in that dark room, and test his sight: and make him see things.
Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that he do that at the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision: nay, it is necessary that he avoid it: because water rises quickly through vehement looking.
But if a warm abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you unbind the eye before the seventh [day]: and rectify it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed: then clear its vision, and place on his face an oral [medicine] by which his sight is governed under it for a few days, he himself being in that dark room.
Then let him go out from the house gradually, and converse in his houses.
And know that in the cautery the pupil is not excused from vision sometimes: then indeed let him dare the operation.
And now indeed there has come to us a certain one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that there was made in Alayrach a perforated magdan, by which water is sucked.
Truly therefore I did not see anyone in your land who made it: nor did I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the species from magda, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon them.
Let them be made of bronze properly: and let their extremities be triangulated with this same thinness, and a sharp extremity.
Forms of magda.
Concerning the care of flesh born in the nose.
Chapter 24.
Sometimes diverse fleshy growths are born in the nose, of which something is similar to a scorpion with many feet; and of it is cancerous flesh, stony, of a dark color; and of it is that which is soft flesh, not of a dark color.
Therefore, in that which of these fleshes is soft, not malignant, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the infirm one sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and throw a hook into those fleshes; then pull them outwards, and incise what you have grasped of them with a thin, sharp spatula from one side, until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
But if something remains of it whose excision is not possible, then shave it with one of the thin instruments easily, until nothing of it remains.
But if the blood dominates you, or a hot abscess happens, then oppose it by what is necessary: or it is of malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the blood is cut off and all the flesh is removed.
Then vinegar and water, or wine, shall be thrown into the nose after the incision.
But if the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is now healthy.
If however the moisture does not penetrate as it ought, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then therefore it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and put between each knot the quantity of a finger, or less; and let the infirm person cause one end of the thread to be put into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it like azer; and let him draw his breath until it reaches to the cavity and comes out over his throat.
And indeed boys often do something like this in schools; and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Then take and minister the scraping of the flesh with the knots which are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread: and put into the nose after wiping away the blood a pledget which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then finally put a lead tube in the nose for a few days, until it heals.
If however it needs a drying treatment, use that.
To make a head-purge, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: let it be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its channel similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for making a head-purge, should be full, open; to which there should be a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish of juices and flowing things.
And this is the form of the instrument. Concerning the care of nasal polyps.
Chapter 25.
Often a polyp is born in the extremity of the nose, and it is magnified and increased with the days, until its appearance becomes foul.
And because of that it is necessary that you cut it in the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it.
Then place on the location either a cautery or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is stony, hard, of a dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, because it is a cancerous abscess.
For many times I have seen someone who incised such an abscess, and great harm resulted from it to the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that its incision is possible in its entirety, then empty the diseased area, and incise it without fear, without dread: and treat the place with that which dries and constricts, until it is healed.
Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when a discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, the operation contributes little in them, except in certain men.
Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you ought to consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood; and then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture; then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the discontinuity are already separated, and each part has become healthy: then it is necessary that you scrape away all the part from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Then bring together the two lips with a suture, and bind them, and powder over it dragon's blood and ground olibanum: and put over the powders a piece of diachylon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then unbind it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is to bring together the solution of continuity, either with needles, as we have narrated in the suturing of the belly: or bring together the solution with thread, as I have made you know.
Concerning the extraction of knots from the lips.
Chapter XXVII. Indeed, many people frequently have hard abscesses similar to barley grains in their inner lips; and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the lip, and incise over each knot, and suspend it with a hook, and incise it on all sides.
Then fill the place after the incision with crushed alum, until the bleeding stops.
Then let it be washed with vinegar, and the place be treated with it, in which there is astringency, until the wounds heal.
Concerning the incision of flesh grown over the gum.
Chapter XXVIII. Often flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Therefore it is necessary to suspend it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and incise it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Then place crushed zegi on the place, or other styptic, drying powders.
But if that flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
Concerning the treatment of teeth with iron.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, foul crusts gather on the surfaces of the teeth, on the inner and outer sides, and between the gums, and sometimes they blacken, and become yellow, and green, until corruption from it reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul because of it.
Therefore it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth on which you see crusts and things like sand, until nothing of them remains; and similarly do with the blackness, and greenness, and yellowness, and others until they are cleaned.
If therefore that which is in them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second, and a third, until at last your intention is achieved in what you wish.
And know that a tooth needs scrapers of diverse forms, of many shapes, according to what is prepared for your operation; therefore, the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
And these forms of scrapers should be prepared and ready for you, which you see.
Concerning the extraction of aching teeth.
Chapter 30.
You ought to treat a tooth for its pain with all your skill, and delay in its extraction.
For there is nothing to replace it when it is extracted, since it is a noble substance: until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary, when the patient is compelled to extract it, that the aching tooth be firmly and securely grasped by you.
For often pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a sound tooth and extracts it; then the pain does not depart until the diseased tooth is extracted.
For we have already seen this from the practice of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is ascertained by you, then you ought to scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some efficacy, until the gum is loosened on all sides; then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Then place large forceps on it with a good grip, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have now held well, so that it does not move; then draw the tooth straight out, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it on all sides easily, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
But if the tooth is perforated or corroded: then you ought to fill that hole with a cloth; and bind it with the end of a fine rod, so that it is not broken at the time of your pulling on it with forceps.
And it is necessary to act carefully with the scarification around the gum on all sides very much.
And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the patient from it a harm which is greater than his first pain.
And beware lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness concerning its eradication, beyond what we have recounted.
For very often they cause to happen to men great sicknesses, which are more difficult to be broken, and its roots all remain, or some of them; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have often testified to that. Then let it be washed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt. But if a flow of blood happens from the place (for it often happens), then grind something of alum, and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the alum does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved, should have long ends, a short, thick handle, so that they do not bend when pressure is applied with them to the tooth: let them be like you see thick handles, until when you press with them, they do not bite themselves, nor bend: short ends, and let them be made of good iron, or of steel properly made, with straight ends: and at their ends let there be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with a decent, strong constriction.
And sometimes the ends are made like the shape of the beak of a bird which is called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Chapter XXXI.
When, in the eradication of a tooth, something of it remains, then it is necessary that you place a poultice with butter on the place for one or two days, until the place is softened: then insert into it a probe, or forceps; the ends of which resemble the beak of a bird which is called a stork.
This, however, is the shape of the forceps.
Let their ends be made like a file within: or like aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to you to exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you search for the root, and uncover all the flesh, and insert an instrument which is called a small lever, of which this is the form.
Let it be short in its extremity, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, lest it break.
If therefore the root exits through it, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments, of which these are the forms.
The form of the first is triangular at the extremity, in which there is a certain thickness.
The form of a triangular extremity, slender.
It is also aided with this instrument having two branches, of which this is the form. And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the matter of teeth.
Also let there be aid with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this form, of twisted triangular extremity, in which there is some thickness, so that it is not broken: and let it not be soaked.
And know that the instruments for teeth are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the skillful artisan, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument, according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, because of the diversity of their kinds.
But if a bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then investigate it in its place with that which is suitable to it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a probe, whose form is this.
Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone may be constricted, or held with it, and not escape and move, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the sawing of teeth projecting above others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth project not according to their natural course, the form is made foul by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those who are for sale.
For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not located, or its sawing or filing is possible, then eradicate it; and if it is joined with another tooth, then incise it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, very sharp at the end.
And let your incision, by which you incise it, be over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
But if it is prominent and exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of tempered iron, of which this is the form.
Let it be wholly of tempered iron, and its handle of very small points, like a file with which needles are made; with which the tooth may be filed gradually over many days easily, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, finally shave it with certain scrapers.
But if it is a tooth, from which a part is broken, and injures the tongue: then it is necessary that you file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made level: and smoothed, and does not injure the tongue, nor impair speech.
Concerning the retention of teeth with gold threads.
Chapter 33.
When a shaking and displacement of the front teeth occurs from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines and the treatment has not worked, then the method is to bind them with gold thread; because silver turns green and rots after a time, but gold never changes.
And let the thread be moderate in thinness and thickness according to the amount that fits between the teeth.
And the method of binding is as follows: you take the thread, and insert a double portion of it between two healthy teeth; then you weave the two ends of the thread between the moved teeth, whether it be one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving to the point where you began; and tighten your hand with skill and wisdom, until it is not at all loosened; and let your binding, with which you tighten the thread, be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors; and join both, and twist them together; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue; then let it remain so bound.
But if it loosens or is cut, bind them with another thread, and it will remain thus for the whole time.
And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the binding of two healthy teeth and two moved teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after the fall of both, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and this is only done by a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman.
And sometimes something from the bones of animals is fitted; and it is made like the shape of a tooth, and is placed in the place from which the tooth is supported and bound, as we have said; and it remains, and serves for a long time.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
Chapter 34.
But if in it there is something of hardness and knotting, and it is from the healing of a wound: then throw a hook into it, and split it across, until you incise the ligament, and the knotting is released.
But if a flow of blood occurs, then put pounded alum on the place. But if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a slow cautery, which is suitable for it; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed. Concerning the extraction of a ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Chapter 35.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it is magnified so much that it fills the mouth.
If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, to which the patient finds no sensation: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
And if it inclines towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw into it a hook, and incise it with a thin spatula, and free it from every part.
But if blood overcomes you in the hour of your operation, then put on it crushed alum until the bleeding stops; then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt: and treat it with the remaining treatment suitable for it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will perforate it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin, then it must be incised.
And the procedure in this is that you should consider before its operation whether the heat of its abscess has quieted completely, or is lessened by some diminution; then therefore make the patient sit before the sun, and let his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let a servant hold his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, of which this is the form. Let it be made of silver or bronze, which is thin like a knife.
Therefore, when you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you pull something of the tunics with it.
Then incise it with an instrument, of which this is the form which follows.
It is similar to scissors; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other sharply; therefore take care that it is made of strong iron, or tempered steel.
But if this instrument is not present, then incise it with a spatula, of which this is the form.
Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you incise one tonsil, incise the other according to this same manner of incision.
Then after the incision let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
But if a flow of blood should happen to him, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and things similar to them from among the styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses are produced in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore incise them according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I indeed already treated a woman from an abscess which had arisen between her throat, which was pulling towards blackness, little sensation, which already almost closed the throat: and the woman was breathing from a narrow passage, and it already prevented her eating, and drinking water: and she had already come to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
And the abscess had ascended so much that it had sent out two branches until they came out above the two openings of the nose.
Therefore I hastened and fixed a hook in one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the opening of the nose.
Then I did the same to that which protruded from the other opening of the nose.
Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and nothing but a little blood flowed from it: therefore the woman's throat was cured, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Therefore I did not cease to incise that abscess many times for a long time: and the abscess succeeded in the place of what I incised, until it became very long and with it that.
Therefore I devised a plan, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore it stopped from increasing; then I went away, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
Concerning the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When catarrh descends to the uvula and forms an abscess, and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot abscess has subsided from it, and it is thin, then it is necessary to incise it.
And that which is gathered from it, round, and does not have length, and is bloody, or brown in color, or black, and has no feeling: then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
For in it there is fear for the patient.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I have described, from its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit before the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, whose description has preceded; then fix a hook in the uvula, and draw it downwards; and incise it with one of the two instruments which I have described in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary not to incise from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise more of it, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision use what we have described in the incision of the two tonsils; and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision: then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and terror.
And the method of cauterization in it is not, except with a sharp instrument; and it is that you place the patient's head in your bosom.
Then press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned.
Then take of the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterizing, and mix with it some unquenched lime, and put it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the form.
Let the extremity of it in which the medicine is placed have a concavity, like the concavity of a spoon's bowl.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself: and let the patient lie on his side, so that the saliva may run from his mouth from the inside of the medicine, so that nothing from it may descend to his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you shall hold it over the uvula for the space of half an hour, until you see it already blackened, and the biting of the medicine subdued.
And if you wish to take a pledget, and wrap it around the end of the instrument, and soak the pledget with medicine, and insert the instrument with the pledget into the cannula from above, until the pledget adheres to the uvula. Do this many times, until you obtain what you wish of the cauterization of the uvula.
Then leave it: for it itself dries and falls after three or four days.
But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the uvula with a pledget soaked in butter, and cleanse it from what remains around it of the medicine: and wash with cold water.
And let it be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Therefore this method of treatment is healthier than incision and further from fear.
And sometimes the uvula is also cured with something finer than cautery and incision: for it is cured with fumigation, in this manner.
Take calamint, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and seah, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and mix all of them, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be luted with clay properly: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this manner.
Let it be made of silver or bronze: and let the end, in which the pomegranate is, be inserted into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor ascends to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is much darkened.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you do this cure at the beginning of the arrival of the abscess.
For often it adds to the abscess: and it is not fitting that you do it except at the decline of its warm abscess.
But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and place on its end eggshell: so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned: because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is of good cure with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often a bone, or fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore it is necessary that you extract what of them is apparent upon which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument toward the sun, and it is shown to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the infirm person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the infirm person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a morsel of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge; and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it.
When therefore it arrives at the place where the splinters or bone are, and is pulled out, then it comes out. If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be somewhat thicker than a radius, and at its end let there be a curve, which he may easily insert into his throat; and let him have his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest a cough should come upon him, and push the bone or splinter with it, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
But that the patient himself insert it is better, because of his knowledge of the place where the thing is attached; and let him push downwards, or draw his hand upwards with the instrument, all of it according to the quantity prepared for him, until it comes out.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter 39.
When the leech is treated with what I mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then observe in the patient's throat before the sun, or by the sun, after you have pressed down his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine tweezers delicately.
But if it is not possible with these: then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the patient's throat as far as the throat; then insert into the concavity of the cannula a piece of iron heated with fire.
Do this many times; and let the patient abstain from water the whole day.
Then let him take a glass full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water.
But if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs, or with asafoetida with the instrument which I described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this many times, because it itself will fall.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals with fire: and let the pot be covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and let the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Then throw in the fumigation, and let the patient put his mouth to the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall.
But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salt and garlic, and not drink water. Therefore it is necessary that it comes out with this treatment.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is removed from the throat, when it falls upon the sight itself.
It is similar to forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
And its end is similar to the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is a roughness like a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to the recollection of them, namely, one, and one in this book: and they differ in their perforation, and incision of them in two ways.
One of which is from the species of abscess in itself, and that which it contains of humors.
And the second way is because of the places in which it happens in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And of abscesses there are some which it is not necessary to perforate, except after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion: and of them there are some which it is necessary to perforate while they are raw, and are not matured according to completion.
Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration is prolonged, until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: wherefore it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that limb.
Or there is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that, or through that, the principal member.
Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it immature: and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its end that which is not healed. It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of an abscess which has matured according to its completeness: and this is at the cessation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuteness of the head of the abscess: and the other signs. And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of more vehement eminence: and let the perforation go in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and lastly in all equal places, in which there is no reflection.
But in those which are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
When however the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you delay its perforation, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to its completeness.
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and foulness, and perhaps its lips and its depth become hardened.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body by necessity: or according to that which the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a large perforation: or many incisions similar to the size of the abscess.
And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be hollowed out: and incised when it has become like a cloth, and has reached the point that it is now dead: as that which happens in many, such as boils and buboes.
And some of them are cut with a three-angled incision.
And some of them are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an inguinal abscess.
And some of them are treated with a round incision, and a lunate incision, and similar incisions.
However, that which has no head, such as are soft superficial abscesses, it is necessary to perforate it with a superficial or only a flat perforation.
And it is necessary, when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, that you do not hurry and extract all the pus at that time: rather, extract a part of it from it.
Then stop up the abscess until another day.
Then extract something of the pus again.
Do this many times gradually, until it comes out: especially if the patient is a weak person, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person: for the animal spirit is often dissolved from the body with the exit of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Beware therefore of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound: and consider.
Therefore if the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is flat, then apply a linen cloth, or old cloth.
And if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then it is necessary that you insert into every fissure a linen cloth, until they meet each other.
And if in the abscess you have cut away a part of the skin, or have hollowed it out around the edges: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when cloth is woven, or is shaved with linen lint without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them: and place it on the place of bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this our book, and from the division.
But if it is in the time of winter, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse little bags with warm wine and oil: and place them on the places.
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place little bags soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of it cold.
Until, when it is the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
This therefore is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the way of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, in what way is the way to its treatment chapter by chapter individually.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the scalp.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur in the scalp, and they are of the species of Nodes, which contain tunics, which are sacs for them: as if they themselves were the wattles of a hen.
And their types are many.
Some of them are fatty; and some of them contain a moisture similar to mud; and some of them contain a moisture similar to cooked vegetables and porridge; and similar things; and some of them are hard and stony.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, provided that an artery is not injured during their incision.
And the operation in their incision is that you should explore them with an instrument, whose shape comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if it is that which contains moisture, then incise it lengthwise with a superficial incision: according to this shape.
And begin the incision from line b. to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it at all.
For very often it returns, if anything of it remains. Then submerge a pledget in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remains of the cyst. Then repeat on it with the pledget with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess contains a fatty lump, then cut it according to this method, the incision having the form of a cross: and throw hooks between the lips of the incision, and scrape it from every side: and exert your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
But if an artery opposes you, then do what I shall tell you afterwards.
And similarly act in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said. And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in certain men, with which there is altogether no moisture.
Or place their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus may be relieved downwards.
Then treat them with what is suitable for them from treatment.
Concerning the incision of strumae in the neck.
Chapter XLII.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those which of them occur in the neck, there are one, and many: and they are generated from each other: and every struma of them is within its own tunic, just as it is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the species of these strumae are many.
And of them indeed there are stony ones: and of them there are those which contain humours: and of them there are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore in that one of them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose manifest colour is close to that of the skin, and moves in every direction, and is not connected with the nerves of the neck, nor with the jugular vein, nor with an artery, nor is deep: it is necessary that you should excise it with a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b. to line, g. and flay it from every part: and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is concerning caution, that a vein, or nerve, should not be cut.
And let the spatula not be very sharp: lest it should injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
But if you cut a vein, or artery, or it prevents you from operating, then place on the wound crushed alum, or some powders which staunch blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wishes to suppurate.
For the blood is stanched. Therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Then take care of it.
If the whole pustule is incised, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and dress it immediately, after you see that completely no excess remains.
But if you see that excess remains because of the size of the pustule, then it is necessary that you strive to incise its root, and extract it: and administer the suture which we have described.
And which of the pustules contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial perforation: so that the place of its maturity appears to you: and place the perforation from that which follows lower in the body, as we have said.
Then after the perforation administer a pledget with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound to be already cleansed: then take care of it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients said this incision in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their words.
However, in those having synanche, the incision of the epiglottis ought to be avoided: since no help is done by it; because all the veins and the lung are weak.
In those, however, who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in the two tonsils, when there is no illness in the windpipe, it is necessary to use incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the loss which happens from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should incise the epiglottis between three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across, in that which is between two circles, to the extent that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage: and indeed this place is suitable for incision, since it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
But if the physician is timid, then it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then let him incise the skin, until when he arrives at the windpipe: let him avoid a blood vessel, if he sees any of them.
Then let him cut the membrane which we have described: and the incision of the windpipe is indicated by the phlegm which comes out of it, with that which is broken, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis.
The sum of this discourse which we have related is this: only when they see that one of these abscesses has already blocked the throat of the patient, and the patient is close to death, and his breathing is to be cut off, do they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient breathes through the wound, and is saved from death; and for this reason they ordered the wound to be left open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed, and its malignancy is for three days, or so; then they order the wound to be sewn, and to be treated until it heals.
And that which I saw with my own eyes is that a maidservant took a knife and put it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the windpipe.
And I was called to her cure, and I found her roaring, like the roar of the dying.
I uncovered the wound therefore, and found the blood which had flowed from the wound was small.
Therefore I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor the gullet; and wind was coming forth from the wound.
I therefore cleaned and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better state.
Hence therefore I say: that in the incision of the epiglottis there is no fear.
Concerning the incision of a throat hernia.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is found much in women.
And it is according to two methods: for it is either natural or accidental. In the natural one certainly there is no pus.
The accidental one however is according to two methods: of which one is similar to fatty lumps.
And the other method is similar to an abscess which occurs from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and it is not fitting that a presumption be made to it with iron, except in that which is small: and you should probe it, and investigate it with a probe.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty lump, and it is not connected with any veins: then cut it, just as lumps are cut: and extract it with what contains it from a cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then explore the whole of it.
Then treat the place with what is necessary from treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision upon the types of Nodes.
Chapter XLV. There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their types in the division: and it is necessary that I relate here the difference between a Node and an Excrecence, since it is doubt-making. I say therefore, that when an Excrecence is heat, and fever, and vehement pains, until the boiling over of superfluity is settled, and putrefaction is completed: then indeed fever and heat are quiet.
With a Node however there is not heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them in a sifachin cyst, which is its own sac, and is according to the colour of the body: and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a date, and larger and smaller.
And they are according to two types: either fat: or they contain humidity.
And the colours of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division. It is necessary therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a Node, that you examine it, and investigate it firstly with an instrument which is called an Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter which is after this.
And the method of investigating abscesses, and all Nodes is, that you take this instrument, and insert it into the moistest place which you find in the abscess: and you revolve your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Then move your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider that which comes forth in its track.
If therefore a running moisture comes forth, whatever colour it may be: then cut it with a superficial incision, according to what I said in the other abscesses.
And if no moisture comes forth in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty: therefore cut upon it with an incision having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from every part with ease: and preserve the cyst if you can over it, so that you may extract it whole with the Node.
But if the cyst bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piecemeal, until nothing of it remains.
For if a little or much of it remains, the Node returns for the most part.
But if it overcomes you, and a little remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place upon it what sits upon a warm abscess, and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
If therefore the Node is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with that which incarnates. But if you have a contrary vein, pulsating or not pulsating: then hasten, and fill the place with pounded zegi, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of the blood ceases: then return to incising what remains of the Node.
Concerning the instruments for cutting and perforation.
Chapter XLVI.
Of these are the shapes of the introducers, and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and of them there is a medium one, and of them there is a small one.
Let them be made of well-tempered iron, square-ended, so that they may readily enter the abscess.
And these are the shapes of the perforating instruments, and one of them is called a beris, that is, a perforator; and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating by means of them abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes from what is between them of bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of bronze, or of brass, or iron, or silver. And better are those which are made of bronze.
And probes are also made of black lead, which are suitable for investigating by means of them fistulas, whose cavities have reflections, so that they may be gently reflected with those reflections.
And again they are of three kinds. Because some of them are long, some medium, and some short, according to the amount of the size of the fistula and its stricture. The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds. Because some of them are simple, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
And some of them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And some of them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and some of them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and skinned: and they are of three kinds: for there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Their ends which make the cutting are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except that with them help is given in the skinning of nodes, for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick man may be healed by them, and may find some relief from the burning which he finds in the skinning of an abscess.
These are probes, and they are of three kinds.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to a probe, with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end is a hidden spatula-point: and in it it runs to the inside and to the outside when you wish, as you see.
The shape of spatulas which are hidden between the fingers in the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Shapes of cupping-glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat long, as you see: and let them be of a thinness.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping-glasses be with you, large and small: that you may cut off blood by them quickly in necessity, and then when medicine is not present to you.
However, do not use them in cutting off blood in every place of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the thighs of the leg, and the hip, and the thighs of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar to them, of fleshy, moist thighs.
And sometimes small instruments are made from them similar to the husks of pistachios, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.
Concerning the care of the nipples of men which are similar to the nipples of women.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the nipples of some men are swollen at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they are similar to the nipples of women: and they remain badly ulcerated.
Therefore, he who detests that, ought to cut above the nipples with a lunate incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then flay all the fat.
Afterwards fill the wound with incarnative medicine.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it heals.
But if the nipple declines downwards, and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that it be incised on its two upper sides with two incisions similar to the lunar figure, each of which is joined with the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards flay the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said of the suture and powders, which is necessary for the treatment, until it heals.
But if you do not complete the incision of what you ought to incise, because of the patient's restlessness, or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a pledget soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess which occurs under the prepuce.
Chapter XLVIII. Those abscesses which occur under the prepuce are of the hard kinds of strumae, which contain cysts, and of those which contain humors.
Therefore those which contain humors ought to be incised with a lunate incision, according to this form, from line b. to line g.  When therefore all that is in the abscess of pus is evacuated, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until another day.
Then let the lint be removed, and let it be treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
But if the abscess is of the kind of nodes of strumae, then incise upon it, as we said in the section on strumae equally.
But if the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said in what precedes.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which happens because of an artery and a vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When an artery is broken, and the skin which is above it is consolidated, then many times an abscess happens from this; and similarly it happens to a vein also, so that an abscess and swelling happen in it.
And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are because of an artery and a vein are: because, when the abscess is because of an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a grating in it.
And that which is because of a vein is round in the evident part of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is a mistake, and especially that which is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Therefore it is necessary that its treatment with iron be avoided, and that which of them also is in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary that it be avoided.
Therefore, upon that which of them is from the swelling of the opening of an artery, make in the skin an incision lengthwise.
Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is uncovered.
Then insert under it a needle, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer treatment which produces pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterwards treat it with ointments suitable for it, until it is healed.
But if there is an abscess because of a cut vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much as you can of the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Then tie the abscess with a good ligature: according to what I told you in the ligature of a grape, from two parts with two ends of thread. But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the needle: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until when that which is in it comes out: then incise the superfluity of the skin, and leave that which is tied from it.
Then place on it a small cushion which you have submerged in wine and oil.
Then administer the treatment, which is done with linen cloths and ointments, until it is healed.
Concerning an abscess which happens from the twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess happens in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess happens in nerves: which happens in them through percussion, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things: and it happens most in the places of the joints, or heel, and in every place in which the joints are moved: and it is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many instances without pain: and when it is squeezed forcefully, the sick person feels in it something like numbness.
And it is not an abscess gathered deep in the body, rather it is under the skin, and it itself is moved to every part, and does not go forward, or before, nor backward to the rear.
Therefore, that which is among them in the joints, ought not to be invaded with iron.
Perhaps a contraction will happen.
But in that which of them is in the head, or in the forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it: then remove it, and close the wound with suture: and treat it, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which happens in the belly.
Chapter 51. It happens to some men many times in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies,  thelil, which are called Fungals, because of their similarity to fungi.
Whose root is thin, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted.
And some of them are small; and some of them become very large.
And indeed I myself saw a man, and in his belly were two thelil, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, with small roots, and their lips were inverted, and they were split, and moisture always flowed from them.
Therefore I cut them out, and I found one weighed about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces. And the procedure in cutting them out is that you should consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the thelil is white, moist, with a thin root: then cut it out with a broad spatula, and have cauteries in the fire ready at hand.
For very often much blood is expelled during its excision; therefore if the bleeding overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
But if you see the patient is fearful and timid of incision with iron, then take a neatly made lead thread, and tie the thelil with it: the method of which is as we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the tightness of the lead.
Therefore do not cease tightening the lead, as often as it presses on the thelil, until it is cut off and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the thelil has a thick root, then there is something of fear and dread in its excision: especially that which is in the abdomen.
Nevertheless, it is possible to incise half of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you presume to incise a thelil which is brown in color, of little feeling, and foul appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess; and I shall come to the remembrance of Cancer after this.
Concerning the treatment of the protrusion of the navel.
Chapter 52.
A protrusion of the navel occurs from many causes.
Or from fissures of the sifac, which is upon the belly: and from it there exits althub, or intestine, according as it happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood which flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been premised.
Or from wind constricted there.
But if it is because of a fissure of the sifac, and the exit of the thirbi: then it is similar in color to the color of an abscess: and it is soft, without pain: and appears of diverse location.
And if it is because of the egress of the intestine, then its location is, with that which we have related, of more vehement diversity.
Therefore when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bath, and vehement labor.
If however it is because of humidity, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor constricted, nor is anything added.
But if it is because of blood, then with these signs an abscess appears tending toward blackness.
But if it is because of  newly formed flesh: then it is a serious abscess, large, hard, and fixed according to a single quantity.
But if it is because of flatulence, then its touch is soft. And the operation in that is, that you consider then, if the prominence of the umbilicus is because of the blood of an artery, or vein, or flatulence: then you must be forbidden from its treatment.
For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of abscesses because of an artery and a vein.
But if the prominence of the umbilicus is because of the intestine, or a hernia: then you must instruct the patient, so that he holds his breath, and stands upright and extended.
Then mark with a cautery around the whole umbilicus.
Afterwards instruct him to lie on his back between your hands.
Then surround with a broad spatula around the umbilicus above the place which you marked with the cautery.
Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards, with a large hook.
Then tie it around firmly with thread, or with a silk cord with a strong ligature: and let the knot of the ligature be secure.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligature.
If therefore you find it already caught by the ligature: then pull out the ligature, and insert into it the index finger, and push the intestine into the interior of the belly: and if you find a zirbus, then take it with a hook, and incise its superfluity.
But if an artery or vein is opposite to you, then surround it much.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles into the circumference which you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then bind the abscess in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls by itself: or incise it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments, until it is healed.
But if the prominence of the navel is of raw flesh in it, or of moisture: then it is necessary that you hollow out the abscess, as we said.
And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Then treat it with what solidifies the place.
Concerning the care of cancer. Chapter 53.
For I have not been able to cure anyone from it: nor have I seen another before me who has succeeded in it.
And the operation in it, when it is located as we have said, is that you precede, and relieve the patient from black bile sometimes.
Then phlebotomize him if you find him with manifest repletion.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation, in which he is situated with the operation.
Then throw hooks into the Cancer which are suitable for it.
Afterwards, hollow it out from every part with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, but rather express the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever is possible there of instruments.
But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter 54.
We have already narrated in the division the types of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only a type of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympanites: nor in the case of hyposarca completely: for that is deadly.
When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not helped: then consider.
For if weakness has already overtaken the patient, or there is another illness with him besides dropsy: such as if he has a cough, or looseness of the bowels, and similar things: then beware lest you treat him with iron: because there is danger in that.
But if you see a patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you raise the standing patient between your hands, and a helper behind him presses his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a spiny trocar, according to this form.
Let it be of two sharp parts, long, the sharp end like a trocar.
However, let there be some shortness in it gradually, so that you do not pass through with it in the operation as far as the intestine, and injure it.
Then consider.
For if the generation of dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen with the incision from the navel the quantity of three fingers, downwards directly above the pubis.
If, however, the generation of dropsy is because of illness of the liver: then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Then pierce the whole skin with an instrument.
Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with a spatula between the skin and the fat, as if you are flaying it: and let the quantity which is flayed be the quantity of a fingernail, or about that.
Then pierce the fat, until the spatula reaches the empty place: and it is the place of the water.
Then extract it, and insert into the hole an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: which in its lower part has a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and its end is incised, according to the manner of the incision of a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore empty out from the water in an hour a moderate quantity.
Because if you empty out from it more than is necessary, perhaps in an hour the sick man dies through the dissolution of his animal spirit: or a syncope happens to him which approaches death.
But empty out from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what the conditions of the sick man signify to you by the strength of his pulse, and by the goodness of it.
Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Which is, because it is immediately retained because of the skin which retains the hole which is over the siphon: about which I have narrated, that you may pierce it according to that method.
Then repeat the instrument on the following day, if you see the sick man tolerate it: and also remove from the water a small quantity. Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains of the water only a little.
But if you fear for the patient, and you leave a large amount of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water: according to what I have narrated in what preceded.
Concerning the care of infants who are born with their urinary places not perforated.
Chapter 55. When an infant exits from the womb of its mother, and the opening of its penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is not in its proper place.
Therefore it is necessary to help with its perforation immediately upon birth with a very fine spatula, according to this method.
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening and bind it: and keep it there for three or four days.
When therefore he wants to urinate, it should be removed, and he will urinate.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
But he whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are injured.
That is because in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: therefore he cannot urinate forwards, until he raises his penis with his hand upwards. Nor is there generation for him, because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul disease.
And the method of operation in that case is that the patient is laid on his back.
Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and incise the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp point, or a sharp scalpel: like the incision of a reed, or like you shave something, so that its middle becomes similar to the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as it ought.
And beware in your operation of a flow of blood.
For that often happens.
Therefore apply to it that which stops blood, and take care of the wound until it heals.
Concerning what happens to the foreskin and the head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These things often happen in the penis, and it is a protrusion of foul flesh.
And of this, some is malignant, and some is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook, and you should cut it away until you cleanse it entirely.
Then place over it lint soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterwards with diafinicon ointment until it heals.
But if the Albucasis is malignant, of foul colour, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and shaving.
But if the Albucasis is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the Albucasis is between the foreskin, and part of it outside: then it is necessary to remove the Albucasis which is inside first, until when it consolidates, then treat the outside: because when you treat it simultaneously, the foreskin is not secured from being perforated.
And now blackness and corruption also happen in the testicles and foreskin.
Therefore it is necessary that you hollow out everything that is already blackened, and that wants to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Then smear over it afterwards with honey which is already pounded with the flour of pomegranate rinds and sifted crushed herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
But if a flow of blood happens, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for a flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted.
But if the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole thing is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary that you insert into the meatus of the penis a small tube of lead, so that the sick man may urinate over it.
However, in the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not happen except in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required for it: and sometimes adhesion happens because of a wound, or an abscess: therefore it is necessary that you scrape it with a blunt spatula, until the ligament is dissolved, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
But if it is difficult to distinguish them exquisitely, then it is necessary that you scrape something from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
That is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it is perforated because of its thinness quickly.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine until it is consolidated. Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the cure of an accident happening to them.
Chapter 57.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; nevertheless, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation, and a more gentle way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
That is, because I have found the majority of practitioners and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and they use cautery, and binding with thread, and incision with a nail.
And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and I have found none better than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Because the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is incised, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is forced to a further incision to incise the other, and future pain.
And with cleansing which is done by cautery, that is, a cauterizing iron, which tailors use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not secured: because perhaps it enters its hole.
But in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron escapes, and corrupts your operation: and indeed a child's skin is short by nature, and very often they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen that.
However, cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread has revealed a good experiment to me: because scissors are proportional in incision: therefore, because the sharpness which is above, is like the sharpness which is below.
Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they incise according to one operation in one time: and a compression of similar figure is made, containing the skin of the penis from every side, with which no error falls at all.
And the proper method of operation is that you cause to be expected, a boy especially, if he is from among those who understand a little, that you do not do, except that you tie a thread only on his penis: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that is possible for you, from that which his understanding receives.
Then insert your hand to his penis, and inflate the skin, and draw it upwards, until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it from the filth that is gathered in it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Afterwards tie a second ligature a little lower down. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature securely, and incise between the two ligatures.
Then raise the skin upwards quickly, and draw out the head of the rod.
Then let the blood flow gradually (for this is better) and put powder on top: and over the powder a cloth in which has been spread the yolk of an egg boiled in rosewater, beaten with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on it until the next day: and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Now the shape of the forceps for cleansing is this.
Let the two ends be blunt, and let them meet: lest a point of the nail project from them: and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles equally.
The error however that occurs in cleansing is: because perhaps the whole inner skin, or a part of it near the incision, escapes. Therefore it is necessary that you stretch it out at your leisure with your fingernail before suppuration of the place: and incise it evenly.
But if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then draw it out with a hook, and incise it.
But if three days pass, and what is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated: then leave it until the hot abscess settles, and flay it easily, and incise it as it is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod.
For that will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders which we have recounted in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised through the skin beyond measure, and extends to the upper parts, that also will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Chapter 58.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and similar things from those which we have mentioned among the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that the patient be bent over on his knees.
Then his feet should be placed upon his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as possible.
The stone is thus forced from the neck of the bladder towards the posterior, wherefore the urine is released.
But if it is not released by what we have said, and the matter is severe for the patient: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like the quill of a bird's feather in the fineness of a ray, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: to which there should be a slender tube at its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good knot: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if anything of the wool is superfluous, but insert it into the tube forcefully, like an auger.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and make the patient sit on a seat, and moisten the bladder and its neck with wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the urethra easily, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Then bend it upwards from the part of the navel. Then push the syringe inside it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has already reached the empty thing: and this is not done according to this order, except because the passage, in which it goes, is tortuous.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For the urine will follow the wool.
Then draw it out, and make the urine run through the urinary passage: and repeat with the syringe, and do not cease doing that, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter 59.
For it is deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
And the concave place, in which is that which impels, should be according to the quantity which fills it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, the humidity is drawn out: and when it is impelled, it is expelled with it to a distance: according to what the clepsydra does, by which naphtha is projected, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
Therefore, when you wish to project humidities into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the humidity, and draw with it that which impels upwards, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then insert its end into the catheter, as we have related in the syringe.
Then impel the humidity with that which impels it; for that humidity arrives at the bladder immediately, so that the infirm person feels it. The shape of a slender clyster by which the bladder is clysterized.
Then insert a strong thread into those holes, however they are rolled. Then gather the circle, as an *alsofratu* is gathered: after you put into it what you wish of humidities, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder, by pressing with your hand, until the humidity reaches the bladder.
Concerning the extraction of a stone.
Chapter 60. We have already spoken in the division of the kinds of stone, and its cure with medicines: and I have spoken of the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of all this: and I have spoken of the stone in which operation with the hand and incision falls: and it is a stone generated in the bladder properly: and that which is fixed in the urethra: and I am narrating this with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that a stone generated in the bladder most frequently happens to boys.
And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety: and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs his penis, and labors with it, and often it hangs down. Then it is raised, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them.
And the healing of children is easy, until they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in old men.
In young men, however, it is moderate, in that which is between that: and the one whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if small, the treatment is conversely.
When therefore we arrive at the cure, it is necessary first that we cleanse the patient with a clyster, which draws out all the excrement that is in his intestines; for it sometimes prevents the finding of the stone upon examination. Then let the patient be taken with his feet up, and shaken, and moved downwards: that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or rise from a high place sometimes.
Then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands shall be under his hips, so that the bladder may be entirely sloping downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately with the incision upon it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a grown young man: and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place, of which you wish the incision: and instruct the assistant, that he press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant, that he extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand, that he remove the skin, which is under the testicles in the part from the place where is the incision.
Then insert the cutting spatula, whose form is this.
And cut in that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left buttock: and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide externally, and narrow internally, according to the amount that the exit of the stone from it is not greater.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
And know, that of the stone there are angles and edges, wherefore its exit is made difficult because of that.
And from it there is a smooth one, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is made easy.
Therefore to that which has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
If it does not come out thus, then it is necessary that you operate on it: or that you bind it with a properly made bandage, the end of which is like the moon, which binds the stone and does not slip off it: or that you insert under it a thin instrument, of curved end.
But if you cannot operate on it, then enlarge the opening a little.
And if something of the blood overcomes you, cut it off with a scalpel.
But if there is more than one stone, then first push the largest to the opening of the bladder.
Then cut upon it.
Afterwards push the small one after it: and similarly do if there are more than two.
But if it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut upon it with a large incision.
Because one of two things happens to the patient, either that he dies, or that continuous urinary dribbling occurs to him; because the place does not completely heal.
Truly administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or contrive its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piecemeal.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloes, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place over it a cloth infused with oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot abscess is seated.
Then lay the patient back on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When therefore you have loosened it,  bathe the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs in the wound, and corrosions, and things like that: as if blood were congealed in the bladder, and urine were prevented from exiting it: and this is known from the passage of blood with urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply to every kind with what is suitable from treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment, that you bind the two hips, and bring them together, because of the medicines which are placed on the area.
But if the stone is small, and is in the passage of the penis, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is prevented: then treat it with what I relate before you arrive at incision.
For many times you will be excused from incision by this treatment, for I have already proved it. And it is so that you take a perforator of tempered iron, of which this is the form, a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie with it the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the perforating iron into the penis easily, until the perforator arrives at the stone itself: and revolve the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually: and attempt its perforation, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis.
For it is broken, and comes out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something which prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures.
Then remove it.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and clean the congealed blood which is in the wound.
And the ligature of the thread under the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not return to the bladder: and the other ligature above, except so that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you, when you tie the upper thread, to raise the skin upwards, so that it returns to its completion, and covers the wound, as we said.
Concerning the extraction of a woman's stone.
Chapter LXI.
A stone is rarely generated in women.
But if a stone should happen to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is forbidden because of many methods.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin. And a second is, because you do not find a woman who will uncover herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or has a husband.
A third is, because you do not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially operating with the hand.
And a fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity compels to that, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician, well-skilled: and few are found.
If however you are deprived of that, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a well-taught midwife in women's matters, or a woman who is skilled in some part of this art: therefore make her present, and especially instruct her to do all that you order her from the examination about the stone. Firstly, it is that she should look if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she should constrict it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the sick woman, and investigate concerning the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with the utmost of her strength, until she arrives with it to the hip joint.
Then she should cut upon it at the meeting of the middle of the vulva at the hip joint, on whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting beneath it: and let the incision be small at first.
Then she should insert a probe into that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to a proportionate amount so that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the types of stones are many. For among these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Know therefore its types, so that it may be signified to you by this concerning that which you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place pounded alum, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stopped.
But if a flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been cut: then place powder on the place, and bind it tightly with a suitable bandage: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
Therefore, when the sharpness of the blood has settled down after some days, and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out.
Concerning the incision for watery hernia.
Chapter LXII.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white membrane which is under the skin of the scrotum containing the testicle; and it is called a membrane. And sometimes it is in its own tunic, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it becomes putrid; which is another testicle, and is the skin of the testicle between the white membrane, which we have mentioned; and this does not happen except rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For either its color inclines to yellow, or it is red and bloody, or foul and black, or it is white and watery, and this is what is most common.
For if it is in the white membrane which we mentioned, then the abscess is roundish in length somewhat like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
And if the moisture is in its own tunic, then the abscess is round like part of an egg, and on account of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under the sense of touch.
When therefore you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with an inserted square, the shape of which has preceded.
According to that therefore which comes forth in the track of the inserted instrument, judge about that which is between it.
When therefore we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the patient to be bled if that is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him be laid on his back on something a little high, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit you on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right, who should extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the mirach of the belly.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle lengthwise, up to near the pubis: and let the incision be made according to the straightness of a line equidistant which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white tunic which contains it: and flay it and observe, or beware of this, that you cut it: and let your flaying, by which you flay it, be from the part which hangs with the testicle more: and subtly explore with the flaying according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then perforate the tunic full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water. Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the tunic upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles which contains it: and incise the tunic however it is possible for you to incise it, either with its entirety, or bit by bit, especially its thin side.
For if you do not exquisitely search, in its incision there is no security, lest the water return.
But if the testicle proceeds outwardly from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the tunic, return it.
Then unite the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
But if you find the testicle corrupted by blackness or something else, then it is necessary that you tie off the vessels which are its suspensory ligament, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut away the testicle with its suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle; afterwards treat it as we have said.
But if water has collected in two parts, then know that there are two roots: therefore cut the other part as you did the other equally.
And if it seems to you that one operation is sufficient, then do it: then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside another wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the scrotum: and place doubled cloths on top, which are compresses: and bind them on top with a bandage which has six ends in this manner.
Then two cloths are taken, and sewn together, and filled with carded wool, according to this likeness: and let ends be made by which it is compressed with tow, or moist wool: and let them be gathered together with a tightening in the loin with straps: and one end reaches above the anus to the back, and the second reaches to the part of the hip: and two ends are below over the two hips, and two other ends over the two groins, and let the whole tightening be gathered in the loin with straps.
And sometimes this root is medicated artificially with a cautery in place of incision with iron: and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have narrated: until when white fat containing water is uncovered: then take a cautery, according to this form.
It is similar to a Greek letter.
Then perforate that fat with it, and it is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then extend the fat with hooks, and flay it with a thin, heated cautery, and incise it as much as possible for you, until you eradicate all of it.
And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
If, however, a hot abscess, or blood flow, or something else opposes you during the incision, or during the cauterization, then it is necessary that you treat what opposes you from it with the treatment that is suitable for it, according to what has been stated before.
But if the patient is timid and does not await this operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I relate it: and it is.
When it is ascertained to you by what we said of the signs that the abscess is watery, then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatula; and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a pledget over the place, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water may run out; then treat it until the wound heals.
But if there is opposition to the outflow of water at the time when you perforate it, and this is only because a white membrane makes opposition in the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of the water, then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsies is extracted, the form of which preceded; or add to the operation of the wound a little.
And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or thereabouts.
Therefore, when it collects, then let it be perforated in the same way, and the sick person will pass his days.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy fistulas.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the incision upon this fistula, there is fear leading to destruction in many instances.
Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal is a salvation from it.
And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
I say, therefore, that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed: and this happens from many causes, namely. Either from an acute or acrid superfluity which is poured out to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it happens from a knotting and inflation of the arteries, as its mention has already preceded: or from an inflation of the veins.
Therefore, that which is from them, from the inflation of the arteries, is known by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
That, however, which happens from the inflation of the veins, does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers. And now it is possible that a section is made upon this type, and upon the remaining flesh: and it is, that you cut the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with the white sifach: and free the suspensory ligament from the vessels, and ligate the vessels: and incise the suspensory ligament after you free it from every part of the parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those nascent  fleshes, then it is necessary that you draw out the egg, and incise it. And if there is adhesion between something of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion, and incise it with a round incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you incise all of it, and extract the egg, as we have said. Therefore, when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Ramicis, which is with Vitex.
Chapter LXIV.
A vitex is a swollen abscess, involved in a certain convolution, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and it makes movement and exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear, because of that which preceded its remembrance.
Truly it is necessary that we speak of the operation on it according to what the first [surgeons] did. Therefore I say that it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then incise with a broad, sharp spatula, with a transverse incision in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are uncovered.
Then flay from every side, as we told you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and draw out what is gathered from foul, corrupted humours.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which pus is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle may fall away.
For there is no harm through it.
But if a vein happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed with the vessels on account of this: lest the egg be deprived of nourishment because of the incision, and waste away, or dry up, and there be no help with them.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal fistula. Chapter 65.
Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from the sifach, or from its extension.
And these two types happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach.
It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess which is even towards the deep; therefore, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And its sign when it is from the section of the sifach, because it causes to happen from its beginning a vehement pain suddenly: and it is a diverse abscess, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the outside of the sifach.
And sometimes there exits with the intestine zirbum: and this is named intestinal Ramex, and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes excrement runs into the intestine, and is retained there: and with it is the destruction of the sick person; because it causes to happen a bad pain, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the cure of the species of this sickness with iron there is fear: wherefore it is necessary that the case be avoided in it.
And the method of operation is, that you command the sick person, that he may return the intestine with his hand to the interior of its cavity, if it obeys return.
Then he will be laid supine upon his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin to the upper parts, and cut the whole skin of the testicles lengthwise.
Then fix in the two lips of the incision hooks, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and let the incision be according to the quantity, so that it is possible for the egg to come out of it.
Then flay the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white siphach is uncovered, hard on every side: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphach, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphach, and absolutely loosen with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move with your right hand to the interior the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white siphach upwards, with your left hand: and lift the egg with the siphach to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards: and you loosen the adhesion which is behind with complete solution.
And search with your fingers, so that there is nothing there of intestine involved in the hard white siphach.
But if you find something of it: then push it down to the belly below.
Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads: and insert it near the last siphach, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the ends which protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over others with a figure which is in the manner of a cross: and tie with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles a strong ligament, until it cannot send anything to them from any of the vessels which nourish them: so that a hot abscess does not happen from it.
And place another ligature again outside the first ligature, less than two fingers distant from it.
And after these two ligatures, leave of the siphach, which is under the skin of the testicles, an amount the size of a finger: and cut all the rest according to the roundness, and remove the testicle from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles an incision, from which blood and pus flows: as we have related in what has gone before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound: and apply the ligature which we have described.
And sometimes the white siphach which we have mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing the flow of blood.
For this often happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be moistened with warm water: and place upon it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Concerning a cupping instrument with a nozzle.
Chapter 66.
In this cupping instrument I have not seen anyone who dared to operate on it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is made as we have narrated in the cupping instrument which is with a tube.
That is, to tie off the vessels after the incision above them with ease below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away: and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groins.
Chapter 67.
When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all hours: truly if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And this happens from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groins, as we have said.
That is, because the sifach is extended: then it softens, and the place suppurates, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its account preceded.
And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and it is, that the sick person lies on his back between your hands.
Then cut the place of the suppurating and protruding rupture, with a cut across, according to the amount of three fingers.
Then constrict the alsifak and what is under the skin, until when the white sifach is revealed, which is under the skin which follows it.
Then take a ray, and place it on the prominent place of the sifach, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two prominent places over the end of the ray from the sifach, and connect with a suture one of them with the other: then extract the end of the ray.
And do not cut the alsifach completely, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal fistulas. Then treat it with wound treatment.
Therefore, when you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it heals.
For the sisach contracts, and no prominence is added to the rupture.
And cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to healing.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, on account of which the flesh which is between them is softened, and its appearance is made foul.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked in its treatment, that he make the sick man lie on his back, and incise all the skin which is softened down to the natural skin. Then bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, first remove the superfluity of the softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the suture firm.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
Concerning castration.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law: and because of that it would be permitted to me not to mention it in this my book: and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it: and that he should know the treatment of one to whom it has happened.
And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit thereby, such as rams, he-goats, and cats, and similar animals.
I say therefore that castration is done according to two methods. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and incision.
In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to the touch.
In castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite of two kinds.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite from men is according to two methods.
One of them is that which appears in that which follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like the vulva of a woman, in which are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one kind, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubis like very small male testicles, protruding outwardly: of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them disappears.
Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second kind of men, however, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Concerning the incision of the frenulum, and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXI.
The frenulum is perhaps added to a natural thing, until it is defiled and its appearance becomes foul; and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it expands as in men, and reaches even to coitus.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold the excess of the frenulum with your hand, or with a hook, and incise: and do not go too far in the incision, especially in the depth of the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
The flesh, however, which arises, is flesh which is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it extends outwards in the likeness of a tail: and because of this some at first call the illness a tailed illness.
Therefore it is necessary that we incise it as we incise the frenulum, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the imperforate vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, as it were, the imperforate vulva of a woman, or a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from a preceding illness: and this indeed happens either from added, naturally occurring flesh, or a thin or thick membrane; and it occurs either deep within the uterus, or at its sides, or in its upper or lower part; and it prevents intercourse and conception, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
And its recognition is made by the midwife's inspection, if the obstruction is apparently close.
But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is from a thin membrane, and is close to the two labia: then hasten, and break it.
And it is so that you place pledgets on the two labia.
Then place the index fingers of your two hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread.
Then extend the two labia forcefully until the thin membrane is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and let the woman cohabit each day, so that the place does not heal in another way.
But if the membrane is thick, dense, then it is necessary that you cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is formed from flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it: and have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not close quickly, hold it for several days: and administer a linen pledget, then let it be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And sometimes the birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be incised in this manner: while it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, let no contrariety be made with iron at all.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in the vulva of women.
Chapter 73.
Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the orifices of the veins, until much blood flows from them continually.
When therefore hemorrhoids become old, they become thelil: and I have already spoken in the division of their species, and their signs: and I shall say here which of them receive treatment, and which not.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the sense: then there is no treatment for it with iron.
But those of them which are in the orifice of the womb upon which the sense falls, are those which are treated.
Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cold house.
Then extend the athehelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and incise them from their roots.
Then pulverize upon them at the flow of blood from one of the incisive powders without mastication: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things to them.
Then let him press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, place her in cold water.
But if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over her back.
If therefore blood is drawn off with it, it is good: and if not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts, without scarification.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarath, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the branches of alaulat, that is, aglanter, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the place.
When therefore the abscess is quiet, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth however is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
It is necessary therefore that you incise what appears of it, according to what I said in thelil equally: and treat it, until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of the Exitura which happens in the womb.
Chapter LXXIIII.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and a stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
And I indeed have already discussed all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I discuss in this treatise a hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is of the abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is done with iron.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its throbbing, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it redden: if a sense falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with that which aids in maturation, until when the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which slopes to two seats, and she is reclined, or she is placed on her back, and she brings her feet to the lower part of the belly: and her hips are spread, and she puts her arms under her knees, and ties each with a suitable ligature to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the womb is opened.
Whose form comes in those which are after.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix with a ray the depth of the woman's womb: so that that which enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak woman.
But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you put cushions on the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb is prevented: and it is necessary that she puts the rotating thing, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that she holds the instrument, and that the assistant revolves the rotating thing, until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you put into the wound a linen cloth submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some styptic quality: and put the linen cloth, and extract the section in the depth of the womb.
And place externally on the womb, and on the pubis, clean wool submerged in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then let it be treated after two days with an ointment which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is clysterized with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily, or long birthwort has been boiled: then it returns to the ointment.
But if the wound is hidden internally in the womb, then it is necessary that you abstain from its treatment with iron, indeed treat it with that which we have said in the division.
On the teaching of obstetricians, how live embryos, having emerged in a non-natural form, are treated.
Chapter 77.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the form of a natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman being compressed in her lower parts, and she desires to smell the air, and that which is upon her of the birth is lightened, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is head-first, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the umbilicus. When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
But that which is besides this birth, is unnatural, blameworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus exits on its feet, and its body exits before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hands exit: or its belly exits: and perhaps it is turned over on its neck, and similar things from blameworthy forms.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, skillful in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form of them, and what its nature is, and is signified by it, and is to be relied upon.
When the fetus exits head-first in its natural way, and this is vehement upon the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and steam her vulva with a decoction of fenugreek, and with warm oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and let her break the secundine with it, and cut it with her nail, until that which is in it of moisture flows out: and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman ought to be given a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then instruct her after the clyster, that she be compressed: and make her sneeze with conserve, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will exit immediately.
But if two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary to reduce them gradually with ease.
But if it does not obey in entering, then place the woman upon a seat, and raise her feet upward; then shake the seat upon the ground; and let the woman be held, lest she fall during the shaking.
Therefore if the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remainder of the fetus; and bind its hand with a cloth, and extract it evenly: for it will come out.
The exit of the embryo upon its feet.
When the fetus comes out upon its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards straighten it.
Then let him take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
Therefore when they come out as far as the hips, then instruct him that it be compressed, and make her sneeze with sneezing powders: for it will come out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out with what we have narrated, then return the fetus gradually until you place it according to its natural form.
For then it will come out with an easy exit.
But if it is prevented with all that we have narrated: then take of mallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and beat the whole in a mortar with a good beating: then smear the woman's vulva and the lower part of her belly with it.
Then make her sit in warm water until it reaches her hypochondria.
Therefore, when you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a pessary of myrrh: and apply it.
When therefore the pessary has remained for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze: and hold her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with gentle pressure.
For the fetus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus is over the knees and hands.
When it comes out in this manner, then he will succeed in inserting his hands gradually.
Then the woman will be laid back on her neck, and her feet will hang downwards: and she herself will be lying on the bed, and will clasp her hands.
Then press gradually on her belly.
Then remove what is under her feet from the cushions, until she is prepared in the lower part.
But if the fetus does not come out, then take hold of its feet, and move them with a strong movement.
Then press what is above the hypochondria gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Then let him insert his hands and gradually straighten the fetus; and instruct the woman to strain until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
His hand will be used in the reduction.
But if he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her legs with a strong shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
But if childbirth seizes her, then make her sit on a seat.
Then strive at the reduction of the hand, and equalize the fetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to strain herself until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with its hands extended, and its face is towards its mother's back.
It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually rotate it, and equalize it with ease.
When therefore it is equalized, then place on her vulva that which we have related of oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to move gradually.
When therefore you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean to the right side.
Then instruct her to be compressed: and make her sneeze with sneezing powders.
The exit of the prepared fetus is on the side.
When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your nail, until it is emptied of moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not be retained, and die.
Then push the fetus inwards, until you place it as is fitting: and instruct the woman to compress herself several times: for it itself will come out with an easy exit.
The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born; and sometimes three, and four are born.
However, that is unusual, and rarely happens.
Five, however, is outside of nature, and they do not entirely live: and one afterbirth contains them, however many they may be: and they are separated by a septum, distinguishing between them, attached at the navel of each of them.
And sometimes they exit as a single fetus exits by a natural, easy exit; and they exit by a blameworthy exit, as we have narrated. But if some of them are difficult at birth, and arrive at what we have described from unnatural forms, then treat them as we have narrated: and let there be a skilled midwife, and let her do what she does with ease and slowness, and let her contrive according to every form with that which is prepared for her from skill leading to health.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has been verified by me, that a woman aborting emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore all this ought to be in the knowledge of midwives. For perhaps a similar thing will come to her: therefore let her oppose it with what is necessary.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have mentioned in the division of medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted with any of the accidents from which loss is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid on her back on a bed, with her head inclined lower, and her legs raised: and a servant should hold her from two sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils with marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed mucilage. Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then let her insert it into the womb easily.
Then let her seek with it the place in which to fix hooks on the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend headfirst: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is on its feet, then in its pubis, and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand: and insert it with her hand easily, and fix the hook in some of those places which we have mentioned, until she reaches the empty thing.
Then let it be extended with an equal extension, and let the extension not be according to straightness only, but rather let it be moved to every part, so that its exit is eased: just as is done with a tooth at its extraction.
And it is necessary that that which is between them be softened for the extension.
But if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that she may revolve with them that which is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then let the hooks be changed to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus emerges.
If therefore a hand emerges before other things, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then pull it out until, when it emerges completely, you incise it either at the joint of the sole or at the elbow; and thus you must do in the other hand and in the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction happens to it in its exit, or water is gathered in its head, then it is necessary that he insert a thorny spatula between the fingers, and pierce the head with it, and extract the water; or break it with the instrument which is called *Almisdac*, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similarly, let him do if the fetus is of the nature of a large head, then it is necessary that you cut *algengematu*; or extract it with *misdach*, as we said.
Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out and is constricted at the clavicle, then let it be split until the moisture which is in the chest is poured out.
But if it is not folded, nor does it yield to exit, then cut the head piecemeal, according to what is possible for you.
But if there is an abscess in the lower part of the belly, or there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary that you perforate it until the moisture runs out of it.
If, however, the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
But if it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand; and split the belly or chest until that which is in them runs out.
But if the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand. Therefore if the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand into the depth of the womb, and with it seek the head, and draw it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb; then let her insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it out with them.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot abscess which has happened to it, then it is not necessary that labor be undertaken on it; rather, then it is necessary to administer the effusion of humid, oily things, and apply plasters; and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it be straightened; then let that which we said in the case of a living fetus be administered.
But if that is not possible, then let it be cut piecemeal and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave absolutely nothing of the afterbirth inside.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning hot abscesses which happen in the wombs.
But if a flow of blood should occur, then let her descend into styptic waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
And indeed I myself saw a woman in whose womb a fetus had died; then she was impregnated upon it a second time, afterwards another fetus also died.
Therefore, after a long time an abscess happened to her in her navel, and it swelled until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Therefore I was called to her treatment, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Therefore I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out of the place.
Then several days passed, and another bone came out.
Therefore I was amazed at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Therefore I examined the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and now she lived thus for a long time, and emitted little pus from the place.
And I did not confirm this unusual thing here, except because there is knowledge in it, and help for that which the skillful physician administers with the hand in treatment.
Concerning the forms of instruments necessary in the extraction of a fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the form of a constrictor, by which books are bound, which has two equally sized spindles at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
However, this spindle ought to be more slender than the constrictor; and it ought to be made either of ebony or boxwood.
And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers; and the thickness of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are now fixed to both, whose length is half a palm more or less; and the width of each is about two fingers, more or less.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two spindles.
The form of the spindle by which the matrix is opened.
Another form similar to that, more slender, and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Therefore when you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, with her legs hanging down, open what is between her legs.
Then insert these two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the lower extremity of the instrument between her hips.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount that you wish of the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
The form of another kind of turning which the ancients called the impelling form by which the fetus is impelled.
The form of the Almisdac by which a small head is crushed. The form of a hook having one point.
The form of a hook having two points.
The form of forceps which has saw teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
The form of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
The form of two broad spatulas also.
All these instruments are practiced, and the more their types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the more skilled among men, because of their quantity.
Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, but let them be prepared for you.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
Concerning the extraction of the secundina.
Chapter 78.
When the secundina is retained after childbirth, then you ought to instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
If therefore it exits by this means, it is good.
If not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid; and put into it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamus, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and sage, and cassia lignea, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them over the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end into the mouth of the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
For the afterbirth will exit with ease.
But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to submerge her hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage. Then let her insert it into the vulva, and search for the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she has found it, then let her take it and extend it gradually.
But if it is attached deep within the womb, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until she finds the afterbirth, and extract it gradually and straight, so that the womb does not fall during forceful pulling; indeed, it is necessary that it be moved easily to the right and left sides; then let the amount of pulling be increased.
For then it obeys, and is preserved, and escapes adhesion.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described, treat it with sneezing and with medication from a pot with herbs.
But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself by repeatedly pulling it.
Truly it is necessary that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, be tied to the woman's hip.
Then give her a clyster with tetrapharmacon ointment.
For it will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will come out.
However, when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak woman.
Therefore, suitable fumigations ought to be administered to it.
Some of the ancients, however, have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated for the retention of afterbirth and menstrual blood.
Let it be made from a glass similar to an alembic, or from brass; and let the wide end be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be placed on the coals; let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and repeat another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many boys are born, and their anuses are imperforate, which a subtle membrane has already obstructed.
Therefore it is necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger; and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula; and let her beware of the muscle, lest she touch it.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil upon it.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to defecate.
And now obstruction of the anus happens also from the healing of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore it is necessary that that consolidation be cut, then treated with what we have said of treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Chapter LXXX.
Fistulas which occur in the lower part are a knotting, and a thickness which occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one part: and it is one fistula, or several.
When therefore that knotting becomes old, it opens, and a watery white moisture, or thin pus, flows from it.
And sometimes of these fistulas there are penetrating ones.
And some of these fistulas, when they are penetrating, extend to the bladder and to the urinary passage.
And some of them penetrate to the hip joint and to the coccyx.
However, that by which a fistula penetrating to the anus is distinguished from a non-penetrating one is that you insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the fistula made of air or iron, when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe or a horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
But if you do not feel it completely, nor does anything from excretion, nor flatulence, nor a worm as I said, proceed from the opening, then know that it is non-penetrating; therefore hasten to the cure.
And when a fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary meatus, then its sign is the exit of urine from it, and the prevention of its consolidation by medicines in this place.
If, however, it penetrates to the hip joint or to the hip bone, then its sign is that the probe reaches there if there is no tortuosity in it to the bone; and the finding of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always comes out of it; and that medication is not effective in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity for the foolish physician on whom it is performed. However, in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I relate to you, and I have already proven it: and it is so that the patient lies on his back between your hands; and raise his legs above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Then insert a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
But if the patient feels it around the anus, then you must insert your index finger into the anus.
Therefore, if you feel the probe has already penetrated by itself through what you feel between your finger and the fistula or flesh: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: therefore do not work on it, since there is no cure for it, as we have said.
However, it has been said that the flesh heals in some men, and of the medication by which help is hoped for it, is that you heat a fine cautery according to the size of the fistula, as before, and insert it burning into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat this twice or three times, until you know that all those added, filtered fleshy parts, which are similar to a bird's quill, have been cauterized.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, until the cauterized flesh comes out: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it never heals with any other treatment.
And if a probe emerges, and does not reach your finger, which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh or fat, and you see a fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe which is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered fleshy parts, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing of them remains.
But if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you cut those fleshes: then what is better, and of speedier help, is to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Because cauterization with fire brings together good habits, the burning of those added fleshes, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying of humors.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, or with crushed cabbage leaves, until the place discharges pus, and those burnt fleshes come out in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, generating hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there is astringency and drying.
For when they are restored, then it is healed: and you do not fear a recurrence. But if a fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and is elongated from the superfluity of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a probe, and between you and it is a membrane of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
That is, because one of three methods is used in it: either to cauterize it, as we said: or to cut it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert linen, and treatment from nearby.
And do not proceed far with the incision, lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and there happens to the patient an involuntary discharge of excrement. Then treat it with what we have said. Perhaps indeed it will heal: or you will lengthen that membrane, and cleanse it after you cut it almost to the anus, as we said, either with a probe, or with another instrument of sharp extremity.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues which are in the incision, as far as you can with exploration.
Then attempt the restoration of the whole wound with a suture, and the upper orifice where it is consolidated: and a fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes a fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is at the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, of those preparing hides, according to this form.
And insert into it a thread woven from five threads, and around them.
Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its depth.
If therefore it is penetrating into the margin of the anus internally nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together: and tighten each, and leave it for one or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those fleshes which are between the two ends of the thread are cut, and fall away: then treat the wound, until it is consolidated, and healed.
For it is not in your power to do that because of the muscle, so that you do not cut it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of a spatulite [surgical instrument] with a point by which a fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter LXXXI.
There are hemorrhoids according to two methods.
For they are either within the anus, similar to bladders of coals or plums; or as if they themselves were grape seeds.
And of them there are small ones and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and it is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus are, for the most part, few in moisture, from which flows a yellowish water, or a little blood with a constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is that you should order the patient to strain; and it should be pressed out until it emerges from the anus, and the athelil appear to you.
Therefore, also suspend it with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks do not hold them, because of their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a pledget of woolen cloth, and draw them out with your fingers.
Then incise them, and sprinkle on them after incision some warm powders, that they may stand in place of a cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
But if the anus does not obey evacuation, then give the patient an enema in which there is a little bite, so that what is in the anus may be washed with it, and it may obey evacuation quickly, when the patient strains himself.
But if the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is that you take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and incise them.
Then treat them with what we said, until they are healed.
And whoever abhors incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method.
Take a wound thread, and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the hemorrhoid upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be lateral: and bind the hemorrhoid tightly with a strong binding.
Then knot the thread, and withdraw the needle.
Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: nor tie it, that an excess of blood may flow from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth infused in rose oil, or cerate, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Then leave it until it falls off.
When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments, and the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of fissures.
For they often happen from the dryness of the stool, and the constriction of nature.
When therefore they become old, and medicine does not work on them: then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula, or with your nail, until they become moist, and the upper layer which prevents them from healing is removed from them.
Then treat them until they heal as is necessary.
But if they do not heal: then repeat the process with more force than the first time, until they bleed much, and are flayed; then treat them until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted haemorrhoids, and dry fissures, and ants.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, however, there is a small, rough, filtered, round prominence on the surface of the body.
And they often occur in the hands of children.
And its treatment is that you extend the athelil and incise it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was stated previously with fire, or with a sharp medicine: and now inverted and non-inverted athelil are eradicated with the instrument that I shall describe. An ant, moreover, is also a small, filtered, thick prominence on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when cold finds it, something similar to the biting of an ant is felt in it, and it occurs throughout the body: and it occurs most in the hands.
And its treatment is that you take a small tube from a goose quill, or a strong vulture quill: and place that small tube over the ant, until the circle of the tube contains some of it.
Then rotate your hand with the small tube, until you cut what is around the ant: and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root. And if you wish, do that with a bronze or iron tube, according to this form.
Let the top of the tube be drawn upwards to a rolled-up, deaf-like height, so that its grip and its rotation on the finger may be eased.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was stated previously in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the forms of instruments which are used for clysters in illnesses of the anus, and for the solution of the belly, and for colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast bronze, or of hammered bronze.
And sometimes a small and a large instrument of these types is made, according to those in whom they are administered.
Therefore that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small: and so too should the clysters of those whose anuses are weak or painful.
A large clyster.
A small clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper end to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner: and it should have a constriction so that the bag is tied as you see, and its lower end which is introduced into the anus should be blunt, that is, not open, very smooth, tapering to a point: and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the fingers, and a little thicker, and let the bag in which the medicines are placed be made of an animal's bladder: or of sheepskin, which should be in the shape of a small asofratus: the root of which is one palm.
When therefore the bag is placed in it, let it be tied at the head of the clyster between the two constrictions with a strong binding.
Then clysterize with it.
And this is the form of the bag here depicted, and of the holes. Moreover, the quality of clysterizing with it is this: that you fill the bag or bladder with medicine, which is warmed according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and beware lest it be very hot, or very cold.
Then let the patient be laid on his back, and let him raise his legs upwards; and place under him an inthaan, that is, a leather on which men lie, or a cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or the like.
Then introduce it into the anus easily.
Then let the attendant take the bag with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully until he evacuates all that is in the clyster into the intestine. Then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs to the wall. But if the medicine compels him to evacuate, then let him retain it as much as he can.
And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more effective in helping.
But if you give him a clyster for ailments of looseness of the bowels, and its evacuation is hasty, then repeat the clyster until he is cured.
But if there are haemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very subtle, gentle, of the kind with which children are clysterised.
And this is the form of a subtle clyster, over which the skin is tightly drawn.
Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken in the division concerning the treatment of wounds which was suitable for the book, and I shall here describe their treatment by hand and with medicines according to the completion.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore, the things by which wounds are made are often such as the throw of a stone, or the incision of a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or a piece of wood, or an arrow, and similar things from many things.
Moreover, wounds which are made according to the places of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or neck, or breast, or belly, or liver; and similar members.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may establish that reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, because the recollection of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say, therefore.
When a simple wound happens in the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and it has now broken only the skin: and it is a large wound, and you fear concerning the bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hasten, and immediately bleed the cephalic vein: and do not delay it: and draw from him blood according to the amount of his strength: if nothing prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood which comes forth from the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and coarse foods.
But if something prohibits bloodletting, then let him be reduced in food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess happens to it, a cloth infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
But if you are secure from a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I shall relate shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place on it certain ointments, until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from the incision of a sword, and the like: and its lips do not come together by themselves, then bring them together with suture, according to what I shall relate in the wounds of the belly concerning their suture.
But if the wound is already bared from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspensory: then incise it.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as are heads [of grain], and boiled wheat, until it is like pottage: and things similar to these.
But if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then incise all the putrefied part, and cast it away: then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
If therefore you find it uncut, then cut it with a spatula, or tie it.
But if necessity demands when that which we have said does not help, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops.
Method of incarnative powder.
Take one part frankincense, and two parts dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: let the whole be ground very finely, and sifted: and let the wound be filled with it, and bound tightly, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it over with lint, and leave it, and do not unbind it while it remains, so that it may not suppurate.
For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment and that of a head wound when it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck is cut, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to be done except to avoid treating it with something that produces strong stypticity, such as verdigris and vitriol, and similar things.
Because they harm nerves and constrict them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most superior of the members; and let that which heals it be from mild medicines, such as lime washed with fresh water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with fresh water; and the remaining mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer a suture; or draw together its edges with powders.
Then treat it until it heals.
But if the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus is already gathered, then perforate it in a more depressed place in it.
But if an artery has already been cut in the wound, and a flow of its blood has resulted, then separate or cut it and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the throat, or the whole, have been cut, and the al-haudegi have been saved, then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture over the tube of the throat, and do not touch the throat itself, but smooth it and restore it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments which have astringent and drying properties, until it is healed.
But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and what is not loosened, leave it until the wound putrefies, and the separation and alleviation of its discharge occurs.
But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder which I have described.
But if bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that whose treatment is recalled in its chapter.
Chapter LXXXVI.
Therefore if air escapes from the wound when the sick person breathes, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder on it at first, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depth, and return to the heart, and kill the sick person: but put on it attractive ointment, and dissolve it twice a day.
But if you do not have ointment at hand, then place old linen in the opening of the wound, so that it may absorb what comes from it of humors: and make the sick person sleep on the wound, so that what gathers in it may flow out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wounding, and the patient has not experienced spasms, nor a bad trembling of the heart, nor shortness of breath, and you see his other conditions to be good: then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore treat it with linen bandages and the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it always opens up again, then know that a fistula has formed.
Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what preceded concerning suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and fragments have broken off from it: then explore the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction is thereby eased.
Moreover, the judgment in the treatment of other wounds occurring in the other members is the judgment that we have spoken of.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestine, and their exit.
Chapter LXXXVII.
The rupture which happens to the belly is great, medium, and small.
Therefore, from a large one sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, protrudes.
Therefore, their replacement and their suture is more forceful and more difficult.
And a small rupture is also made difficult in another way.
It follows therefore that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hasten in their replacement to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and thickened: therefore its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore, on account of this, a medial disruption of disruptions is better: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in those two types.
Know that the suture of the vein is according to four methods.
Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen, and for the suture of the other wounds of the body: and two other sutures are properly shared by the remaining wounds.
Nevertheless, they are more proper with the suture of the abdomen: and I will tell you each one with explanation and clarification. Therefore I say that when a wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out of it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of two methods.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the coldness of the air.
When therefore it is so, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a cloth moistened in warm water alone.
Or boil in water squill, and cyperus, and spica, and bathe the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does this: and it is better than water alone in resolving inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow, or marsh-mallow has been boiled.
For by it its entry is eased with a small thing.
But if its return is hindered after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument with which haemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than incision: and compulsion to incise is not done after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Let one part of it which is twisted be sharp, and the other part of it not sharp, and let the thin end not be with the thinness of a spatula, but rather be somewhat blunter: and it is that which is similar to a cautery, as you see.
Therefore when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible upon it: because it is better.
But when the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
And so it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
But in small wounds, put it according to what is prepared for you.
Then make so that there is present between your hands a pious minister who holds the whole rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Then uncover from it to him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the manner of the common suture of one.
And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the size of the wound.
Then leave from the extremity of the rupture the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle except that you insert into it thread at two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the sifac which is under the skin from the insides, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the sifac: and four rows are made.
Then tighten with doubled thread around the needle several times from the two parts together, until the two lips of the wound are brought together with decent tightness.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix in them another needle: afterwards sew it with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with as many needles as you need, until you complete the tightening of the whole wound.
And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: because thin needles very quickly cut the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in two extremities of the skin very close together: lest the flesh be quickly cut, and the wound be opened before its consolidation, and they not be lengthened also with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from consolidation.
Then cut off the point of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient in his sleep: and put on them small cushions of cloth on every side, which hold the points of the needles: and leave them, until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And indeed this kind of suture with needles is thus more suitable in small wounds.
Because one needle, or two, or about that many, suffice in their suture.
The second suture however is common, so that you join together with the suture four extremities: two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fascia at one time, with a needle on which is wound thread equal in fineness and thickness.
Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, bring back the needle from the part from which you began the same, so that the twisted thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is like the seam of a cloth with which cloths are sewn together, and put between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture men know.
And with this suture I sewed up a wound which had happened to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than one palm: and there had come out from the intestines about two palms of the middle intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the abdomen.
Therefore I reduced it after its intestine had stood outside the wound twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in the space of about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived after that many years, occupied in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor anything of medicines, was found.
Therefore I placed old linen on the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey-water, until it was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper to the subject.
And it is so that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Therefore, when the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle going according to the length and breadth of the whole body: leave the end of the sifac on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate the other end from the inner part to the outer at the other end of the mirach.
Therefore, when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this way at the same end of the mirach from the outer part to the inner: and leave the end of the sifac, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration by which you make it penetrate into the sifac at the end of the mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end which is from the sifac on the other side, and draw the needle out of the skin which it penetrated.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the end of the sifac which is on the other side, with this end of the mirach: and draw it out of the skin which is on its side, and do that once, and again: and do it turn after turn, until you sew the whole exterior according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that you sew the suture of the skins as they sew skins: so that you sew the sifac once from one part to one end of the skin: and that you leave it another time from another part, until you complete it.
The second kind of proper suture, which Galen said.
This speech of his is narrated, so that you sew it according to the likeness, in which way some physicians sew, so that they join each part to its corresponding part naturally suitable: and they apply the end of the sifac to its other end, and the end of the mirach to its other end.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
It is necessary that you fix the needle in the end of the mirach nearest to you on the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that alone: and you leave the two ends of the sifac.
Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside into the two ends of the sifac, namely on both sides.
Then turn both, also make them penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other ends of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture whose mention preceded.
This is therefore also the word of Galen.
And some said.
The suture of the abdomen is straightened with two needles.
That is, to insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew hides equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen: then its suture is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen.
The judgment, however, of the medication of the wound, is the judgment of the other wounds.
That is, because when you obtain a fresh wound with its blood, before the air changes it, and you reduce the intestine, and its own, and you fit it: then put on incarnative powder.
But if the air has already changed the wound: then put on it certain ointments which are present to you, until they produce pus: and the threads fall out, and the sifac and mirach consolidate.
Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
But if medicines are not present to you, then immediately put on it, from the time it begins to emit pus, old lint: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
But if you fear that the wound will communicate with the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary that you submerge soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil: and put it in the area around the groin, and under the armpits.
And if he feels pain, or prickling, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then administer an enema with astringent, black, warm wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and has become an exit penetrating to its concavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and that which is from the small intestine, of more difficult healing.
Moreover, the intestine that is called the jejunum does not admit healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is an intestine, and you obtain it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed, and it has now become green, or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place which is blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For in the intestine are veins and arteries.
Then incise that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its traction is relieved upon you, and its extraction in the case of the intestine, and the emission of pus from the wound.
Concerning a wound which occurs in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it may be restored in some men: therefore, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a thrust of a lance, and the wound was on the right of the stomach, and the wound was old: and a fistula was made, and excretion and flatulence came out of it.
Therefore I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until it was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place now consolidated, I feared for the patient, that some evil accident might befall the patient in his belly: and no evil accident befell him from that.
And he remained in better condition, eating and drinking, and copulating, and he entered the bath, and he exercised in his diets.
And now some experienced men have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine, and it is small: then it is necessary that it be ligated in this manner.
And it is that you take ants with large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of those ants which have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
Therefore, when it seizes upon it, and clenches its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and is not loosened.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the size of the whole wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm whatsoever happens to the patient. And now it is possible that the intestine may also be tied with a fine thread: which has been wiped clean from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is so that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is much thinned.
Then tie a fine linen thread around its end.
Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then return it to the rupture. And this method of suture with ants and intestine, is only according to the way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy except reduction, nor is its healing at all complete.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas and fistulae.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that every wound or abscess when it becomes old and ancient, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always emits pus, and is not incised: then it is universally named fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula indeed is, according to the truth, a filtered, hard, white nodule: with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And it is in some hours moist, which emits pus.
And perhaps the moisture is split in some hours.
And sometimes this moisture is much, and is little: and is thick, and is thin.
And I already premised in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which is not healed, nor does flesh grow in it, is not that except because of one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the paucity of blood in the body: or because of its bad quality: or because between it, and upon its lips is hard flesh, preventing the birth of flesh: or because there is much dirt and filth: or because the ulcer in itself is putrid, and the matter which is emitted from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its cure: or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or by a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which difficult digestion of illnesses takes place, and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed there: or because in it is one bone, or a number of bones.
And I already showed all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Know therefore, that fistula happens in all the members of the body.
For of them are fistulas which reach to large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sifac: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the compound joints by composition: such as the hand, and the foot: and of them are those which go to the proximity of a principal member, and similar things.
Therefore which of these fistulas is according to this manner, is of illnesses difficult of healing, and does not receive a cure, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
But if there is of fistulas some whose depth does not reach to these places which I said: and you hope, and are confident in its cure, and wish to arrive at the knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the fistula extends according to straightness, and search it with it.
But if in the fistula there is tortuosity, then investigate it with a probe of thin lead.
Because lead, with the softness of its body, is alleviated, and is bent around the tortuosity.
But if the fistula is having many orifices, it is not possible for you to signify upon it with a probe.
Therefore, inject a clyster into one of its orifices.
For the moisture by which you inject a clyster into it, goes towards the other orifices, and runs out of them.
Then carefully inquire in whatever way is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the concavity of the fistula is distant or near; or whether it is one fistula which has many orifices, and stand over all that, with the greatest strength of yours: with your questioning, by which you question the infirm, and the finding of pain upon compression with your hand upon the place, and similar signs and causes happening to an abscess.
When therefore you have stood over all those things with true observation, then proceed to the cure with confidence: and it is, that you consider then, if the fistula is near at hand, appearing, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then cut the fistula as is premised from my account, and remove what is in it of filth, and corrupt flesh, that which grows in its orifice from flesh or pus, and similar things: and cure it, until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight: then it is necessary that you cut it deep as much as is possible for you.
Then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then apply linen cloths wrapped in sharp medicines: and introduce them up to the concavity of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron: do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by that, then cauterize it as we have described.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed for you: then investigate it, and cut it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you, from vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
If therefore bone is detected, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which makes flesh grow, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed, and it emits pus as it did before: then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore investigate it a second time, and carefully perform its scraping, and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it heals, it is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
But if a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for it.
But if there are many bones, then carefully perform the extraction of them all, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If however something of the humors opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in their incision: then incise those humors and the flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then place something on the wound that will cause it to putrefy: and leave it until what is around those bones of flesh and humors has putrefied.
And keep the wound so that it does not heal.
And let the incision which you made in your operation be constricted.
Rather, if you fear, place upon it a cotum submerged in crushed sulfur with oil: or a cotum submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those humors putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction will be easier.
But if it is one large bone, such as a bone of the leg, or a hip bone, and similar to these, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then shave it with the utmost care, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Then restore the wound.
But if what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and to cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated. And I tell you a case which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may put it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a man, young in age, about thirty years old, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause which moved upon it within the body, that is, from the interior parts, until the materials reached the leg, and it became an abscess, a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Therefore, time passed with him, with the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and much material flowed from it.
And its treatment was delayed, until the leg became fistulated, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and the humors of the body.
Therefore, many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of surgery among them, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials which flowed from those openings in great quantity: indeed, the whole body of the man was now wasted, and his color was yellow.
Therefore I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to reach each other from all parts of the leg. Therefore I probed, and cut above one of those openings, until I uncovered part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already corroded, and blackened, and putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore I sawed what was revealed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and sawed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidative medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and healed: and this iteration in its operation, and section of it, was not necessary except because of the disposition of the weakness of the infirm, and the smallness of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death: because there happened to him at all hours from the superfluity of evacuation bad fainting spells.
Therefore he healed with a complete healing: and firm flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he behaved in his dispositions: and it did him no harm at all in walking.
But if a prominent bone already fractured in the body: then it is necessary that you saw it, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligament, and tie it to the extremity of the prominent bone: and order someone to pull it upwards: and place another ligament of thicker wool than the first ligament. Then tie it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood, or a board, decently under the bone below: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting the corrupt flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be a little over the corrupt place, so that corruption is not in the hollow of the bone: and it does not appear to the sense in its appearance, and compels another sawing in its place. But if the bone is corrupt, and is not prominent, but rather one part of it is continuous with another part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in part of it: then uncover the flesh from all parts completely.
Then place wood underneath.
Afterwards saw it from the first side, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other side: and let the sawing be a little longer than the corruption, as we have said.
But if the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupt joint itself, and saw the bone where it is continuous on the other side.
If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy for it except abrasion.
But if the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand, or in the metatarsus of the foot: then the matter is very difficult.
Truly it is necessary that you investigate how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever method is possible for you, and with whatever instrument is rectified for you: when it does not oppose you, a vein or nerve.
And know that cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their thinness, and their size, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their softness.
Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.
And know that these operations signify to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long study.
And the knowledge of the methods of this art, a witness to the methods of illnesses: for then you will find by yourself that which is suitable for it from the instruments for every infirmity.
The shape of the saw.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of another saw.
This depicted saw shape is properly made. Let its upper bow be made of iron sharpness, and its handle of boxwood, and let it be pyramidally and properly made.
The shape of a joint rasp.
Let the head of this rasp be according to the shape of the head of a star nail; and let its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not suitable except to rub with it the heads of joints when they are corrupted, or a bone is ample and large.
The shape of a larger rasp.
The shape of a medium rasp.
The shape of a wide rasp.
The shape of a rasp in which there is a concavity.
The shape of another, slender rasp.
The shape of another rasp with a curved end.
The shape of a small, slender, thin rasp.
The shape of a rasp with which bones are cut.
The shape also of a large rasp.
This is similar to a saw, and the end is like a saw; it is shown in many places because of the sawing of bones.
The shape of a rasp which is suitable for rasping that which has been perforated from bones.
Its end is triangular, of sharp points.
It is made of Indian [material].
And similarly it is necessary that all those things which we have spoken of be made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
Extremities putrefy, either from an extrinsic or intrinsic cause.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the cure does not help, and you see the corruption cutting into the limb, which nothing repels, then it is necessary that you incise that limb until the corruption is reached, so that the infirm person may be saved thereby from death, or from a harm which is greater than the loss of the limb.
And a sign that this has happened is that the limb blackens until it putrefies: which fire has burned it, or it putrefies after the blackness, until that putrefaction is incised until that which follows that limb, and creeps into the whole body.
Therefore hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the striking of certain poisonous things: such as a sea scorpion, and a viper, and a weasel, and similar things.
If therefore the corruption or blow is in the extremity of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, that it may proceed to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then incise it from the root of the hand, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold in the forearm.
And if it invades it, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint. But if the corruption passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the sick person.
And to administer beyond that from a cure, is a matter of skill.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then incise it at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the instep, then incise the whole foot.
But if it ascends to the knee, then incise the leg at the knee joint.
But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except giving up, and leaving the sick person to death.
And the method of incising a limb, or sawing it, is to bind a ligament below that which you wish to incise; and bind another ligament above the place.
And let an assistant pull one ligament downwards; and let another assistant pull the other ligament upwards.
And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then let it be incised, or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw not touch the healthy area; and let there happen to the sick person an added injury, and a hot abscess.
But if there happens an internal flow of blood while you operate, then cauterize the place quickly; or put on it some powders which staunch blood.
Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded member with a bandage suitable to it, and take care of it until it is healed.
And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same event that I tell you.
Which is, because there happened in his foot a blackness, with a burning which is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Therefore the man hastened of himself, after he saw the corruption falling upon the member with its vehemence, which he found from its pain and burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed for him, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I put on the hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to proceed into another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore he called me, to cut off his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from myself concerning the repulsion of that excess: and I also feared for him concerning the cutting off of his hand, death.
Because the man's strength was above the case.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and it came to me concerning him, that he hurried, and cut off his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought this narrative, except that it may be a help concerning that which falls under the kind of this sickness: and that it may be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be acted.
Concerning the care of fistulas, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Chapter XC.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it makes a collection of pus: then it breaks or is perforated, and what is in it of pus goes out, and a hollow place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has already been thinned: and it does not arrive at the last in its corruption, nor does it press on a bone, nor on a nerve, nor on a ligament: it deserves to be called a sinus: and it is not called a fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption presses on any of these members, then it is called a fistula, or zuken.
And its cure is that you incise all that skin as it is rolled up: and especially when it is thinned, and made like cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin adheres, and that last corruption does not follow from it: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster: and it is, that you should consider the sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus which is emitted from it is foul-smelling: then clysterize it with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, to be mixed in a vessel: and they are to be boiled over a fire until the medicine reddens: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take of it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the sinus with it: and bind its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Then draw it out by expression: do this for as many days, until the sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when you do not have this medicine present: and it is, that you should take the ash of vine wood, or ash from holm oak wood: and pour water over it.
Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
But if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which something of crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Or clysterize him with mixed honey and wine, because it is a property of honey to cleanse and wash; and wine makes it adhere to the sinus, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has now been removed: then clysterize him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
And it is so, that you take of diafinicon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or clysterize him with certain other medicines and ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
But if the orifice of the sinus is constricted, so that the clyster cannula does not fit: then dilate it slightly with iron; or place in it a linen strip wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is dilated.
And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring together its lips with a suture: and leave from it an amount into which the clyster can enter without addition.
And similarly if its orifice from which pus runs is elevated to the upper parts: then incise it in a lower place which is in it, so that the pus runs down from it: because pus, when constricted in the depth of the sinus, prevents flesh from being generated in it.
But if it is not possible for you to incise the sinus around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation by which pus flows from it easily, according to what is prepared for you.
Try that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidative medicines which are placed on the wound, suitable to what you wish.
And spread them on a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a quantity that the whole sinus is covered.
Then incise with scissors in a straight line with the opening of the sinus a hole, a little larger than the opening of the sinus.
Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it at a distance from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be eased: and do not remove the large cloth, except after some days at one time.
But the one which is over the opening of the sinus, is the one which you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may come out: and so that you may know whether that which flows from it is much or little: or digested, or undigested.
And with this again consider the place of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is no abscess in it.
When therefore your medication is extended in this way, and you see the matter which comes out over the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adherence: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment. But if a subtle virus comes out of the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and of them there are some who act contrary to that.
But if undigested pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adherence of the sinus is delayed, and its matter is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, truly let the physicians do, so that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their virtue: such as diafinicon ointment, when an excess of addition from zegi is added to it.
And of the last things by which it is cured, is that you take diafinicon ointment, and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it old wine equal in its substance.
Then mix it with it, and use it.
And now it does something similar to this action, when you do not have diafinicon ointment present, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and you use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Then spread over it a cloth, and bind it over the sinus: and spread with honey which you have boiled until it has thickened: and powder over it the spices, and place over it a cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes there is administered in it long birthwort, and roots of the celestial lily, and there is lily: and herb flour, and centaury.
Use them simple, or compounded, grind them, and sift them: and powder over the honey which I have mentioned, and use it.
But if the matter of the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment: then know that in its depth there is corruption: or it now makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what has been stated before. Concerning the treatment of a whitlow and a rubbed nail, and the incision of an added finger, and section.
Chapter XCI.
A whitlow is an abscess which arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it arises in the other fingers.
When therefore its matter is prolonged, and its treatment is neglected, and it becomes abscessed with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the bone, until it has a foul odour: and the extremity of the finger becomes wide, and its colour becomes dark.
When therefore you treat it, with that which we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you incise with an iron instrument all the excess which remains of the nail.
Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
For cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail now compress the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin probe under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards: and incise that flesh easily, and apply to what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until the whole of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption now penetrates to the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone, and extract it: for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
But if you see corrosion and corruption advancing in the finger, then incise it at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if attrition or percussion should happen to the nail, and intense pain results, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, with a transverse section from above downwards.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause thereby very intense pain to the patient, and it will be the cause of the growth of added flesh in the place.
Then treat the place with that which soothes pains.
Moreover, the added finger which is born in some men's hands, perhaps is wholly fleshy; and perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them are born at the root of a joint, or its growth is in some knots of the finger.
Therefore, that which is born in some knots of the finger, is not moved; and that which is born near the joint of the finger, perhaps is moved.
Therefore, the cutting of that one which is fleshy among them is easy.
That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of that whose growth is at the root of a joint is difficult.
Therefore abstain from its incision.
But in that which grows in a finger at the last knuckle, then it is necessary that you first cut its flesh with a round incision down to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Now, the adhesion which happens to fingers together, very often happens either from a person's birth, that is, he is born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore it is necessary that you cut that adhesion until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between them linen cloths, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly adhere, and separate them; or place between them a thin lead plate until the place is healed as it should be.
And similarly if adhesion happens to some fingers with the palm, then cut that adhesion, according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of the vitiated part.
Chapter XCII.
Varicose veins are twisted, thick veins, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body; and their occurrence is most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and who carry burdens.
Therefore it is necessary that you administer a shaking of the body from black bile, several times with a strong shaking.
Then you should bleed the patient in the basilic vein.
The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out.
And the other method is that the vein is raised, and the whole thing is drawn out.
The incision of it is according to this method.
First bathe the leg with much warm water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the leg of the sick person from the upper part of his hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the vein further down until a quantity of blood comes out which you see to be sufficient, and which the strength of the sick person can bear.
Afterwards bind it: and tell him to abstain from foods which produce black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and this harms the sick person.
The elevation of it is in this manner.
Shave the leg of the sick person, if there is much hair on it.
Then put him in a bath; or rub his leg with warm water until it reddens and the veins swell; or let him take vigorous exercise, if a bath is not available, until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the skin in a line with the vein lengthwise; either at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein on all sides until it appears to the senses: and at its appearance, you see it red tending toward blackness.
When it is freed from the skin, you see it white as if it were a string.
Then insert a spatula under it until it is raised and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt hook gently.
Then make another incision near that incision by three fingers.
Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Then raise it with spatulas as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did before.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need it.
Then raise it, and incise it with the last incision near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision which is above it.
And do this until you pull it out from the incision which is above, or higher than all the incisions, until when it comes out entirely: then incise it.
But if it does not obey you to be pulled out and raised: then insert a needle with strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert a probe under it: and rotate your hand to every part, until it comes out.
And beware that it is not incised.
For if it is incised, it becomes very difficult for you to raise it, and harm from it enters upon the patient.
Therefore, when you have pulled it out entirely: then place upon the place of the wounds wool submerged in wine and rose oil, or oil: and take care of it until it is healed.
But if the vine is contracted, having a tortuosity to which there is a winding to the parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you split it in every part of its tortuosity, and the places of its winding.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you raise it entirely: and beware in your section upon it lest you cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to raise, or extract it.
Therefore preserve your prudence.
The form of the incision by which the vine is healed.
The form of the blind hook.
It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor is it of a sharp extremity, so that it does not wound a vein: and it is of thick, gentle curvature: because if it were thin, it would cut a vein by its thinness: indeed let it have superfluous thickness, as we have said.
Concerning the extraction of the vein of the leg. Chapter XCIII.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Algezira, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little softness, that is, in which neither herb nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction which happens under the skin, just as serpents and ascarid worms, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh, happen within bodies.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a vehement inflammation happens in the leg.
Then the place blisters.
Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap over it a piece of lead, whose weight is from one and a half drachmas to two drachmas, and knot it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
As often therefore as something comes out of it to the exterior, wrap it in lead, and knot it.
But if it is prolonged much, then cut a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it out by the roots before it comes out completely.
Because if you cut it, it contracts, and enters into the flesh: and it causes an abscess, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be gently treated, and drawn out little by little, until it comes out to its end, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein indeed there comes out in some men that which is in its length five palms and ten.
And now it has come to me, that it came out of a man twenty palms long.
But if it is cut into you at the time of your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening, and perforate it with a long opening, together with the body, until all that is in it of matter is evacuated: and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Therefore cure it, as we said in the division, and with what has been said before.
Concerning the incision upon worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
Chapter XCIV.
This illness is called in a certain land among us bovine illness, because, for that reason, it happens very often to cattle, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and flesh.
And it goes throughout the whole body, ascending and descending; and its movement from member to member is shown to the senses, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and exits.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Just as worms and serpents, that is, earthworms and ascarids, occur in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malignancy.
Because when it goes in the body and rises to the head and arrives at a place, then perhaps it opens there and exits, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, then this is not done except at its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore it is necessary that you bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
But if it penetrates deep into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies.
And what is more feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said. But if you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
And it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body, with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision upon the illness Nakir.
Chapter 95.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain which happens in certain members: then it is changed from member to member.
And I indeed already saw it, according to what I relate to you.
I was called to a weak woman in certain villages.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's rope.
And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling proceeding with speed, just as a worm proceeds, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be: so that it is like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Therefore the pain receded from that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran into the remaining body, until it arrived in the other arm.
Then she told me that it revolved in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Therefore I was amazed at the speed of its change from member to member.
And indeed I had not before seen this illness with my own eyes in this way.
Nevertheless I saw many who found pain shifting from member to member: and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think that it is, except that it is because the woman was one of those who are from villages of dry bodies and exposed veins: hence therefore that windy condition appears to the sense as changed.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
Therefore when you wish its cure, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to your eye, as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and cut above it until that constricted wind escapes: and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels winds, and it expels them with fetid pills, and pills of serapinum, and the like.
Concerning the extraction of arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in which they fall in the body.
Their diversity is this: for among them are those which have large and small points: and concave and blunt ones.
And among them are those which have three points.
And among them are those which have barbs.
And among them are those with star-shaped heads.
Those, however, which are according to the members in which they fall, are according to two methods.
For either the members are of the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar things.
Therefore when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death, which I shall relate to you later, appear to you, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in most dispositions.
And when those bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and exits the membrane which is above the brain, are: because there happen from it vehement thirst, and dimness of vision, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of bile.
And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And a white moisture similar to pus comes out from the place of the wound.
And something like the wateriness of flesh comes out of it.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs, however, of an arrow when it falls into the heart, are: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels with it as if it were fixed in something hard, not in something empty.
And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of the pulse; and black blood runs from the wound.
And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Know therefore, that death approaches without doubt.
And a sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung, is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck become suppurated, and the color of the sick man changes.
And he breathes out a large, deep breath; and he seeks the intake of cold air.
But if the arrow falls on the membrane which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is great shortness of breath with intense pain, with sighing: and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the belly, and is fixed in it: something of the faeces comes out of the wound, or pus, or intestine which is already broken.
Therefore there is no hope in his cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
But if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the patient: then know that it is mortal.
The remaining members, however, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and armpit, and the vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to many dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve: and the arrow is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I have seen of the being of these arrows, that you may signify by that concerning your cure.
That is, because an arrow fell on a certain man in the lachrymal duct of his eye, at the root of the nose.
Therefore I extracted it from him on the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell on him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained from it only a small extremity, with which it adhered to its wood: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no barbs.
Therefore the Jew was healed, and no evil accident happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one which has barbs.
Therefore I made an incision upon it between two guide-strings: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Therefore I worked delicately with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed him, and nothing of his condition had changed, I made an incision upon the arrow: and I worked upon it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no ill happened to him.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound had closed over it.
After therefore seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman into whose belly an arrow had fallen, and the wound had closed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and none of her condition changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound closed, and it remained, causing him not much pain: and many things similar to these.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's chieftains, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already deviated a little to the right side: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Therefore I was called to his treatment after the arrow injury for three days.
Therefore I found the arrow wound very tight.
Therefore I searched for it with a thin probe, and did not feel it: and he indeed felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
Therefore I hoped that that prick was from the point of the arrow.
Therefore I plastered the place with a plaster which had attractive and digestive power, trusting that the place would suppurate, and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut over it: and nothing significant happened in the place indicating that the arrow had reached there.
Therefore I persisted with the plaster on him for many days: and nothing happened, and the wound healed meanwhile: and he remained weak from the extraction of it for a space of days, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose.
And he told me that.
Therefore I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it was opened: and when I carefully probed it, I felt the point of a thin arrow adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound by means of that sharp medicine, until the point of the arrow visibly appeared to us: and about four months passed with him.
Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield to extraction: then I did not cease to refine and devise ways for it, until I began on it one day with neatly made forceps, as their form will appear at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore I restored it, and the wound consolidated, and the patient was healed with complete health: nor did anything whatsoever harm him.
And I relate to you the manner of extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that as a rule and explanation concerning that which I have not said.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not grasped with narration: nor does the book comprehend that, and the prudent artisan compares a little with much: and with that which is present, to that which is absent: and finds a new operation, and a new instrument in the descent of strange things of this art when they happen.
Therefore I say that arrows do not come forth from the limbs in which they are fixed except in two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Or by the opposite of the other part.
And that which goes out from where it entered, is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and it is pulled, and it goes out.
But if it does not obey exit at the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its traction is lessened, and its exit.
And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and it does not obey you for exit, then leave it also for some days: and repeat it with traction and movement every day, until it goes out.
But if it does not obey you for exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself on every side with a thin drill, until the arrow is widened.
Then draw it, and pull it out.
But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and it has already proceeded into one ventricle of the brain, and some of those accidents which I have mentioned appear from the sick person: then abstain from the traction of the arrow, and leave it, until its being is equal after days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate as far as the sifach: and the sick person remains for some days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him: then be ingenious in the traction of the arrow and its extraction.
But if it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you for traction: then administer a drill around the arrow, as I have narrated to you: then treat the place, until it is healed.
But if the arrow is now hidden in a place of the body, and is hidden and concealed from sense: then search for it with a probe.
But if you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
But if you cannot operate on it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then incise over it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
But if it has barbs by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them on every side, with every means by which you can, and means, if it cannot be done by the release of the flesh in the fracture of the barbs and their twisting, until it comes out.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whichever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps to all parts, until you make it come out: and the finest things with the finest subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you, and its own extraction.
But if you cannot operate on it within one hour, then leave it for a few days, until those things which are around it become putrid.
Then repeat it: for the swelling will be lessened. But if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we have said concerning treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from the incision of a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And administer the method in every way that is possible for you for the removal of the arrow: and let it be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that, when you pull out the arrow, you make it weak according to the shape according to which the arrow was at the time of the wounding.
Because it is more helpful.
But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the shapes.
But an arrow which emerges from the opposite of another part, or something of it already proceeds to the exterior, or the point of the arrow makes a swelling by sensation from the upper part of the nearby skin, and you see it prominent: therefore cut above it, and let the incision be according to the quantity that the forceps can grasp there.
Then pull it out: for it itself is made easy to exit.
But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow is impressed into the bone, and widens itself: then pull it out.
And if not: leave it for several days; then repeat it until it comes out.
But if the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it with it.
But if the wood has fallen off, and you wish to administer a push: then introduce a concave instrument to it, so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow: then push it with it.
But if the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
For the arrow is lightened by it.
But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which is the poison, if it is possible for you.
Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
But if the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near to that which you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then sew up the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the shape of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to a bird's beak, which are made like iron: when they seize upon the arrow, they do not let go of it.
And many kinds are made of them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the size of the wound, and its narrowness.
The shape of the concave pusher.
And the shape of the blunt pusher.
This is of a blunt end like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be pushed with it.
The end of this concave pusher is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it and its pushing may be eased.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
Chapter 97. The veins to be phlebotomized, whose use is customary in the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbae; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the tip of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, moreover, which are bled in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the outer side: and the common people call it the vein of the head.
And the Dark one.
And there is the Median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the Basilic, and it is situated on the inner side: and it is also called Titillicaris.
And the common people call it the vein of the belly.
And the rope of the arm, and it is situated above the fold: and it is in this that bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb by clear demonstration.
And the Salvatella: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb from the outer side.
And the second is the Saphena: and its place is at the heel from the inner side.
And the vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel from the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Indeed, phlebotomy of the two veins which are behind the ears is beneficial for chronic catarrhs, and hemicrania, and sahafati, and bad chronic head ulcers.
And the manner of phlebotomizing it is according to what I relate.
And it is so that the head of the sick person is shaved: and his occiput in the place of the two veins is rubbed with a rough cloth with a good rubbing.
Then let the sick person bind his neck with a band until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head.
Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there mark with a cautery.
Then take a lancet phlebotom, and it is that which is called Incidens.
Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the phlebotom reaches the mouth.
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and incise the vein with the skin with an incisive incision.
And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or about that: and let out as much blood as you wish.
Then bind it with pledgets, and leave it until it is healed.
And already the incision and cauterization of them preceded in the beginning of the book.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
Indeed, the phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples is a help for chronic hemicrania, and a bad toothache, and persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp effusions to the eyes. And the manner of phlebotomizing them is according to what I relate to you.
Let the sick person strongly tighten his neck until two veins appear manifestly to the sense of sight: and let their pulse be demonstrated under your finger.
Then mark them with cautery.
Then raise the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the cutting phlebotome underneath, and raise the vein upwards.
And incise it, as you did in the other two veins: and make the blood run according to the quantity of your need. Then loosen the constriction of the sick person, and place your finger on the vein for one hour.
Afterwards put a pledget and lint on it, and bind it above with a strong bandage: and leave it until it heals.
And now the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction have preceded in the beginning of the book.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
The benefit, however, of phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead is, after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, for old facial ailments: and for hemicrania, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is as I relate to you.
The infirm person constricts his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument which is called a Fossorium.
Whose form is this.
Place the prominent point which is on the head of the Fossorium upon the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with another thing in its manner: and let the blood run according to the quantity which you wish.
Then loosen the perforation of the infirm one, and bind it until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome.
However, it is not necessary that the phlebotome be of a sharp extremity, like the other phlebotomes, but rather of a wide extremity.
And phlebotomize it according to the transverse; because the bone is near: and perhaps in it the phlebotome will be broken when it is thin.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins in the two lachrymals.
Moreover, the help of the two veins which are in the two lachrymals of the two eyes, is for the eye from scab and redness: and sebil in the eye, and sicknesses of the face.
And the manner of phlebotomizing them is, that the infirm person should bind his neck with a fillet.
Then phlebotomize them; and you be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across, to a little length, with a small, somewhat broad, phlebotome, for there is no flesh in the place.
For if the phlebotome is of a thin extremity, perhaps it will break.
Then make run out as much blood as is necessary for you.
And place a pledget on them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose.
Moreover, the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fever, and violent headache, and facial illnesses, such as hemicrania, and redness which occurs in the face, especially when it is longstanding.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person should constrict his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long phlebotomist; and insert it in the middle of his nose, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness.
Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the phlebotomist a little while; and you should let the blood flow according to your need.
Then bind it for one night.
For it is quickly restored.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the Guidegi.
Truly, the phlebotomy of the two Guidegi helps in the constriction of breathing, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad, corrosive ulcers, that is, gnawing herpetic sores.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that the sick person should bind himself under both [veins] in his neck with a ligature; and the surgeon should stand over the head of the sick person, and the sick person should sit on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist opens the vein to a length somewhat ample for the phlebotomy.
Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for it.
Then do similarly with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction, so that the sick person is not choked.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound heals.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins by Albucasis.
Moreover, the vein according to Albucasis is an aid to phlebotomy, because it contributes to canker in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those which are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that you make the sick person sit before you and bind his neck with a fillet.
Then roll back his lip and look at the two veins: of which one is on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of both.
And this is true: because around them are small, black veins.
Therefore incise each with a cutting incision. But if there is doubt for you, and you do not know which of them it is, then attend to the incision of the larger of them, and the more manifest of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed custom runs most with that: and incise the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
Indeed, the help of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for obstructions which are in the throat, and illness of the uvula, and illnesses of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the infirm person sits between your hands before the sun; and lift his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein: and the color of each inclines toward blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize both; and be careful lest you thrust your hand too far in phlebotomizing them.
For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries will occur.
Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Now the three veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow are those in whose phlebotomy custom runs in all men.
And the phlebotomy of them is done according to two methods.
Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or an olive-shaped one to a sloping thinness: or by cutting with a knife-like phlebotome, and this is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is that which is suitable for section.
And of them there are broad and thin types according to the size of the veins and their narrowness. The form of the myrtle phlebotome is broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of lesser breadth, and more slender at the ends.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellow blood.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the basilica.
Now the basilica, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the belly: and it befits the phlebotomist, when he phlebotomizes it, that he be cautious, and be above fear from it, for under it is an artery.
If therefore he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will happen.
Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a pointed phlebotomy instrument; indeed, let it be cut with an alnāsīl.
But if the basilica does not appear in manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you abandon it, and change to another, or seek some branch of it: or phlebotomize in its place the cord of the arm.
For it itself is manifest, and cut it with an alnāsīl phlebotomy instrument, as we said.
But if you wish the phlebotomy of it itself, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Then mark the place with cautery, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with an alnāsīl phlebotomy instrument, as we said.
And beware lest the incision fall through the space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with cautery, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
But if you see the blood in the phlebotomy leap up, like the urine of a boy, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Then therefore hasten, and place your finger upon it for a long space, then remove your finger.
If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then bind the arm, and release it: and let the patient beware of its movement: and let him be over his fear.
And let him not move it for several days, until it is healed.
But if the blood is not cut off, and it overcomes you: and you do not have medicine present at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of a fist, and split it: take one half, and bind it over the place of the vein constriction decently, with a bandage and powders until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
And if not: then treat it with that whose mention preceded from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in most dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the brown vein.
Moreover, the help of phlebotomy of the brown vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower part of the body: therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica, and a branch of the Cephalic, as we said.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that he be watchful concerning its phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
If therefore he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, there happens in it numbness, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
And this nerve oftentimes appears to the sense.
But if it is hidden in some men, and is subtle, and is not shown: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy by which you phlebotomize, an incision with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
But if the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the Cephalic vein.
Moreover, phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to diseases of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-shaped phlebotome, or with a myrtle-shaped phlebotome: because it is safer than all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor nerve. However, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy, that you avoid with the phlebotome only the head of the biceps, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first puncture, that it be repeated on it with phlebotomy several times. However, perhaps it will form an abscess in some men when it is not phlebotomized in the first puncture, but that abscess does not harm it in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Moreover, the quality of phlebotomy, and its consequences, in whose rectification it is necessary for you to think.
First, therefore, of that it is necessary for you to know, that phlebotomy is not administered, except in the preservation of health, and its perseverance, and caution from the coming of illnesses.
And so that phlebotomy may be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Median, and the Basilic.
And that phlebotomy be done at the beginning of Spring upon fasting, in spring and summer: and in autumn and winter after a meal, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.
But phlebotomy which is administered in illnesses does not have a determined hour: but when suitability and necessity prompt to it, in night, or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And it is not fitting that boys be bled until fourteen years have come upon them.
Nor let a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Nor let old men be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore when anyone wishes to be bled for whatever reason: it is necessary that he cleanse his intestines before phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if much retained fecal matter is in them: so that the veins do not attract putrid superfluities from the intestines during phlebotomy, harmful to the principal members.
Nor let a patient suffering from nausea, that is, sickness, be bled; nor one who is full from a surfeit, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Nor one ill with dropsy.
And let phlebotomy be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual intercourse, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything that weakens the bodily or animal strength.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors before it, if the blood is thick with food and drink and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him: or let him exercise in some way, so that the blood may be thinned.
And place his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we said: and strive that his chest be evacuated that day from all bad animal accidents: such as anguish, anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, excessive intercourse, and the like.
And let there be present in his seat things with whose use the custom of men runs, from aroma and fragrance and dancing and similar things, in as much quantity as possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion which is higher than the cushion of the one to be phlebotomized: afterwards let him draw out his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Then let him bind the ligament with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the binding be moderate, because when the binding is unequal, or excessive in binding, then it prevents the flow of blood: or if it is too loose, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Then after the binding it is necessary that the one to be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins swell and are revealed to the senses.
Then let the phlebotomist wipe the one to be phlebotomized with a little old oil, specifically.
Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself below the place where he wishes to phlebotomize, a little: so that the vein does not slip away, and the incision is spoiled.
Because among the veins there is one that you find like a fleeing cord during phlebotomy: and among them there is one that is full of wind: and when you place the phlebotomy instrument on it, it contracts under the instrument, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is narrow; therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm, and be careful in all these things.
Then let him put down the phlebotomy instrument.
And if not, then repeat it another time a little below that place, or above it quickly, if the place is not abscessed.
But if it is abscessed, or the patient is frightened, then leave him for a day or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess.
Nor should he enter a bath.
Then let him repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly, and you fear that the quantity of blood you desire will not flow out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same opening, in a straight line, and add a little to the operation.
And do this quickly, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is in many men a small operation.
Therefore if you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat it at all, for nothing excuses you then. And place something of the dregs of oil upon it; for it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomy, which phlebotomizes veins against the prohibition of blood flow: and theriac alfarach and sagzenea do this when one of them is placed upon the place.
For the blood is thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
But if a large abscess happens at the place of phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except at that time, or the opening of the vein is small, then hasten and place upon the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little: and bind it for one hour: for it is dissolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, with the completion of it, or from another vein.
And very often indeed abscesses and swellings happen near the phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
Place therefore your hand upon it, then if you find softness at your compression upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Beware therefore, that you place upon it something of that which we have said.
For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with that in which there is stypticity, so that the place may be hardened.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man from the blood according to the quantity of his strength.
And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it reddens: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it out until it is thinned: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein phlebotomy be widened, and the phlebotomist be broad: and in him who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that he extract it in times, and that the opening be narrow: and it is better that which is administered in vein phlebotomy is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the incision of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by breadth and length.
And to whom syncope is accustomed to come upon in phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or sugarcane, if it is warmed: and you extract from him of the blood in three times, or four.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in grape syrup, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in fragrant aromatized syrup.
But if syncope happens during phlebotomy, and the cause of it is the exit of much blood: then it is necessary that he take in drink meat water, and subtle fragrant syrup: and let him use aromatics with aloe, and let his chest be anointed with it: and let him use the other things which we said in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
But he who wishes to evacuate his arm, and to release his blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he release blood gradually according to the quantity of strength in continuous days.
But he who wishes to evacuate his arm, and release his blood a second time, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours, or nine, from his first phlebotomy.
But he who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite of the part to which it inclines: it is necessary that he be evacuated on the second day, or on the third.
But in whose body there is much blood already heated, and sharpened, and causes fever to happen: it is necessary that blood go out from it at once, and a large quantity be drawn out from it: and the opening be enlarged until syncope happens: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you put your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not happen in place of syncope.
For often that happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence falls.
And it is not necessary when you wish to open the arm, and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that it be pressed upon with vehemence, and bent and extended quickly.
For that is very bad, indeed leave it until it is phlebotomized a second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of a phlebotomy instrument that which is congealed from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it something of salt dissolved in water.
And place upon it something of theriac alfaroch, or sagapenum, and apply it with gentle compression, until the blood flows out.
But if the vein is already inflamed, then leave it, and do not cover it, until the inflammation subsides.
But if necessity demands the letting of blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another vein in the other arm.
Moreover, the cord of the arm is phlebotomized in the place of the median basilic and median cephalic veins, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should put his hand into warm water until it readily reddens, and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be bound above it with a ligature with moderate constriction.
Then phlebotomize it transversely little by little, not laterally, nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize it a little above the joint of the hand.
And indeed, the flow of blood is mostly put into warm water in the time of winter.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy, however, of the Salvatella of the right hand, benefits liver diseases.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that you constrict the Salvatella of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you have put it into warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly demonstrated.
Then phlebotomize it transversely.
And if you incise it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
And be careful not to overextend your hand with the phlebotome.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers denuded of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
Therefore, when you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not close quickly.
And similarly it is necessary that you do with every constricted branch.
Truly, the aid of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it contributes to the illnesses of the spleen; and similarly do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
Moreover, the aid of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for illnesses which are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menstrual blood, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person should put his foot into warm water: and make friction upon it, until the veins swell; and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap.
And indeed the place of the vein is near the heel, appearing towards the thumb: and many branches ramify from it in the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its confluence: because it is better and safer.
But if you phlebotomize it in the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy, by which you phlebotomize it, transversely, as if you wished to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skillful.
But if the exit of blood is prevented, then immerse his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into it, until it is evacuated.
But if the phlebotomist misses the vein at the first attempt, then repeat with the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you avoid the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel on the outer side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for pain in the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the patient should enter the bath and hurry: and bind his leg from the side of the hip up above the heel with four fingers breadth, with a long thin band; for it does not appear except because of that.
When therefore it appears, then phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you, or according to its direction: and it is better, either to incise it with an incision, or to cut it with a section.
For its location is safer, and it is in most men very hidden.
But if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the sense at all: then phlebotomize some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the dorsum of the foot, and towards the little toe: and beware of the nerves, and let flow from the blood the quantity which you wish.
Then loosen the constriction, and place over the place of phlebotomy a piece of leather, and bind the place.
For it heals quickly.
Concerning cupping, and the quality of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cups are made from horns, and from brass, and from glass.
And cupping is done in two ways.
With scarification and extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Or it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And there are fourteen places on the body for cuppings which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood.
Of which one is, the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck on both sides together: and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and the cuppings of Alachosos above the end of the spine: and the cuppings of the two elbows, and they are the middle of the two arms: and the cuppings of the two thighs: and the cuppings of the two calves.
And cupping indeed does not extract blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that strength does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Nor is it necessary that cupping be administered either with fire or without fire in any illnesses which arise from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity prompts cupping because of illness, or because of habit, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Which is because there are men in whom blood is multiplied until it needs extraction by cupping, and they find heaviness and headache in their head.
And there are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And there are those who find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And there are those who scratch the place of their cupping. And there are those whose laughter is increased.
And there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth; or the tongue is ulcerated, and they spit blood.
And there are those whose sleep is increased.
And there are those who see in their sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to those. Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order that venesection be performed, after two or three hours of the day have passed. Moreover, the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that it contributes to heaviness in the head and what is poured out into the eyes.
