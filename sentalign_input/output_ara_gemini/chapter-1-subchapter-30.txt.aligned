And the other aspect is in the elbow, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the elbow of the sick person ends, the elbow, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the left elbow of the sick person ends, and your lifting of the skin should be across the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body, then you insert the two skewers, very protected, until they penetrate the skin from the other side, then you remove the cautery iron, so the cauterizations are four.	The second method is to heat the cautery provided with two prongs, described in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder. Lift up the skin over the spleen at the level of the patient's left elbow; and let the fold of skin lie across the patient's body so that the cauterizations will fall longitudinally. Then push in the two prongs, well heated, till you have pierced the skin from side to side. Then take out the cautery; and there are four cauterizations.	0.78473
And if you wish to cauterize with the other cautery iron, which has three skewers, then treat the cauterized area after you leave it to drain pus for many days, then it is more effective than all of what preceded from the treatment.	Or if you prefer you can burn with the other cautery, of three prongs. Then dress the site of cauterization after you have allowed pus to run therefrom for many days. This is more effective than any of the preceding treatments.	0.80213404
