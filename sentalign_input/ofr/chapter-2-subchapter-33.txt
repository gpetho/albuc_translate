when the teeth become loose
When the front teeth become loose, either by a blow or by falling, and the patient cannot press on what he eats without them falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and that is of no use; then they must be secured with a gold thread, because silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes; and let the thread be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth; and if you want to straighten the teeth, take the thread and put it doubled between the two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you come carefully down to the healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the wrapping up to the part where you started, and tighten your hand subtly and carefully, so that it does not move at all; and let your knot be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and fold them back between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue; and then leave it tightened as long as it can stay, and if it comes loose, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread; it will remain and serve thus for all its time, and this is the shape of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of the two healthy teeth, and of the two loose ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, it is put back in its place, immediately, as we have said; and let no one interfere who is not wise and experienced, and sometimes a tooth is made from cow bone, and it is put in the place where the defect is, and it is secured as we have said, and remains and serves thus for a long time.
