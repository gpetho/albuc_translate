O you, my very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine along with its completion, and have made the end through its expositions and its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say "surgery".
And because the work of hands is neglected in our region and is altogether restricted, so the science is lost and diminished, and nothing remains of it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients that hands have copied. And from this has come error and vanity, and understanding is obscured, and knowledge is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it along with the organization of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will include along with it the forms of cautery irons, and other instruments of the work with the addition of the explanation and preparation of them, as is necessary.
And because no good master of hands is found in our time, the art of medicine is diminished. And whoever undertakes it must excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen said, so much that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and arms and their number, and the course of the moving and resting veins, and the location of their origin.
And therefore Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of the hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable about the aforementioned things, let him beware that he does not fall into error and kill people;
thus I have often seen several of those who undertake this science and so abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut an abscess of scrofula in the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; whereby so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who removed a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large; he also removed with it a piece of the bladder, and the man was dead within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew well that if he were cut, he would die from it.
And I saw another physician who took into his care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and along with the break there was a wound;
and the physician, full of ignorance, tightened the break over the wound with splints, binding it very tightly, and did not leave any opening for the wound to drain, and left him like that for a period of time;
and ordered him not to untie it at all;
and it remained like that until the leg was completely swollen, and the foot as well, and it was ruined.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come and untie the leg; and when I had untied it, it was at peace and he felt no pain.
But nevertheless the infection was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the infection did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was completely lost.
And I saw another physician who lanced a festering abscess, and then it inflamed due to the poor state of the patient's health.
For a canker, when it is full of melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron unless it is in such a place that all that is corrupted can be removed.
And therefore, dearest son, you need to know that manual work is divided into two parts: namely, work where there is danger in several ways;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore it is necessary that you protect yourself, so that foolish onlookers cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your tools wisely, and treat your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that by the grace of God you will succeed and be praised;
and leave the frightening diseases of severe nature;
and remove yourself from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you can go from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonishments: Do not undertake to treat a serious illness, lest you be called a foolish physician.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is about fire cauteries and sharp medicinal cauteries, and the chapter is organized from the head to the feet;
and about the shapes of the instruments, and the cautery irons, and everything that is necessary for the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and cupping glasses, and wounds, and extracting arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is organized with the shapes of the instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and it is organized from the head down to the feet, and the shapes of the instruments.
Before we recall the work, it is necessary that I describe the quality of help and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help, and of harm, are the longest discourse and subtle science and the hidden secret;
and many wise men spoke of this, and agreed on it;
and their words suffice little for me, for I fear lengthiness.
I say that cautery universally helps every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a complexion both hot and dry with matter, some debated and said that cautery is a great help there; and others said the opposite: that cautery is not good for an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be treated with heat, nor with dryness;
and he who said the opposite claimed that cautery is a great help for a hot and dry illness that occurs in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of a man and his moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have sometimes found it through experience.
And in any case, no one should interfere except those who have experience, and who know through long practice the chapter on cauteries, and the diversity of human complexions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the length of time;
We have no fear of other complexions, especially in cold and moist diseases. And all the physicians assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of healing, and of greater benefit than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not go beyond the limb that is cauterized, and does not harm other limbs except a little.
Burning medicines spread from limb to limb, and cause diseases in the limb that are difficult to heal; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its loftiness and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is excess.
And this I have found for you through experiment and the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and for this I apologize for the length of the speech, for I do not want to deprive you of the secret that is contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels diseases from bodies, as the philosopher says in demonstrating it; therefore receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on what time cauterizations should be done, and they chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable in all seasons, because the sudden harm is lessened by the help of the cautery; and especially if the cautery is for necessary, sudden, and urgent pains that cannot wait for the time when greater harm might come to the limb.
And do not ever think, dear son, as the foolish physicians do; for the illness that is healed by cautery does not return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not as they think, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is better than medicine because of the swiftness of its effect, and because of the power of its work and its mastery.
And it is possible that the illness sometimes returns according to the complexion of the patient and the location of the illness and its nature;
and the superfluities are gathered in him by the intake of foods and similar things, unless cautery is administered in a place where there are few superfluities and moisture, such as cautery of teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and it is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is effective after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer methods of treatment for any disease and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it is effective.
Then it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish physicians.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is gentler than with iron, and they only said this because of the quality of gold and the nobility of its substance;
and they said that the site of the cautery does not suppurate, but this is not true because I have tested it, and I have found that it is true in some people;
and gold cautery is better than iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot because of the color of the gold, and it cools down quickly;
and if it is heated too much; thus they make in the fire; and thus there is enough difficulty.
Now I have organized this chapter from head to toe so that the way is easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two that are made for a disease called "soda," and for many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for excessive dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all illnesses that come from coldness like paralysis and lethargy and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The method for this cautery is that the patient be purged by a laxative medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, depending on what the strength and age and constitution of the patient can tolerate; and then shave the patient's head.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his chest;
then place the base of your palm on the bridge of his nose between his two eyes; and there where your middle finger falls, bleed from the vein then heat the cautery which is called "olivare," of which this is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and do so while pressing down and tightening your hand little by little while twisting; then lift your hand quickly and look at the spot to see if you can see the bone just a little; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterwards take a little salt and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days;
afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter; and leave it on until the burn is gone; afterwards treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon", until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it is cleansed; and therefore it heals better/faster. (or "therefore, it promotes healing")
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery on until part of the bone is burned, and then one cuts away what is burned from the bone, and it is treated/healed.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on, and push so strongly that one lowers/scoops out the bone as wide as a whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors come out better/faster;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time; afterwards one should treat and solder/close it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some men where there is cause for fear;
and it seems better to me that I should leave it;
for the head (of the bone) is weakened by the continuous discharges of (bodily) fluids, as we observe in other limbs;
and also when the patient's head (of the bone) is naturally weak, and the first type of cautery is safer and better for me, and this one I use with the work together for healing.
When chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use irises and pills which are called "cochie," and purging of the head and oils and plasters; and if the cautery that we mentioned earlier is performed, and it is not effective. Take care if the patient's head (constitution) is of a strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize it a little below the cautery that we mentioned above. Afterwards, make a cautery on each temple of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "temples/vessels"; and it is a place where one puts cupping glasses; and lighten your hand so that you do not go down to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the temples be more subtle/smaller/shallower than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the method/form:
of the cautery of the head When in a part of the head comes a sudden pain, and the ailment extends to the eye, and the head is purged by cleansing medicines, and one has done the other treatments that I have described in the section on illnesses, and all this is of no use: then make cauteries in two ways, that is to say, with a sharp medicine and with iron.
The cautery with sharp medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and remove the skin and cut off a little at both ends, and then split the temple where the pain is located in such a way that you can place the clove of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, bind it and hold it firmly and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then unbind it and take out the clove of garlic, and leave the wound like that for two or three days; then put on cotton dipped in butter until pus comes out.
Afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is done in this manner. Heat the cautery, which has this shape:
And it is called "closed" because the head is shaped like a nail or has a slight curve, and in the middle has a small point;
and place it on the painful spot, and hold your hand steady and turn the iron slightly, so that half the thickness of the skin is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, is not burned, and a lot of blood flows out.
Afterwards, put cotton in salt water and place it on the spot for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want to cauterize this migraine with the cautery which is called "cultellare," use the very tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of illnesses, and it is not effective, and you see that the previously mentioned cauterizations with medicine and iron are not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery which is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and thus mark on the painful area a line half a finger long, and remove your hand immediately, and take care not to cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and beware of the mandible that moves when one chews, and be mindful of the nerve that moves it so that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of bleeding from the artery when it is cut, where cutting brings great fear, especially to him who does not know it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work halfway done;
but I will tell you how to stop the bleeding when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not enough for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of ear pain from cold
When ear pain comes from cold, and one has used dissolving medicines and other treatments that we have mentioned in the section, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which here is the form:
Afterward, prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the base of the ear after you have marked the place with ink; and make ten points around each ear;
afterward treat the area until it is healed.
of the torture of the mouth
Torture that must be treated by cautery is excluded except for those that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not cauterize similar conditions that come from dryness and nerve spasms.
When you treat this type of torture that arises from phlegm with hydragogues and purges of the head and gargles, and this is not effective, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery near the top of the ear, a little below the crown of the head, and another on the temple about a thumb's length long; and leave the cautery in place until half of the core is burned;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And it is similar to the lancet that we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle, and the blade should be a little thicker;
afterwards treat the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is long-standing and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: Two on the two temples of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the pit of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient strong herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
afterwards, shave the patient's entire head, and apply to the occiput the mustard plaster that is described in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the method of cautery: do it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, then make three cauteries down the middle of the head, descending to the neck, and let the space between each cautery be the width of a thumb;
and treat it like the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is tolerant, make a cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and treat him until he is healed;
and let the cautery be the one called "olivary," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of air and of what we have said before;
afterwards shave the patient's head, then cauterize him in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is strong, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the thickest part of the wound is burned, and lift your hand; afterwards treat it until it is healed, and let the cautery, which is called "olivary," be as we have said before.
Of epilepsy
The epileptic should not use cautery except for one who is phlegmatic, and it is necessary to first purify the brain with herbs and other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is old enough and able to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate it, have them gargle and chew things that purify the brain often, along with good foods;
afterwards shave the head in the middle, and make a cautery there according to what we have said before, and a cautery on the forehead, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and able to bear it, cauterize them as I have said for one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method I have described.
If the patient is a child, make a small cautery in this manner:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or humors are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize them with such cauteries as we have described for one who has paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluity is tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain may be cleansed, according to what is stated before in the division.
Afterward, shave the patient's head; then make a compress of well-made linen, like a circle, and place it in the middle of the head;
and let the patient sit cross-legged and be well supported on all sides;
then present the ointment, and aged sheep butter is good; and warm it moderately over a fire, so that the finger can tolerate it if placed within; then empty the circle in the middle of the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient once a week with other good management, until he is healed.
Or if you want to cauterize it by making multiple points with the cautery.
This method of cautery softens the brain evenly;
and then apply cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes, by the signs I have mentioned in the division, then begin by giving the patient a drink that cleanses the head, and protect him from all moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times while fasting.
Afterwards, tell him to shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on both temples if the flow of water is in both eyes together, or in one if the flow is in one eye;
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple;
and beware of excessive bleeding, and if you see too much blood coming out, stop it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and at the incision the precaution of how you will stop it;
and sometimes one makes a cautery or cauterization under the two bones behind.
and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I spoke of at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes: One cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or cauterizations under the two bones; and if there is need for more, then cauterize him carefully above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient three nights of cochies (a sort of medicinal drink) to drink; afterwards shave the head and apply a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery mark; and make two cauteries with the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, slightly below the hairline;
and beware of the artery so that you do not cut it.
And this is the shape of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery which is called "olivare." (olive-shaped) of which here is the shape:
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows, as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not remove the hand except when the third part of the eyelid is burned, in the manner that I have said.
of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the eyelashes are turned inwards, and prick the eye, and cauteries are made there in two ways: that is to say with fire, or with burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your lap; then draw on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs;
then place cotton moistened with egg white and psyllium mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery, which has this shape:
Then cauterize over the figure you have marked little by little, many times, so that the flesh is burned there;
and the sign of the success of the operation is that you see the eyelid retracted and the hairs raised at the corner of the eye;
then remove your hand, and leave it thus for three days, then put cotton soaked in butter there until the burn is healed; afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after this the hairs return and the eyelid is softened, then repeat the cautery over the same spot, as you did the first time;
and if the hairs are burned away, cauterize it until the eyelid is raised to its natural position and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take French soap and quicklime, an ounce of each, and grind them well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the shape you have made like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid; And if the patient has it in one eye only, you should work on one, and if in both, also; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the patient's head should be in your lap and put your index finger on the medicine, and press it a little and move it every time the patient feels a burning from the medicine, for it feels like a burning fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the burning has passed, lift up the moistened area and see if you notice the growth elevated as if it had been raised by the use of fire or by an incision; and if it is so, it is good.
If not, then apply more medicine to the area where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your mark is precise;
then apply cotton moistened with butter until the burned area falls off, afterward treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And you must take great care in your work, ensuring that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the paper softens afterward, and the hairs prick the eye, then reapply the medicine to the softened area of the paper neatly, just as you did before; afterward treat it until it is healed;
and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that people's eyes vary in size, and your restraints should be adjusted accordingly;
and the right way is not set forth for the one who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments are not effective, then you must apply cautery in this manner.
Instruct the patient to put their head in your lap; and let the assistant hold their head between their hands in such a way that they cannot move or shake their head;
then place cotton moistened in egg white or parsley juice over the eye;
then heat the cautery, which is like this:
and it is shaped at the tip like a feather of a vulture, together as one the cautery should be;
if you wish, it can be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it can be like a tent;
but still, this one that is pointed is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and draw out the matter;
then apply the cautery hot, and hold your hand to the cautery on the side of the nose above the eye, so that your hand doesn't cause harm; and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If you reach the bone at the beginning of the cauterization, that would be good. If not, repeat the cauterization again, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with the drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and then treat it according to what is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is a method of cauterization for fistula that some of the ancients described. Attend to the fistula, and cut open the area; afterwards place in the incision a thin tube, of which here is the form: and they make it about the size of a third of a lead weight; and hold your hand or the tube firmly, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run into his eye;
and it is necessary to put on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the site of the fistula, and heals it by marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good. If not, it is necessary to administer a perforation to the nerve, and bring back the fistula to the body of the nerve as appropriate in its proper place.
of cracks in the lips Very often cracks occur in the lips that are called "poil," and especially in the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have described in divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery in this way:
And quickly put it in those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards treat the area with cerate until it is healed.
When an abscess comes at the base of the throat or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, afterwards it causes rotting and pus and becomes chronic and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have described in divisions, and it is not effective: then you must have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand steady so that the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and to the furthest point;
and do this once or twice, then treat it with what we have described in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, that is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and it is of no use, then place the patient's head in your lap; afterwards, heat the cautery, the shape of which will come later, in such a way that you place a small chain on the tooth;
and place the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand there so that the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterwards, remove your hand and reapply the cautery as you wish;
afterwards, have the patient fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and then spit it out.
And in this way the tooth that was loose is strengthened, and the softened gums are tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
of the pain of the teeth
When toothache comes from cold, or there is cold or a worm, and medical treatments are ineffective, then cautery is necessary in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is as follows: you take cow's butter and melt it in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a tent, and soak it in boiling butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it there until it cools;
and do this often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a hot iron on it until the heat reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with combined fire is as follows: you take a tube of iron or bronze, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth;
then heat the cautery, the shape of which will come later, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand there until the cautery cools;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And the patient should fill his mouth with good butter immediately after this cautery, and then spit it out;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whichever end you want, and according to what you are able to do;
and this is the form of the tube:
of scrofula When scrofula is caused by phlegm and cold humors, and does not respond to digestion by medicines, then heat the pointed cautery, of which the form follows below, and it should have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is gone;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
When the humors prevail over the bronchial tubes of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be purged by laxative medicines;
afterwards make a cautery at the base of the throat, and be careful not to go down as far as the throat, and do not burn the heart but only a little.
Then make another cautery at the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let the cautery be what is called "clavile" of which we have the image before;
and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
When the cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the illness is chronic, make two cauteries on the chest in empty places; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cautery, which is called "clavile," be according to the form described previously.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking, with the cautery called "points," the form of which is described above in the section on ear diseases;
and let the pricks be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
Afterwards, treat the area as described previously, and let the cautery have three prongs according to this form:
And for this reason, the cauteries are easier because you make three at a time.
On the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, have the patient lie on his back and on his side; After, lift the core that is inside the areola with the fingers of your left hand;
And if the joint is dislocated inwards, then heat the cautery which has two nerves, of which here is the shape:
and cauterize the core until it pierces through to the rib, and the shape of the cautery would come to resemble four cauteries;
and for this reason, cauterization is done with the cautery that has three nerves, which is why the shapes of the cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are as thin as a probe and this is the shape of the cautery which has three nerves:
And sometimes another nerve is added to this, which makes eight cauteries.
Afterward, apply crushed leeks with salt onto the cautery; afterwards, let the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated from above, which rarely happens, then cauterize on the thick part of the clavicle cautery, with many cauterizations by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When coldness and much moisture enter the stomach, so much so that they alter its complexion, and catarrh increases in it, and the usual methods of treatment are used and they are not effective, then the patient must be laid on his back, and extend his legs and arms. After this, make three cauterizations: one below the hollow of the chest by the width of a finger, with the clavicle cautery, and two cauterizations outside on both sides, so that the shape of the cauterizations forms a triangle, and there is enough space between them so that they do not join together when they expel pus;
and let the cauterizations be so deep that they penetrate the two parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauterizations be according to this form without adjustment:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who is afraid of this cautery, should cauterize by pricking and mark a point on the stomach according to the amount of ink you want; then cauterize it with the cautery which is called "point.
After the treatment of the ailment that we have discussed before, until he is healed.
When pain comes to the liver from cold and moisture and from great flatulence, so much so that it is forced out of its natural complexion by the superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, so it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back; and mark three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity over the liver, below the hypochondria, there where the man's elbow reaches;
and have a space between each cautery the width of a finger; and let the cauteries be along the length of the body, and do not press your hand very hard with the whole cautery;
and only burn half of the core, and let the patient stand upright on his feet;
and if he cannot, then he should lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a knife, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and be careful not to burn the whole core, for you would dry out the whole body; and do not let it come to a boil, for the core is very delicate there, and know this for certain.
When there is an abscess on the liver, and you want to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels a pain, not too strong;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels a raging pain.
And then when this treatment requires the eyes, it is necessary that the patient be supported on his head;
and then mark with ink the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a spoke, of which here is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and goes down to the syphac, until all the pus is out;
after treat it according to the treatment for issues until it is healed;
and no one should use this cautery except someone who has studied long in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these diseases have passed sometime.
Then he can work boldly, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone.
Of the cautery of pleurisy
The ancients said that for pleurisy, cauteries should be made from the roots of birthwort, and in this manner: Take a long birthwort root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and be as thick and as long as your finger; and soak it in oil, and light it on fire, and cauterize one cautery between the armpit and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower down in the area that is below the chin;
and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, sloping downwards a little; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another over the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the chest outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it lightly as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use an iron cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess; and the pain jumps out, as we have said regarding the abscess of the liver.
But in this procedure, there is danger that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops that cannot be healed.
about the spleen
When you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have discussed in the sections on treatments, and it is not effective, then there are three types of cautery that are all good.
One of these methods is to make three or four cauteries, in a line along the length of the spleen, similar to the shape of the cautery for the liver that we discussed before;
and do not press your hand hard during the cauterization, and have the patient lie on his back;
And another method of cauterization is to heat the cautery that has two prongs, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the skin that is next to the spleen, where the patient's ribs are on the left side, and the elevation with which you lift the skin should be lengthwise along the body, and the cauteries should be across the width of the body.
Afterward, insert the two heated prongs until the skin is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four (marks).
And if you wish, cauterize with the three-pronged cautery.
Treat it afterward when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other treatments mentioned before.
Cautery is not useful for dropsy, except in the manner called "ascites".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the sections, and your treatment is not effective, then you must make four cauteries around the groin, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back on the spine, and one near the chest; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to drain pus for a long time, and do not abandon the care of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be together with God's help.
The form of the cautery for the belly should be the key (cautery iron) that we have shown before; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is placed above.
When the feet are swollen in someone who has dropsy, and are full of citrine-colored water, you must cauterize on the top of the foot between the little toe and the ring toe; and lift your hand with the cautery without twisting.
And do not go in too deeply, thus the citrine water will come out, and the cautery should be according to this shape:
Afterwards, make two cauteries on the legs, one on each leg at the tip of the calf muscle; and the cautery should be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without cleaning, so that the water comes out;
afterwards treat with the other treatments that we have mentioned.
When diarrhea comes from cold and moisture, so much so that the retentive and digestive power which is in the stomach and intestines is weakened, and cannot be treated by ways of treatments; and you see the patient suffering greatly and with strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been discussed previously regarding cautery of the stomach, with the circular cautery; and four cauteries around the navel, small, with a small key-shaped cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the spine, and a cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach next to the large one, for the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance/constitution.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the anus, one or more, and are old and consist of large cold and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have described in divisions/sections, and it is not effective, then make cauteries: Three on the spine, the one that is furthest outside, beneath the shoulder blade little by little in a triangular shape, and one cautery below the navel two fingers;
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and the food does not digest, and one sees swelling in the face, then make a large cautery on the stomach, as mentioned before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the key-shaped cautery; and leave the cautery open for a long time. After, treat the area until it is healed.
When you cut the keloid, heat a cautery that resembles a razor, and then place it, while still burning, on the cut keloid; and keep your hand there until the cautery reaches the base of the vein from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is a lot of keloid, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards treat them with beneficial ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the keloid, it will have a greater effect.
When the patient cannot bear cutting or opening, which we will discuss in its place, such an illness arises that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When someone develops a fistula, and it is aged and releases pus and corrupted fluids, you should probe it completely with a thin tent, and make sure you know with the tent how deep it is.
Afterward, heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to the depth that the tent has entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount needed;
and be careful not to burn the nerves that are there, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and to the intestine, beware of these places, and do not do this except in fleshy areas, and consider that it is not piercing;
Afterward, treat the area until it is healed, and if the place is sealed, and the infected matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed;
and if the infected matter is not removed, know that the place is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted; and as with one of those that we will describe in its place.
When kidney pain comes from cold, and from great flatulence, and there is no desire for a woman, then you must make cauteries on the kidneys on one side and the other with the key-shaped cautery that we have mentioned before;
and if we cauterize it in the middle, it will have three cauteries in a line, and they will do more good.
of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then make cauteries on the outside above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the joint of a thumb;
and make one cautery on the lower back outside, or two if you need to;
and let the cautery be key-shaped according to the aforementioned form.
When the spleen is cold and moist, and yet does not prevent conception, and the menses are corrupted and their periods delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary to make three cauteries around the navel, as we have described in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and the cautery should be key-shaped, as we have described.
When viscous humors descend to the hip socket, and for this reason it moves out of its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when they are measured together;
and the place of the separation is found empty, it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the hip socket with a cautery resembling a circle, and mark in front of the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is inside the circle;
and the cautery should be like the one used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and the cautery should be as deep as the skin;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain in the hip When pain comes in the socket of the hip, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated as we have described in the section and the treatment is ineffective, and the illness is chronic: then you must purge the patient of the thick humors with foul-smelling pills, or other similarly good pills. Afterwards, apply cautery;
and the method of cautery is as follows, in two ways: that is to say, with burning medicines together, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is done in many ways, one of which is this:
that you cauterize on the point of the hip, three triangular cauteries in this form, and make them good and deep and wide, and have between each cautery a space the width of a finger, and the cautery should be olive-shaped;
sometimes one makes a cautery in the middle, on the top of the hip, therefore there are four, in this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we mentioned before in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the thickness of the flesh is burned.
And this is the method used for sciatica, when the pain is located in the hip, and doesn't reach down to the thigh or the leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle, four fingers up, slightly to the left side;
and the cautery should be knife-shaped, and burn through the thickness of the flesh;
And if the patient feels the pain extending to the toes of the foot or nearly so, cauterize where they feel the pain, three or four points with the cautery called "point cautery". And if necessary, make more;
And if it is known that the pain is below the knee toward the thigh, make a cautery with the knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauteries not to leave the cautery in so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient further harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made cauteries on the ankle of the foot, and left them in so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot as well, and the entire foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bowel movement, from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make a cautery in one and the other, according to this method.
And the wise men said regarding the cautery of the hip, of which this is the method: make such an iron and let it be at the tip as thick as the fingernail of a thumb, or a little less, and let it be serrated and let it be from one serration to the other a distance the size of a thumb knuckle;
and let the serrations be angled on two sides, and let them be like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle;
and this is the shape:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws off sparks, and then place it on the buttock of the afflicted hip, and turn it onto the healthy side;
and cauterize it once with a round cautery and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; after treating it with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use this cautery little because of fear of its appearance, and we see few who use it;
and yet this is one of the good cauteries, for those who can bear it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is made with an instrument with openings into which the edge of the opening descends, and it should be of brass or iron with a long side, and at the top it should have two knots, and between each the width of a finger; and they should be open below and above, and joined together in this way:
Then place it on the buttock of the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand firmly on the buttock; then pour between the two rings hot water that has been heated on the fire for a while, and leave it for an hour, and let the patient endure the heat and the burning from it.
For it finds there a mortification as if by fire;
and when the mortification has passed, remove your hand with the instrument and wash the buttock with fresh water, and leave it thus for three days, and apply butter until what is blackened by the burn is removed; and leave it three days so that the pus comes out;
and this would be the final treatment after the application of ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or to the leg, make an instrument that holds water just as you did for the buttock;
and this is the method for hot water, and I have written it in the treatise on the correction of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, equal amounts of each, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole below so that the point of a razor can enter;
where there is a small hole below so that the point of a razor can enter; and place another well-sealed pot on top of this pot, and put alkali and lime and fresh water on top, until there is a finger's width above the powders when you have pressed it well with your hand;
and leave it like this until sharp water descends and falls into the sealed pot, then take all this water, and throw it onto lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very sharp and is administered in many medical procedures and in cauterizations of other limbs.
For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one can cauterize the hip well, such as orpiment and anacardic honey and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a treatment with which a man was cured of hip pain and sciatica, and praises it highly, and says that no other treatment was done, and that he was healed in a single instance when this treatment was performed, and he had bathed as he instructs below.
And says in this manner that you take fresh, dry green litharge, and grind it well with a little fat, and put it on the hip and on the thigh and on the leg where the pain is, and bind it;
and leave it for three hours, or as long as it takes until the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then have him enter the bath until his body is a little moistened, and have him go to bed, and the pain will go away completely and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines, unless it is after the body has been evacuated.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps a lot;
and the cautery should be done in this way. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow that is between the big toe and the next one, which is called foscile.
Then take dry goat dung and ignite it until it becomes coals, and put it on the wool, and leave it there until it is extinguished;
and do it again this way, and do not stop doing so until you think, by reason, that it reaches the hip, and that the pain has ceased;
and this type of cautery is called "goat cautery".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, either by falling or from a blow or by too great an evacuation, or from some sort of spread cold matter, for none of these cases is cautery useful, except for the one that comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary after the patient has been purged with foul-smelling pills or other such, that three lines marked with ink be made on his back, there where the pain is located, and on each line five cauteries or more according to the strength and the amount that the patient can bear;
and the cautery should be done according to the cautery which is called "points";
and if you wish, make three or four cauteries with the medium key cautery according to this form:
Often this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the onset is that they have shortness of breath when they rise, and fear; and you find on the last spinal process of the back and on us the appearance that comes upon the other spinal processes.
When you see this and you want to treat it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery affects each part of the spinal process equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spinal process with the pointed cautery two or three lines, and let the points be close to each other.
After, treat the area until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful not to apply cautery to a curvature that is in a nerve spasm.
of the pain of the joints
When joint pains are from humors that are spread to each limb of the body, and when the pain comes in the feet, which doctors properly call "gout," and when it is from a cold cause and treatments with medicines cannot cure it, it is treated by cauteries in this way:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary that you prick on the surface of the foot, make a cautery with the entire cautery that is called "point". And if the pains come up to the knees and to the other joints, and this happens many times, make three or four cauteries on each knee, on each side, with the olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there longer than it takes to burn the thickness of leather.
And if the pains descend to the knee and to the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make punctures around the wrist in two lines;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, make punctures on each joint and on the back of the hand;
And if the pains reach the elbows or up to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and ensure the patient has good care and takes medicines.
For if you provide good care and purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines descend into the scrotum, and this is recent, it is necessary that when you intend to treat it, he does not eat anything that day; and that he uses things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his belly;
afterwards have him sit on his back between your hands, and tell him to hold his breath until the intestines are returned, and put them back with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and also another incision shaped like half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
until it is white and throws off sparks. Then return the intestines to their place; and the assistant should hold his hand there so they don't return;
and open the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion under him and an attendant on his thighs, and another on his chest to hold his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you don't reach it the first time, do it again until you reach the bone; and carefully watch that the intestine does not protrude when you apply the cautery; so that you do not burn it; and that because of this the patient does not die, or suffer other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And the cautery for children must be small according to their size, and for adults as large according to their size;
After three days, treat the site of the cautery with butter until the burn is gone;
Afterward, treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound is well closed;
and their food should be cooked for a long time, so that their bowels do not move when they try to go to the toilet.
And after forty days, when they want to get up, apply a well-made support bandage, and wear it for another forty days;
and they should rest well, working little and avoiding overfilling themselves with drink and food, and avoid shouting too loudly;
and when they follow these instructions, they will be completely healed.
And I will discuss the treatment of cutting in its own chapter below.
When ruptures occur in other abdomens and are recognizable, and you see that they are not growing, then make a round cautery according to its size, and burn a third of the core; afterwards treat it according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery in this shape:
but first mark the location with ink and draw a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside it, and hold your hand in the middle with the cautery firmly in place.
But the first cautery is easier and gentler.
from old pain in any limb When pain arises in a limb, either from a fall or a blow, and this pain lasts a long time, and medical treatment is ineffective, then it must be cauterized with a cautery called "points," and the cautery should be applied according to the length of the limb and its size and weakness and its strength and its location with regard to twisting and its pain.
if he is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, repeat another cautery over that one, for such is the custom that it should move to the nearest limb, therefore you must perform the cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes greatly helped by cautery, and especially those illnesses that come from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it to be cauterized, take care if the illness is at the beginning, and if it is treated according to what we have said in the division, and neither descends nor remains, and you fear that the corruption will take hold of the whole patient, then make five cauteries on the head: One in the middle of the head to the occiput, and the other towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and press your hand so that the cautery reaches the bone, and so that the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize it on the spine according to what is described before.
And if the measles are spread everywhere; and it is clearly evident, then you must cauterize it with these cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the bridge of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another next to it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the breast, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the back heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the wrist bone, and another on the breastbone, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits him;
and know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery as the healthy feel it, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And the cauteries must be large and small according to the limbs and joints, depending on how you find it in the types of irons.
Afterward, treat the area with vetch flour with honey and other treatments until it is healthy.
When swelling occurs in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery go a little into the thick part of the flesh; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes one makes a cautery on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and yet no one should undertake this unless they are knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
When the illness called "albaras" is chronic, and medical remedies are of no use, then cauterize it with a shallow cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetches and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and lark blood, one part of each; and mix it all together, and bind it with a cloth, and leave it on the spot until it is healed.
The treatment of chancre by cautery
When a chancre appears at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the chancre.
And yet, wise men say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the chancre;
and yet, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have seen it happen sometimes;
and it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around, with the cautery which is called "circular," as we have said about cauteries.
When someone has an illness that is called "adubelati", and it is slow to mature/suppurate/come to a head either because of the excess matter it produces or because of the patient's age when he is decrepit (that is to say, too old) and he has little blood, or because of the weather/season; and you want to hasten its maturation/suppuration: then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by pricking/puncturing; afterwards leave it like that. For it will hasten to mature/suppurate/come to a head.
And if you want to pierce it completely with the cautery, then heat the cautery which has this shape:
And place your hand in the middle of this disease called “adubelati” until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it from the outside in such a way that the flow of pus is facilitated/released.
Afterwards treat it until it is completely healed.
There is another type of disease which is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it consumes the limbs as fire does dry wood.
If you see this disease in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat the cauteries, both small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place where the disease is;
afterwards cauterize it on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and none of it remains, so that everything that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply on the cauterized areas crushed sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are gone, and all the corruption.
Afterwards treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh is not growing, it is good;
and if not, then repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And this affliction was sometimes treated with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater benefit, and I have already described the treatment with sharp medicine in the section: take it when you have need of it.
of the pores/holes that come on the feet Very often it happens that on the outside of the feet a malady arises which is called "nail/corn/boil" according to our understanding, and it is a large, infected thing which hurts the foot.
And the cauterization of this malady is according to two methods. That is to say cauterization by fire, and cauterization by hot water.
Cauterization by fire is that you heat a cautery instrument like the quill of a vulture's feather, and it should be made of good iron in such a way that it can enclose the nail/corn/boil on all sides, and that it has thin edges;
afterwards put it, all hot, on the nail/corn/boil, and turn your hand all around the nail/corn/boil until it reaches the bottom of the nail/corn/boil; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus; then make a poultice of wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the nail/corn/boil will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with an ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.
And if they are turned outwards from the body, and often occur on the hands and feet, you must apply a hot water cautery; and it is in this manner: take a chain of brass or iron, or a vulture's feather, and put it on the nail/corn/boil and the wart, that is to say, warts and verrucas; and place the chain so that it surrounds everything, then put some hot water in it, and hold your hand firmly, and squeeze your hand while turning so that the edge of the chain reaches the root of the nail/corn/boil, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root;
and let the patient suffer the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like that, and it will uproot itself completely with all its roots.
Do this one after the other, until you have removed all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from nerve coldness, or quartan fever or other, you should make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery;
this will stop the trembling, and hasten the recovery from the cold illness.
Sometimes bumps, or stinking pustules, appear on the outer body, which come from large corrupted materials/humors.
So, first, when they appear, a cautery must be made on each head of the pustule: A subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose tip is set on fire, or of long birthwort root, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this way, and they cannot grow further from then on, but the superfluity from which they come is broken, and they are healed;
But this must be done after bloodletting.
Often there are large flows of blood from the artery that is cut in a wound that occurs superficially, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cauterization of a limb, and similar things; and it is very difficult to stop.
And nevertheless when this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press very hard until the blood is calmed under your finger, and no more drops come out;
then put several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire until they are all red-hot;
then take one, either large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you are holding your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another one of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not stop doing this one after the other until the blood is stanched;
and be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be easily stopped, especially when the artery is large, except by one of the four methods that we have described: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not cut, or by tight tying with thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stop blood; and it should be tied and tightly bound.
Whoever attempts to stop the bleeding by tightly binding cloths or by putting burning things on it, or other similar things, will achieve little benefit.
And if this happens to someone and they do not have a doctor or medicine present, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until the bleeding is stopped above the wound and above the vein; and do not remove the finger, but wet it often with cold water, very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and then do what is necessary with cauteries and medicines.
We told you in the first chapter every illness where cautery by fire, or burning medicine, is necessary, and the occasions and the causes and the instruments and the methods of cauterization;
and I have arranged this chapter from head to toe, and I will continue in this chapter in the same manner so that one can more easily find what one desires.
And before I begin this, dear son, you must understand that in this chapter there is more danger and fear than in the first one on cauteries, and therefore greater caution is required.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die.
And I warn you not to undertake folly. For many kinds of people come for treatment. Thus come some who are so angered by their illness that they die easily because of the fury they find in their sickness, and the greatness of its malice; and of these one must be wary.
And among these are some who give you their trust and say: Wait, I am healed"; and the illness is deceptive.
You should not agree with those who come to you with this attitude, but place more value on your honor than on your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely in what you are certain of, and from which you can gain reward and praise;
and use prognosis and indication in the treatment of your patients so that it leads to healing;
and this will help you to acquire a good reputation, and glory, and the memory of praise.
Very dear son, Our Lord give you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of his hand, amen.
Now I have arranged this chapter by dividing it into sections, according to what is before in the chapter on cauteries, which I described to you from head to toe, so that you may more easily find what you need.
Know that this illness often occurs in children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that is unknown.
And I have never seen this illness except in children, and in all those I have seen, death came quickly; and therefore it seems to me that it is better to abandon the work in such treatments.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew every day so much that he could not support it;
and the fluid grew so much that he died, and this fluid collected beneath the bone above the meninges, between the brain and the bone;
and the procedure is as follows if the fluid is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you make a wide incision in the middle of the head;
and it should be as long as two nuts, so that the fluid can flow;
and here is the shape of the spatula:
If the fluid has grown more, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions in the shape of a cross, like this:
And if the fluid is under the bone, and the signs that you see are the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it inside with your hand, and this is not resolved for you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head like this:
And after the incision, extract all the fluid out. Afterwards, bind the incisions with bandages and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it like this until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and keep the head evenly bandaged, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you observe or perceive the size of the abscess, and the collection of fluid;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore cut where the abscess appears, and the accumulation of fluid, and split it open as much as you can;
and be careful not to cut the artery; and if a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the loss of blood and the evacuation of fluid.
When someone experiences an illness called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is chronic, and medical treatment is not effective, then the last resort is cauterization, along with cutting the two arteries.
It is therefore necessary, when you are about to cut them, that the patient tilt their head back; afterwards rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then have the patient constrict their neck with a cloth; then observe where the vein pulsates, and the location of each is behind the ears, and a little recessed;
then mark the locations with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp scalpel in two places, so that the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the scalpel under the artery and cut it from above, cutting like two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery cannot be felt, then you must measure the distance of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut to the bone;
and the necessary amount of blood to let out is six hundred (600 ml), and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can tolerate, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if any of the periosteum remains on the bone, cut it so that no abscesses form there, then tighten the wound and bind it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When an old migraine comes, and acute catarrh, because of the moisture of tears and the heat in the temples and chronic raging headache and similar things, and he is treated with various medical cures and none of it helps him, we should open the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the way to open them is for the patient to pull back the hair from his temples, and pay attention to the artery that appears in the temple, because it is clearly visible by its pulsation, and is rarely hidden except in some men who are too cold;
and if it is hidden, the patient should tighten his neck with some cloth, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and sprinkle the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula which has this form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it up with the forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it on that side according to the size of the two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood will not spurt out completely.
And draw blood from six hundred up to three hundred;
and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no decay comes before the healing of the wound, and bleeding occurs;
then cut the excess between the two ties at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with the cutting cautery down to the bone until the heads are severed;
and that is the better way, if the patient has no fever and is of a warm complexion. For cautery helps to dry up moisture: therefore it is of greater help with moistures.
Or it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fills the place with old cotton and puts on well-made tents;
and when they are untied, they should be treated with drying medications that promote flesh growth, and with tents, until healed;
and if blood flows from the artery while you are working, hasten to stop it with cautery, or fill the place with vitriol and compress it with your hand until the bleeding is stopped; and if you don't have that available, put your finger on the spot until the blood clots, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the bleeding stops, and compress it as needed;
And there should be a finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places with ink, and you place the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be spaced apart between the two ends for it is not completely fused with this cautery from one end to the other;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and what is better and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cutting cautery from two sides, but the cutting edges should be quite thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes descend from the veins that are on the top of the head because of heat, and medical treatment is of no benefit, and you see the patient's face redden, and feel a throbbing in the forehead like a tremor; and under the eye is tender and moist, so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and chafed by the burning of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "cure by contusion", and it is that you shave the hair from the forehead of the patient who has this disease, then make three incisions in the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "cure by contusion", and it is that you shave the hair from the forehead of the patient who has this disease, then make three incisions in the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be about two fingers wide in the middle of the forehead, going down to the nose, and the other two on the sides above the eyelids, and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the connection of the two jawbones, and let each wound be the width of three fingers joined together across;
and have ready a piece of sponge and plenty of cloths to wipe the blood, then apply the sharp spatula on both sides of which this is the form:
from the incision which is towards the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two incisions, along with the pericranium which is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then remove this spatula. then put in the first incision the instrument which is called "cultellaire", which is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And put the cutting side toward the flesh close to the heart, and the smooth side towards the bone, and insert it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to that which opens to the heart, and then do the same in the middle incision up to the other outside [incision];
and then draw blood evenly, and compress the area because of the blood taken;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and watch that no hot abscesses develop;
and on the third day untie the bandage, and apply a large amount of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which one treats wounds, until it is healed.
When someone experiences acute, recurring catarrh, and you see their eyes dim and small, and their vision weakening, and their eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and there is a sharp pain deep in the head, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that these matters and this catarrh come from many veins, and the best treatment there is, is this one.
And it is that you instruct the patient to shave their forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another one the width of a thumb. And begin from the incision at the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move during eating;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate between the two edges of the incision and put in old cotton and linen tents; then tie over it cloths soaked in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying agents, which promote the growth of flesh.
In this manner: take two parts wheat flour, and four parts colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to generate flesh everywhere.
On the blocking of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grain, or an insect, or a mineral stone or similar thing such as iron; or a seed, such as vetch, beans, peas; or a flowing thing such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other type of thing falls into the ear that does not stick to the ear, nor grows in the ear, place the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then instill a little violet oil or sesame oil, then attempt extraction; and make him sneeze with condiments, and block his nostrils when the sneeze comes, and wrap pieces of cloth or wool around his ear; and stretch the ear upwards.
Often it will come out with this treatment;
and if it does not come out, attempt extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it jumps out with the forceps, that's good;
If not, then attempt extraction with a fine hook, slightly curved;
and if it doesn't jump out with that, then make a tube of bronze and push the end of the tube into the opening of the ear firmly, and plug what is around the tube with soft wax so that air cannot enter with the tube; then pull it out strongly, because it often comes out as we have said;
And if it doesn't come out in this manner, then take birdlime, which is used to catch birds, and put some on the tip of an instrument suitable for this purpose, and put a bit of cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out with all these things that we have said, then hurry to cut open the ear before a hot abscess and spasm develop;
And the way to make the incision is that you first have the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to their strength, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear in the fatty or adjacent area; and the incision should be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and quickly suck it out with your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, then administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin, subtle spatula according to this form: and administer an incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it;
then extract it with fine forceps and by suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is alleviated.
For water that falls into the ear, the patient must first use sneezing powders, and fill the ear with old cotton. And lie on the same ear where the water is. If it comes out because of this, that is good.
If not, take many stones the length of your little finger, thin and light, and heat them a little in the fire; and the patient puts one in the opening of his ear, and jumps up and down on one foot, and strikes the stone that is in the ear with another stone; and do not stop doing this from stone to stone until all the water comes out, and thus it will all come out;
and if you wish, take a rush, and put one end in the ear, and light the other end until most of the rush is burned;
then do the same with other rushes until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
In extracting the creature, if it is small-bodied, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the section;
but if it is large-bodied so that it can be felt, then administer extraction with forceps; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms generated in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the section on and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment is not effective, then you must examine the ear in the sunlight: if any worms appear, pull them out with fine forceps, and if they don't appear, take the cannula which has this shape:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the narrowest end into the ear according to the degree of the patient's discomfort, then suck strongly with the cannula; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they don't come out, then pack cotton around the cannula as I described for stones;
and if they don't jump out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have proven effective in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And it should be made of silver or brass, narrow below with a small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside, use a well-made brass instrument for this purpose, and if you wish, take a razor and carefully wrap cotton around the tip; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever medicine you want, into the cannula, and the cannula should be in the ear;
then insert the razor with the cotton, and press your hand gently until the oil is distilled into the cavity of the ear; and the patient should feel it inside, and the distillation should be slightly warmed by fire before it is distilled into the ear; and be careful that it is not too cold, because the medicine would not be as effective.
On the blockage of ears
Some children are born without any openings in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men by the blockage of a wound, or by flesh born inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear, so that it cannot be seen;
and sometimes it happens that the opening is almost closed, and one sees it well.
The one that occurs deep inside, so that one cannot see it, is difficult to heal in several situations, and in the one that can be seen, you must place the patient's ear in the sunlight; and look inside: if you see the blockage apparent, then open it with this spatula of which the form is here:
And it should be sharp and cutting at the front and back, entirely flat, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the blockage is from flesh born in or on the body of the ear, grasp it with fine forceps, and cut it lightly, until all that flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep within the ear, take a thin, light razor and warm it a little in the fire, then place it in the body of the ear.
If you feel the blockage which causes the patient difficulty hearing, pierce it lightly, and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear;
then place in the ear a tent according to the width of the opening, and soak it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and soak it in rose water, and powder it with crushed vitriol;
and if you see the ear swell, you must remove the tent and replace it with another tent soaked in cerate which is made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then treat it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, soak a sponge and cloths in cold water and place them on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the bleeding which are in the treatise on distillations.
These little growths that appear on the eyelids when they are moist and dry must be pulled out with forceps and tweezers, and the root cut with a small spatula; then apply ground vitriol to the area.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a fine lenticular cautery, and cauterizing after the incision is worth a lot;
and they often return, when some of their roots remain; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and they do not return.
of hail Often there appear in the eyelids things that resemble hail in their form and hardness, and for this reason this disease is called "hailstone", and it is a collection of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below; the procedure is as follows:
the procedure is as follows: observe if the hailstone moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to determine;
then make a wide incision, then peel it gently from each side, then grasp it with tweezers, and cut it out.
if you cannot cut it out without piercing the eyelid a little, it does not harm the patient;
and if the tear is large, join it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not exert any force, for the ointment will soon restore it and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone is descending inside the ear toward the upper part, invert the eyelid, and grasp the hailstone with tweezers, and cut it out and press from both sides;
and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does not matter;
and when the hailstone is removed, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with something that generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and it greatly bothers their eyes, and they have mucus in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes;
and because of this they constantly lie on their faces, and sleep on them, and their eyelids below their eyebrows are moist, which swelling and appearance are covered by the exinach that is visible in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the method of the procedure is that the patient puts their head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the amount of exinach contained on each side, then put it on them; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then split the moisture in the middle with a sharp spatula, making a cut the width of, and no larger than, the incision made for bloodletting;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several instances, exinach comes out of the cut, looking like a piece of white fat.
Then extract it all in one piece with a cloth grasped between your fingers over the fire, and turn your hand right and left until it is removed;
and be careful not to push into the cut, that you do not reach all the way to the eye with the spatula, lest you injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then enlarge the incision slightly until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then soak cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and apply it to break down the remaining moisture.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess develops at the site, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the eyelids When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural ones, and become irritating, they harm the eyes and cause various ailments such as habitual tears and softening of the eyelids and albugo, to the point of causing the destruction of the eyes;
and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is described above in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and stitching or by small tubes/pipes, as I will explain.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn back the eyelid with your left hand;
if it is inverted/turned outwards, it is good; if not, then insert a needle with a thread through it; and let this be near the edge of the eyelid where the eyelashes grow, near these hairs, and pull the thread up along with the eyelid, and turn it towards the surgeon/barber;
then cut in the part below the eyelid, beneath the eyelashes, with the spatula-shaped knife, from the large tear duct to the small one;
then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small tent of cotton and cloth, then draw on the eyelid a figure with ink, like a myrtle leaf, and however, it must be that the figure is according to the amount that you want to raise the eyelid which is separated from the others.
And there are some who need a large amount of the eyelid cut, depending on how softened the eyelid is;
then cut with the spatula-shaped knife along the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the cuts be near the natural eyelashes about the thickness of a hair, then place the hook in one of the two angles of the heart shape, then peel it all off;
then join the two edges with a suture using a needle and a thin woolen thread, and wipe the blood, and burn the excess threads above the eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so;
and if not, don't worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitching, with drying and constricting substances, for the eyelid lifts itself up when the wound closes and joins together, but stitching is better (as the ancients said), and this is a painless procedure; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and that is you mark the eyelid with a figure shaped like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three points separated according to the shape shown here:
then cut what is protruding with small, even cuts according to the shape shown here:
And if you are unable to hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread in it, and place it in the middle of the figure; and place another thread next to the large tear duct, and the second thread next to the small one, and gather the threads evenly between your fingers;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have made the mark, as we have described, then bring together the two edges of the wound by stitching, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess develops at your incision, soothe it with a plaster and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelid are turned inwards:
so you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more specialized.
The treatment of dog bites is as follows: and it is that you turn the eyelid and slit it inside as I have said, and then make two incisions skillfully, and two fine threads as long as the eyelid and the width of the spatula; and cut at the two ends on the two sides where you hold the threads;
then join one and the other delicately over what protrudes from the eyelid, and tighten the two incisions of the two parts firmly; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin that was constricted will die and blacken and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with scissors, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, the eyelid will be lifted, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two incisions that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
The procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread a soft and fine silk thread through it; then bring the ends together and knot them both subtly, and the length of the threads should be one palm long;
then arrange in the instrument another short, fine silk thread, and knot the ends of the thread;
then have the patient put their head in your lap;
and be near the sun so that the work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate task, then insert the needle with the instrument at the root of the hair next to it, and pierce it through the caruncle quickly until you pull it out over the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the instrument, and insert that hair into the instrument, whether there is one or two or three or more;
then pull your hand so that the hair comes out with the instrument in the caruncle along with the natural hair.
And if the instrument is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, then you will pull the instrument from below with the thread that you have arranged there, until the instrument comes out of the hole above and you see it with the vision of your eye;
then you will pull the instrument and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair is burned in its place and the flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is short, add a long natural hair, and lift it with the one where you leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
of the rotting of the eye When this disease, which is called "alacratia" or rotting, affects the eye, there are two types:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it occurs from a sudden wound, or a cut, or a cautery, and similar things.
And the method of treatment is that you cut open that seam/suture, and separate its lips/edges, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and you must not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict. For if you do this, the illness will return worse than the first time;
but treat it with softening things, such as fenugreek; and bathe it with water in which marshmallow and linseed have been boiled, and ointments of melted diachylon in some oil, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with this.
And the key to your treatment is to be careful that it does not heal in the same shape as it was before;
and this work that we have described is nothing other than the correction of this illness, so that it does not return in the form it was before.
This disease, which is below, is truly called "axacrati", and is both natural and accidental.
The accidental type comes from wounds and cracks and cauterization and similar things;
and the way to operate on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and stick it in the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out at both ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it with a spatula one finger wide. And if the form of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good;
if not, then take a razor and put it in the crack, and turn the eyelid, and make two incisions on the side inside the eyelid;
and let the ends of the two incisions be at the two angles of the incision that you cut, and make an angle so that when they are assembled, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "Greek I"; (or "Y")
then remove that flesh, according to how much its sides are sharp underneath, from what is attached to the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a woolen thread;
then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines, and with tents, until it is healed.
And if the illness comes from a crack or a seam or a cautery, then you must make a full incision under the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what is described above; then separate between the two edges with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two edges with a tent, as I have said; and the work must be done according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master devises with all his power how he can return the appearance to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what is required in terms of work and instruments in various arrangements.
When this adhesion happens to some men in such a way that the upper eyelid is attached to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must insert the point of a razor under the eyelid, and lift it upwards;
and stretch it with small tweezers, until you cut what is stuck with a subtle spatula, which should not be too sharp or too cutting, so that the patient can tolerate it and the too sharp spatula does not injure the eye;
and make your incision, with which you peel away this adhesion, lightly, so that the eyelid returns to its natural shape;
and this entire adhesion is healed, and they sometimes put salt water in the eye, and then rinse it with fresh water, and with an eyewash;
then place between the eyelid and the eye a linen tent, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after the third day, use the eyewash and desiccating remedies until it is healed.
Know that the nail (pterygium) is of two kinds: one is fibrous and resembles a hard tumor, and the other is not fibrous, but resembles a frozen white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and tries to grasp it with forceps, one cannot;
and both kinds begin near the tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover all the sight and all the light and the movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head on your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail with the forceps, bending it slightly, and stretching it upwards; then take a needle, and put in it a horsehair, or a cow hair, or an ox hair, and a strong thread; and bend the point of the needle a little and insert it in the middle of the nail, and pierce it through with the whole needle, and tie the nail with a thread and stretch it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil and the white of the eye up to the top, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a very fine spatumile and with little force, and leave the natural flesh in the tear duct, so that the flow of tears does not become accustomed to the incision;
and sometimes the nail is stretched with the hook only, and with the thread, as we have said; then it is scraped with the spatumile gently, which has this shape:
And be careful that the spatumile does not touch the fleshy tissue and tear it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision put a little crushed salt in the eye, and some collyrium made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert the needle, and the hook cannot enter, often this type of nail is treated with medicines;
and they grow as I have explained in the section, and if you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take a smooth spatumile, slightly sharp, in this shape: And scrape the nail above subtly, and if you see that it diminishes somewhat and the root comes close, then instill in the eye a collyrium made of litharge and red collyrium and crushed salt from your mouth, and cover the eye until the next day;
If something is wrong with the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and treat the hot abscess first until it is healed, then recommence the work as before, until it is healed.
then recommence the other work according to this same method, until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the caruncle harms the eye greatly, then lift it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all, so that a flow of tears doesn't come;
then instill in the eye red collyrium which is made of litharge.
In the eyes of some men sometimes grows red flesh, and it covers the pupil and presses on the eyelids and turns them outwards, and resembles a pomegranate blossom;
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then you open his eyes, and lift all this flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly;
then cut the first layer of flesh, and continue cutting with the scalpel to the end, and be careful not to injure the eye during the procedure;
and make the incision with the spatula that we mentioned in the incision of the nail and with the small forceps with which the sebum is removed, as the figure after this chapter shows;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt or instill red bile and similar corrosive medicines, and put on the external eye cotton with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and hot blood overcomes you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus you make flesh grow back in the eye by this method.
But nevertheless, you must lighten the treatment of each weak eye in a natural way; and in the case of an accident, by working with iron; (This likely refers to surgical instruments)
and do not put your hand to any of these works until you see that this member is able to tolerate that work.
Sebel are red veins that cover the eye, and impair vision and weaken the eye constantly.
It is therefore necessary first that you see if the eye, in which the sebel is, is strong, and there is no other disease besides the sebel; then treat it in this manner:
tell the patient to put their head in your lap, then lift these veins with the hook according to your knowledge, and let the hook be subtly double according to this form:
And let there be two hooks by degrees in one body according to this form:
then when you pull on those veins subtly, and draw out the blood a little at a time, until you see those veins removed from the eye;
and be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at noon in front of the sun, and be very careful in your work so that you only cut those veins;
and when you have done this, then instill in the eye green and red collyrium to dissolve what remains of the sebel.
And if you are unable to remove all of it at that time, apply a plaster over the eye made of things that soothe eye pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and a warm abscess is ensured, then start again according to the method described above until it is healed;
and this is the form of the hooks:
Physicians call a fistula "arissati":
When you treat it with cautery and with a sharp, burning medicine as I have said before, and it is not healed, the method is to cut open the abscess where it should remain, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it with the instrument, of which this is the form;
and it is called a "rough head," and it should be made of Indian steel with a round head, and pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the site of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your two fingers, and press your hand a little so that you know that the corruption is scraped;
and do this a few times, then restore the area with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the boil is healed, and remains so for 40 days, and it does not reopen and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
If not, there is no other solution than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nerve according to this method: and that is to uncover the bone a second time with an instrument, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, take a drill according to this form, and let the head of iron be three-angled, and the shaft be thinned down to the tip as you see here:
then place it on the bone next to the tear duct, and move your hand a little away from the eye, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the air comes out if he holds his hand over his nerve/nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nerve/nose; thus it is easier for the patient.
When the eye is completely open, and there is no disturbance or lessening to the nose/nerve, then you must tie the patient;
then bleed him, then apply cupping glasses or a tube without lancing to suck, then put on the eye a plaster made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and then constrict the eye, and the plaster over it with bandages and cloths;
and the method with the cloths is that you take fairly soft cloths, and fold each one in four, and then place one on top of the other according to the quantity the eye needs;
then tighten over it with a very hard bandage, and repeat the cupping glasses to suck without lancing;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye constricted day and night, and if the plaster softens, then you must tighten it a lot;
then remove the plaster after a day and a night, and if you see the eye improving, that's good;
if not; then repeat the plaster and the cloths and the bandage and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
of the breaking of the uvea When a disruption occurs in the uvea, then it opens, and matter comes out of the eyelids like a grain of resin, and it is frightening to see;
then if you see fit to cut it, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the part underneath, up to the one above, then insert another needle with a double thread from the corner of the eye; and pierce it there, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie one part of the uvea around it, and tighten it well, then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye;
and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is held together by the uvea, all around, with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye swells considerably, pierce it at the thin spot that comes from deep within the eye, and drain the albuginous moisture so the eye goes down, and enter it immediately;
then remove it once it is healed.
This disease which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling that has gathered in the eye, resembling dripping water, and yet it is not water;
and the way to perform the procedure is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight chair, then take their head in your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the swelling rise up towards your eyes; then it should be inserted, so that it does not descend, and the light is unobstructed, and the patient can see things as they used to;
and if it does not descend, know that it is water, and the appearance of the swelling is not as we have described.
have the patient sit between your hands, then take a fine spatula and make a small hole in the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the iris, so that the swelling comes out;
and when it has come out, instill warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled with honey, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of the waters of the eye We have already described the appearances of the waters in the section, and what is necessary for piercing; So act according to the health/condition.
You must have the patient sit between your legs crossed, away from the sunlight, and bind the healthy eye and tighten it very firmly;
then place the eye chart in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the tip of the instrument next to the pupil about the thickness of a spoke in the white of the eye towards the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" forcefully, and twist your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and the depth of the almagda's path must be equal to the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris; and that is the pupil of the eye;
you will see the bone in that spot because of the clarity of the cornea, and then place the instrument up to where the fluid is, then press it out from one path to another.
if the fluid descends immediately, the patient will see in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Afterwards rest a little, and if the fluid rises again the second time, place the cautery with the instrument, and when it is inserted and it does not rise, then remove the almagda gently by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little bit of rock salt in water, and bathe the eye in this. Then cover the eye completely with tow or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bandage it with the healthy eye.
We, and those who are of our time, apply ground cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which this is the form:
And then pierce the conjunctiva only, and do not go too deep, but make a small hole, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable dormitory, where he may sleep on his back in a dark place;
and let him be free from all movements, and take light meals, and not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and be bandaged according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark house, and test his sight, and make him see some things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day;
and you should not do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must delay this, because the humor rises quickly.
If hot abscesses arise, untie the eye before the seventh day and treat it with that which soothes abscesses;
and when it is calmed, then uncover the sight and place a pad on his face to cover it for a few days, and he should still be in that dark house.
And then he should leave the house little by little, and return to his affairs;
and know that no apprentice should interfere in this case. And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made perforated almond paste through which they sucked water, but nevertheless I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almond paste, so that those who don't know them can see them;
and they should be made of brass specifically: And let their tips be of this same fineness, and the last part in three sharp angles.
Sometimes there arise in the nose diverse fleshy growths, some of which resemble scorpions with many legs;
and there are some where there is flesh ingrained with a pale color, and there is soft flesh of good color. In the case of the flesh that is soft, and not ingrained, you must have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
In the case of the flesh that is soft, and not ingrained, you must have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and cast the hook at those fleshy growths, and draw them out; then cut what you can hold with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the flesh is entirely removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, then open it with one of the subtle instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if blood overcomes you, or a hot abscess, then treat it as appropriate;
and if it is a malignant abscess, hurry and cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then put in clean vinegar and water or wine. If the nose opens, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that he is healed;
and if moisture does not flow as it should, know that there is dead flesh on the bone above, which the instrument cannot reach to cut:
then you must put in a rather thick linen thread, knotted by hand, with about a finger's width or less between each knot; and have the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as far as he can, and pull it while smelling until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and children in schools often do this, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other, tugging on the knots that are in the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have broken down that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all the remaining flesh;
and then put a lead tube in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if drying medications are needed, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And let it be of silver or brass, similar to an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and it should have a handle at the end to hold it when heating the oil or some liquid.
of the flesh on the nose
Often a disease arises at the tip of the nose which is called "telul," and grows and becomes increasingly large, until it is a hideous thing to look at;
and therefore you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it all away, then put on the spot the cautery or the burning medicine;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of a dark color, of little feeling:
do not touch it with iron for it is a cancerous abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not of a dark color, and you see that it can be completely cut out, then bleed the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the area with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a break occurs in one of these cartilaginous structures, it heals poorly, except in some people.
It is therefore necessary when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, then you must scrape all the parts of their core until they bleed, then bring the two lips together with a suture, and tighten it, and sprinkle on powder of dragon's blood, and ground incense; and put over the powders a piece of strong plaster or other binding plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suturing is that you bring together the separated parts: either with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the abdomen; or with thread, as I have explained to you.
of abscesses of the lips
In many men, hard abscesses appear inside the lips, resembling vetch grains, both smaller and larger;
then you must turn the lips, and cut into each lump, and grasp it with pincers and cut it on each side;
then fill the place after the incision with crushed vitriol, until the bleeding is stopped;
and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with dry things until it is healed.
Many times, extra flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus";
so you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow;
then put on the area crushed vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders;
and if this flesh returns after the incision, and it often does, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: thus it will not return after cauterization;
Sometimes there are gathered at the top of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scabs that are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and green, so much so that the decay reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
so you must have the patient sit between your hands, and his head be in your lap, and scrape the teeth where the scabs appear, until nothing remains there; and do the same with the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other stains, until they are cleaned;
and if what is there is removed on the first scraping, that is good; if not, then begin scraping again the second day and the third, until you have scraped everything away;
and know that the teeth require various shapes of instruments for scraping, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers with which one scrapes outside the teeth have other shapes than those with which one scrapes between the teeth; and these shapes and others should be prepared with you.
It is advisable, when you treat a toothache, that you delay extracting it as long as you can, because one should not do this; because it is a very important substance unless one has no other option than to extract it.
Then, when the patient is compelled to have it extracted, you must be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they think it is in a healthy tooth, and have the good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not go away because of this, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this done to these healers;
and when you are quite certain of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then loosen it with your fingers or with fine tongs at the first push and push, until it is well loosened, then firmly grasp it with the tongs; and let the patient's head be in your lap between your knees, and hold it well so that they do not move.
Then pull the tooth straight out without breaking it, and if it does not come out, take one of these instruments and insert it gently on each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is decayed and damaged, you must fill it with cloth, where the holes are; and grip it carefully with the tongs so that it doesn't break when pulled;
and you must work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, leaving a piece behind, which would cause the patient even greater pain than before due to the harmful nature of the root.
And be careful not to do as ignorant healers do, who through their haste and recklessness sometimes damage the gums and don’t achieve what we have described;
but sometimes, because of this, they cause serious illness due to the roots that remain, or because of the gum tissue they damage, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with ground vitriol;
and if that doesn't work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, which are used to move the teeth first, should have long points and thick handles so they don't bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And they should be of thick parts so they don't bend when pulling, and be made of good Indian steel, and be toothed for a firm grip.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains after pulling, you must put on the spot cotton moistened with butter for one or two days, until the area is softened, then apply the forceps that are called "algefri", whose head resembles a heron's beak;
and inside they are made like a file and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with these forceps, then you must expose the flesh all around the root, and apply the instrument called "althali", that is to say, a levator, of which this is the form:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root jumps out because of this, that is good;
If not, then help yourself with all the instruments, the forms of which follow here below:
And one uses this instrument which has two prongs, of which this is the form: and other iron tools which are earlier in the section on teeth, and this instrument that resembles large forceps/pincers, of which this is the form:
And let this instrument be strong so that it cannot break, and know that there are many dental instruments; and also other instruments, which are not counted/mentioned;
and the wise and subtle master finds for himself his instrument, according to what his works and the illness show him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of bones, and if one does not break the cartilage or the other bones, where it is decayed, then he searches for the instruments that are suitable there, as I have told you, and makes use of the procedures, of which this is the form:
And let them be large and gripping well to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but can be held and removed;
and then restore the place with appropriate medicines, and if there is decay in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When the tooth appears not according to the natural body, and the form is ugly, and especially in young women, then you must know if the tooth has grown behind the (other) tooth, and is not in the right place, and it cannot be filed or polished:
then scrape it; and if there is space beside the tooth, then take this instrument whose form is here, and is similar to a small beak, and let it be made of Indian steel, sharp at its tip:
And cut it little by little over several days, due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is apparent that it can be filed, then file it with such a file as is shown here:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over many days, lightly, so that it does not move until it falls out;
then smooth it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and injures the tongue, it should be filed down until it is even, so that it does not injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
When the front teeth become loose, either by being struck or by falling, and the patient cannot chew what they eat without them falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and it is of no use;
then they must be bound with a gold wire, because silver wire turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and the wire should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth;
and if you want to straighten the teeth, take the wire and put it doubled between the two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, whether there is one or more, until you come carefully to the healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the wrapping up to the part where you began, and tighten it carefully and skillfully with your hand, so that it does not move;
and the ligature should be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the wire with pliers, and bring them together, and fold them back between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not hurt the tongue;
and then leave it tightened as much as possible, and if it comes loose, or the wire breaks, tighten it with another wire;
it will remain and serve thus for its entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the illustration of the straightening of the two healthy teeth and the two loose ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one puts it back in its place, fresh by fresh, as we have said;
and let no one interfere who is not wise and experienced, and sometimes one makes the shape of a tooth from cow bone, and puts it in the place where the defect is, and tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this frenulum that comes from under the tongue is natural, that one is born with; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and have his head on your lap, and lift his tongue;
then cut the nervous frenulum widely, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or a knot, and it is from the healing of a wound, then insert the hook and cut that ligament widely;
and be careful that the cut is not too deep, because of the artery that is underneath;
and when you have finished, wash the area with rose water and vinegar, or with cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue;
and the patient should hold it there each night, so that the area cannot close up.
And if bleeding occurs, apply crushed vitriol to the area; and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it with a lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see it with a dark or black or hard color, so that the patient cannot feel it, do not touch it at all, because it is a canker;
and if it is tending towards white, and there is moisture, then apply a hook, and split it with a fine spatula, and free it on one side and the other; and if the bleeding overcomes you in your work, apply ground vitriol until it is stopped, then return to your work until you draw out all the fire (or core);
then clean the place with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of abscesses of the throat Sometimes lumps come inside the throat which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the section (or chapter), and they are not healed, then take note:
if it is a hard abscess with little feeling and a dark color, do not touch it with iron (a surgical instrument).
And if it is red and the base is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the risk of bleeding; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will rupture on its own;
and if it is a round white color, and the base is thin, have the instrument ready to cut, but first check if the abscess is calm and appeased.
Then have the patient sit facing the sun, with their head in your lap, have them open their mouth, and have the assistant take their head between their hands and press the tongue down with the instrument, the shape of which is shown here;
and it should be made of silver or thin brass like a knife:
When you press the tongue down with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out above as much as you can;
and pull some of the tissue with it, then cut it with the instrument, the shape of which is shown here, that looks like scissors; and the tips are curved, and one towards the other, and are very sharp, and made of Indian steel or hardened steel:
And if you do not have this instrument available, cut it with forceps/pincers, of which the shape is shown here: And let it be sharp on one side, and not on the other;
and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same way, and after the incision, have the patient gargle with hot water, and water and vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water, in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat him until he is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses grow in the throat besides the two tonsils, so cut them in the same way as the two tonsils.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that was inside her throat, that is to say, an abscess of little sensation;
and it had almost completely closed her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and she could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained that way for a day or two.
And the abscess had risen so high that two tubes had been placed through the two nostrils.
I therefore acted quickly and inserted a hook into one of them, then pulled it out, and drew out a large amount of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril, and I worked her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the hook into these abscesses, and cut a part of them, and only a little blood came out; and thus the woman's throat passage was opened, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not stop cutting this abscess for a long time;
and the abscess kept growing back, filling the space that I had emptied, until it was very large again;
then I tricked it and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it stopped growing;
and I left those parts, and I don't know what God did with her after me.
of the uvula
When a rheum descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and elongated, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is large and round underneath, it is called "uvula".
When it is treated as we have described in the section, and the treatment is not effective, and you see that the hot abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and the one that is round and compact and not long; and it is bloody or dark-colored or black, then you must avoid cutting it. For there is great danger for the patient.
It is therefore necessary, when you see it, according to the manner I have described, by its whiteness and its length, that you have the patient sit facing the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument that we mentioned earlier; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned for the incision of the tonsils.
And you must not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have described for the incision of the tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of being cut, then you must use a trick for cauterization without him fearing.
And the manner of the cautery is with sharp water. (or: And the way of the cautery is with sharp water.) And the patient should place his head on your lap, and then you press the tongue with the instrument that we mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and moisten it with hot vinegar, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and fill the hollow of this instrument, of which here is the form:
And it has a bowl at the end where the medicine is placed, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula;
and the patient should be lying on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run out of his mouth with the medicine inside, so that it doesn't go down the throat and harm him;
then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula, for about half an hour, until you see it numbed and the burning sensation of the medicine has subsided;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with the cotton in the mouth above, so that the cotton rests on the uvula;
and do this often, until the cauterization is complete, then leave it to dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to repeat the cauterization with the medicine, then repeat it, and after the cauterization wipe around the uvula, with cotton soaked in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and it should be rinsed with cold water, and treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or than cautery;
if it is treated with fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and oregano and rue and chamomile and southernwood and similar herbs, and put them all together or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and boil it;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hollow instrument like this: And it should be made of silver or brass, and one end should be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is deadened;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula dries up, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the appearance of the hot abscess, because several things can happen; and do not perform this cauterization until the decline of the hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not available, then take a tube and place inside the end an eggshell, so that the patient's mouth is not too hot; because the eggshell does not allow the vapor to irritate the mouth, and this is a good treatment together with healing.
Many times a bone or fishbone, or some other thing, gets stuck in the throat;
therefore you must pull out what you can see, and depress the tongue with the instrument towards the light, so that you can see the thing move;
and what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the stuck object will come out through vomiting;
or have the patient swallow a piece of sponge, or a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a morsel of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it reaches the spot, it will swell, and then you will pull it out;
and if it doesn't come out with what we've said, then take a lead instrument of this shape:
And let the instrument be curved at the end so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the tip raised upwards; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, so that coughing does not occur, nor push the bone inwards;
and it's better that the patient inserts the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is lodged; then he pushes it down, or pulls it out with the instrument evenly, until it is out.
of the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I have said in the division, by the application of medicines; and when that is not effective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed down their tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
And if you see the leech, then pull it out whole with a small hook, or with fine forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if that doesn't work, then take a hollow cane, and put it into the patient's throat, then insert a hot iron into the hollow of the cane, and do this often. And let the patient abstain from water all day.
Then take a glass full of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with his hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it will fall off.
And if it doesn't fall off as we have said, then fumigate the patient with asafoetida, using the instrument I described in the fumigation of the uvula;
Do this several times, because it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot containing live coals, and the pot should be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in this hole should be the head of the instrument;
then throw your fumigant in it, and the patient puts the end of the tube in his mouth and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but reaches the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation several times;
and let the patient be thirsty, and eat salty and sharp things, and do not drink water;
and then it will be necessary that it comes out by this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one extracts the leech, if one can see it, is similar to curved tongs made to enter the throat; and it has a resemblance to the beak of a snipe, and has a roughness from a file, so that what it grips, it cannot release;
There are many kinds of abscesses, as will be recalled later in this book, one after another, and they differ in perforation and in incision;
and this is in two ways, one of which is in its appearance itself, and in that it holds moisture.
And the second way is because of the places where they are on the body.
For an abscess of the head is different from one of the buttocks, and an abscess of a fleshy place is different from one that occurs in the joints, and each has its own treatment in practice.
And there are abscesses that one should not pierce, until the pus is ripe according to its maturation;
and there are some that must be pierced when they are raw, and do not ripen according to their maturation, such as abscesses that are near joints.
For when an abscess develops near the joints, and it is left until it rots around it, by chance the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which causes contraction in that limb.
Or the abscess is near the principal member, and if you delay the piercing until it is ripened, it will harm the principal member;
or it is near the anus, so it is pierced before it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a raw abscess without complete digestion, except for the one that is near the anus, so that it does not rot deeply inside, and become elongated within, and a fistula develops there; and cannot heal for a long time.
And you must know the time for the piercing of the abscess that is ripe according to its completion, and that is when the pain is appeased, and the fever subsides, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and the throbbing and the sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and you should make the perforation in the most dependent place of the abscess, and where it appears soft;
and the perforation should be along the length of the body, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints and near nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no bending. In those that bend, along the length of that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the poison will be elongated, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the edges and the depths of it will harden.
And there are some abscesses that are pierced along the width of the body, according to what the limb requires.
And you must manage, with small abscesses, small openings; and with large abscesses, large openings, and many incisions according to the size of the abscess;
and there are some abscesses where it is necessary to shave the core and cut; when it has become yellow like a cloth, and is dead, one must do as one does with buboes:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some that are cut like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the groin;
and there are some where a round cut is made, and other cuts and similar incisions.
Those that have no head, such as a soft superficial abscess, you must pierce completely;
and when the abscess is large, and it has collected a lot of pus, and you pierce it, do not draw out all the pus at that time, but draw out a part; then plug the abscess until the next day, then draw out some more again; do this many times, little by little, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old man. For the spirit sometimes leaps out with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore avoid this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, wipe the wound and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full incision, then administer tents of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, then you must put a tent in each one so that they come against each other;
and if you have cut into the abscess a part of the skin, and you have lifted it around, then you must fill it with old cotton or lint from linen cloths without moisture, and tie it up until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs during your work, then administer cold water and vinegar, and wet a cloth, and place it on the bleeding area several times.
And if the bleeding continues, administer treatment and care, and the powders that I have mentioned in many places in this book, and if it is in winter, and the area where the abscess is located is very sensitive, then you must put on tents and cloths soaked in warm wine and oil;
and if it is in summer, and the area is fleshy, you should apply cloths soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess and drain it and treat it, as appropriate, until it is healed.
And this should be universally understood in the treatment of abscesses:
Now I have told you how one should proceed in the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
In the head small abscesses arise, and they are like knots which are in webs, like the wattles of a hen, and there are many that are similar.
There are some of them fat and some in which there is moisture like pus;
and there are some which are hard and stony to cut, and there is no danger unless an artery interferes.
And the work of the cutting is that you test with an instrument which is called a "probe," the form of which comes hereafter, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then split it lengthwise from above.
And when the moisture is emptied, then flay without leaving anything of the skin that contains this moisture, for it always returns if anything is left;
then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available; if not, in water and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day; and this will corrode what remains of the dead tissue.
And then replace the cotton, as before, the second day, and the third, until you know well that none of the dead tissue remains;
then treat the wound with a suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess holds a core of fatty substance, cut it along its length, in this way; and insert your hooks, and peel it away on all sides, and put all your effort into drawing out the covering where it lies;
and if the artery gives you trouble, do what I told you afterwards.
And do the same with the abscess if it is stony, both in cutting and treating it as I have told you.
And the incision on a stony abscess, and a moist one, is easier, because they contain little blood. And if some of these abscesses are on the head where there is no moisture, as there was one abscess I cut from the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a rough, coarse, and white stone, and it could not be broken; and if one had struck it, one would have made a wound in it like in a stone.
In other abscesses occurring on the head, except those that come on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the most dependent place, to allow the pus to drain;
and treat them as appropriate.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they come elsewhere on the body, and they are numerous and intertwined with each other.
And each scrophulous swelling is properly within its own membrane, like the kernel and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the variations of these scrofulous swellings are many.
and the variations of these scrofulous swellings are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not respond to treatment.
In the one that you see to be of good disposition to the touch, and is similar to the color of the body, and movable on all sides and is not near the nerves of the neck nor to the artery nor to the throat, and is not deep;
you should cut it from above, and peel it on each side, and spread the two lips of the core with hooks, if you need them, as we have said for abscesses of the head;
and pull it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and the spatula should not be sharp or pointed, so that the hand does not slip, and does not go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this prevents you from working, put ground vitriol into the wound, or some powders that stop blood, and compress the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to rot.
And when the blood is stopped, return to your work, until you have completed it;
then search with your index finger if any small scrofulas remain, then cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, you should not cut this scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scrofula, you must bring the two edges of the wound together, and sew them immediately, then make sure there is no excess remaining due to the size of the scrofula. you must take care to cut the root of it, and draw out fire, and sew it as we have said.
you must take care to cut the root of it, and draw out fire, and sew it as we have said. Those scrofulas that contain excess fluid, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce it like the one mentioned before, downwards, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it dissolves what remains of the corrupted matter; and when the wound is well cleaned, then treat it with ointment generating flesh, until it is healed.
The ancients spoke and discussed the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the opening of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that no help be given by this, because all the veins and the lung of the patient are [affected] in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat or in the two tonsils.
When the illness is in the trachea of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the destruction that comes from strangulation.
It is necessary, then, when we want to cut the epiglottis, that we cut it below three or four rings, a small transverse incision, between the two rings or by the amount of the incision of the uvula, but not in the cartilage;
and this place is suitable for the incision of the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far from there.
And if the practitioner is fearful, it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat with the hook, then cut the flesh until he reaches the trachea; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the uvula, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the expulsion of phlegm from the trachea which jumps out through the place that is opened, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed during which strangulation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound of the flesh, and sew it alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely blocked, and the patient is judged near death, and lacks breath. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this reason the ancients instructed to leave the wound open until the danger of the illness has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they instructed to sew the wound and treat it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw a young woman take a knife, and stick it in her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lung;
and I was called to treat her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood which had come out, and knew well that she had not cut a vein or any vessel but the throat, and the wind was coming out through the wound.
I hurried, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the young woman except that her voice was hoarse, and later returned to normal;
therefore I say that in cutting the epiglottis there is no need for fear.
This abscess is called "throat hernia," and it is a large abscess the color of soot, and is very common in women;
and it is of two kinds: natural, and accidental;
in the natural one there is no trick/deceit.
And the accidental is of two kinds, one of which resembles a fatty knot, and the other kind resembles an abscess that comes from a knotted artery; and there is fear, and it is not appropriate to operate with fire except in the one that is small, and test and examine it with a probe: if you find it like a fatty knot, and it is not attached to any vein, cut it as one cuts knots, and pull it out with its entire covering, if it has any; and carefully examine everything, and treat it as appropriate, until it is completely healed.
There are many kinds of lumps, of which I will describe all the appearances;
and now I must explain all the differences between a lump and an ulcer.
I say that an ulcer involves heat and persistent fever, until the boiling is over, and the suppuration is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With a lump there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a syfac, which is its own sac and is the same color as the body, and begins like a bean and grows large;
and there are two types, either fatty or moist, and of many colors as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to treat the lump, that you first examine and probe it with the instrument called "probe", according to the form which will come in the chapter that follows.
And the way to examine the abscesses of the lumps is that you take the most moist place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, provided that it is according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the probe, and pay attention to what comes out.
If a thin, flowing moisture comes out, note what color it is, and smell it as I have said of other abscesses;
and if no moisture comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty, then cut it crosswise, and take it with forceps, and peel it gently from each side and watch the skin in which it lies so that you pull it out whole with the lump;
and if you cannot pull it out whole, then pull it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the lump will return many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood troubles you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and apply soothing things for a hot abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the lump is large, then sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which generates flesh.
And if the pulsating vein or other [vessel] hinders you, then hurry and fill the area with crushed vitriol, and leave it there for two or three days, until the wound rots, and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cutting what remains of the lump.
Here are the forms of the intermediary instruments, and they are of three types: large and medium and small;
and there are three square ones which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and there are three types of them: large, medium, and small, to probe the abscesses of a fistula;
and they are like the needles with which one sews wounds, and they are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and the yellow ones are worth more, and those made of black lead are better tested for probing the curvature of a fistula;
and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the hooks are of many resemblances, as you see here:
and there are hooks that have two curves of three types also;
and there are hooks that have three curves, and they are also of three types;
and there are hooks that have two curves, and hooks of only one curve, and they are of three types;
and all of these are necessary in their place.
The heads of these with which one cuts are sharp, and of such there are some that do not cut except on one side, with which one flays the sinews, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these inserters are the lancets placed in handles, so that the patients do not perceive them during the opening of abscesses;
and they are of three types: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and they are used only in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and the groin, and in similar places;
and sometimes another small instrument is made, resembling pistachio shells, according to this shape, with which blood is stanched: and it is sometimes placed at the site that heals by severing veins, and arteries, and sometimes they are round according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, so much so that they resemble women's breasts;
and they remain unsightly and swollen, and whoever wants to treat them, must cauterize them according to this shape from this line b. down to g.: then scrape away the fat, and fill the wound with medicine generating flesh, then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops down and is softened by its size as happens with women, then split it into two parts from above, with two similar incisions; of which one is connected to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. down to line g.; then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not fully made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those then that contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b. down to line g.: And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, then fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, then cut it as we have said in the cutting of scrofula, and if the wound produces pus, then administer a cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin over it is closed, an abscess often forms, and the same happens with a swollen and abscessed vein;
and it is recognized as being from the artery because the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightness;
and when it is from the vein, redness from the outside is apparent;
and it is foolish to cut open this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits, in the groin, or on the neck, and in many other places, and is very large. It is therefore necessary to avoid the iron cure, and the one at the head must also be avoided, and in the one that is a swelling of an artery, make an incision along the length above the skin;
then open the incision with hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues until it is exposed;
then place a needle under it, and make it pierce through to the other side, and tie off the artery with a double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then puncture the area between the two ties with a lancet so that the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is drained;
then administer the treatment that causes healing by suppuration, until the ligatures fall off; then treat it with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is because of the cutting of the vein, then you must hold in your hand as much of the abscess as you can, along with the skin, then put the needle under the place that you hold in your hand, and make it pierce through, and have a double thread there, so that you pull it to the other side; then tie off the abscess, as I told you, with a ligature on one of the two sides with the two ends of the thread;
and if you are worried that the thread might come out, then put another needle with a thread under the whole abscess at the incision point of the first needle, and secure the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess flesh and leave what is tied;
then put on a cloth moistened with wine and oil, then administer treatments with tents and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and in the vein, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by excessive work, and similar things.
And this occurs more often in the shoulders and in the fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in several forms without pain;
and when it is pressed firmly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and moves easily in all directions, and goes neither forward nor backward, nor below nor above, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with iron: by chance, contraction would occur there; and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tweezers/forceps and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and peel it, then remove it and bring the wound together with stitching, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes a thelul occurs in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease which is called "fungus" because of its resemblance to them, and its root is thin, and its head large;
and there are some small and some very large;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly that looked more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and they had a slender root, and they had already split open, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them out and found in one eighteen ounces in weight, and in the other six and a half, and the procedure for the incision is that you consider if the patient is moist/phlegmatic, and the color of the growth is white and moist and with a thin root; then cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cauteries ready at hand.
then cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cauteries ready at hand. For during the cutting, excessive bleeding often occurs, and if the blood overcomes you, then hurry to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and afraid of the incision with the iron, then take a well-made lead wire, and tie off the growth as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then tighten it, and do not stop tightening the lead wire until it cuts through the growth, and it falls off by itself without difficulty;
and if the roots are large, be careful when cutting, especially near the abdomen, but you can safely cut away half of it, then cauterize it so it does not grow back;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the swelling which has a pale color and little feeling and a milky appearance.
For this is a cancerous abscess, and I will come to the treatment of cancer later.
when the intestine protrudes outside If the appearance of the intestine comes from a cauterized wound or a ruptured syfac (intestinal abscess/fistula), and it is on the abdomen and some of the intestines protrude, as it happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries depending on what is in front, or from flatulence;
and if it is through the rupture of the syfac and through the exit of the intestine, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and it appears with various openings. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then it is more varied, and when one presses it with their fingers, it withdraws, and then returns, and perhaps it is constricted, and greatly enlarges upon entering the bath and from strong exertion.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and it is readily apparent when you press it with your hand, and it is not constricted;
and if it is due to blood, the abscess appears by these signs: large and hard, and fixed in a certain area; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the task is to see if the appearance is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or flatulence.
and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the task is to see if the appearance is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or flatulence. Then you must abandon the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and lie stretched out straight, then mark with ink all around the swelling; then have them lie face down between your hands, then go around the area you marked with the spatula, then spread half of the abscess above with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the tie be loose;
then open the half of the abscess spread over the tie, and put your index finger in it, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught in the tie, untie it, and push the intestine back inside the belly;
and if you find the swelling, take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein gives you trouble, go around it carefully, then return to your work and take two needles, and thread two strong threads through them, and place the two needles around what you have done in a cross so that you make them pierce [the tissue];
then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the area until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it is thinned and rotted, then treat it as appropriate, and shave the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is thinned and rotted, then treat it as appropriate, and shave the abscess as we have said; and remove the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the area appropriately, and suture the area.
of the canker/ulcer We have spoken in the division about the appearances of a canker/ulcer, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid treatment with iron/surgery;
and we say the canker/ulcer degenerates into necrosis, and great caution is needed in the treatment, and the ancients said that when a canker/ulcer is in a place where it can be scraped, like a canker/ulcer that is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, it should be completely removed when it is in the beginning;
nor has anyone ever healed one before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you sometimes purge the patient of black bile;
then have them bled if there is manifest plethora, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure;
then cast your hooks or pincers, and pull it from all sides, and remove it completely without leaving anything behind;
and let the blood flow freely, and press the area well with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already discussed in the division the different types of dropsy, and how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type, and the treatment that is done with medicines, and that which is treated with iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two types: that is to say, tympanites and ascites, because it is a fatal thing;
Therefore, when you treat this type of dropsy which is called "anasarca" with medicines, and the treatment is not effective, then see if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as coughing and diarrhea and similar things; do not touch it with iron, because there is danger;
and if you see the patient is of strong constitution, and they have no other illness than just dropsy, and they are not too young nor too old, then you should proceed as follows: Lift the patient upright with your hands, and an assistant should press the belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the abdomen, then take the thorned spatula made in this way: And let it be sharp on both sides. with a point, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestine when inserted, and not be able to wound it;
then see if the dropsy originates from near the intestines: then you must cut above the navel three fingers directly below, towards the pubic bone; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the navel;
and if it's because of the spleen, let it be on the right, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the excess fluids don't flow to that weak spot;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, push it in, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the superficial fascia as if skinning, about the size of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the superficial fascia until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the location of the fluid, then pull it out, and insert this instrument of which here is the form: And it is similar to a thin silver tube, and it is made of light brass or bronze, and has a small hole in the lower part; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribe cuts the pen:
at the top is the wing, so that when the instrument comes to the point, it immediately descends onto the instrument;
then empty half or a third, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the release of his spirit from the soul, or he will faint, or he will approach death;
but empty it according to the quantity of his strength, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's strength indicate, and his pulse;
then withdraw the instrument and hold the needle, and it is held immediately by the core that plugs the hole that is on the syfac, of which I have spoken, which you pierce in this way;
then start the instrument again the next day, if you see the patient tolerating it, and draw out a small amount of fluid;
do this for a few days, and be careful not to drain so much that nothing remains but a small amount of fluid.
And if you are concerned about the patient, and you leave a lot of fluid, treat him with burial in warm sand, and with much sweating or baths and in the sun, and let him abstain from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize over the stomach and over the liver and over the spleen after the extraction of the fluid, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born without an opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in the right place.
So it is necessary to pierce it immediately with a very fine spatula according to this form/method:
Then put in the opening a fine nail of lead, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days and when he needs to urinate, the nail should be removed, and let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, because the urine that comes out will not let it close.
He whose opening is small, is treated with the lead nail, as we have said, so it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born with the opening at the tip of the penis, so they cannot urinate forward unless they raise their penis up; and cannot procreate because the semen cannot reach the vagina, and this is a bad condition.
And the method of the procedure is that the patient lies on his back, then you extend the tip of the penis and cut it like the width of a quill, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and beware of bleeding which often occurs there, and if it happens, staunch it with something that stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of pustules of the penis Many times these sores appear on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh;
and some are malignant and some are not malignant; (or, and there are malignant ones and non-malignant ones)
so you should take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then apply cotton moistened with Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the sore is malignant, of a foul color and suppurating, then you must apply cautery to it.
When you have cut it, and if the ulcer is at the tip of the penis, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, you must first remove the ulcer that is inside; and when it is stitched up, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it all together, the head of the penis is not protected from being pierced, and blackness and corruption comes into the penis and into the testicle;
so it is necessary to remove everything that is black and corrupted, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate peel and vetches, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, apply the lunar cautery in this way:
The cautery helps with both conditions together: that is, the bleeding and the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupted and retracted, you must insert a lead tube into the urethra, and the patient should urinate through it;
and when the skin is tight at the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it occurs due to a wound or an abscess, then you must peel it back with a pointed instrument, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is difficult to separate this, then you must peel it back with a spatula a little from the head of the penis and the skin;
then gently separate the two, and insert a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water, so that it doesn't tighten again.
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this procedure by choice, specifically on children, it is necessary that we do the best work, and the most conducive to healing.
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, for it was not practiced in their law, and we have only what we have learned through experience.
For I have seen the majority of masters and healers perform circumcision around the first day, forcefully, and with a razor;
thus the skin fled, for there are two layers, and by chance they would cut the upper one and leave the one below. Then it was necessary to cut it again, and the pain was doubled, and during the cleansing, which takes place on the eighth day, the tip of the member is not safe;
and during the cleansing of the nail, by chance the iron slips, and they ruin the work, and often they are born such that they do not need cleansing and I have seen it.
Regarding the cleansing which is done forcefully with a linen thread, I have found the experiment to be good, for the threads cut evenly both above and below.
For when you squeeze your hand, you cut evenly in a single instant; but the thread must be tightly wrapped around the skin;
and the way of the first procedure is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then you make him happy in all the ways you can;
then have him stand straight between your hands, and hide the threads between your hands or under your feet so that the child cannot see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand on the penis and blow in the opening, and pull it upwards until the glans of the penis is inside; then clean it well of the dirt that has accumulated there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below, a little further down, with another tie;
then clean it well of the dirt that has accumulated there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below, a little further down, with another tie; and hold it with two fingers by the second tie with the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the glans and pull the tip of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, because that is the best; and put powder on it and over the powder a cloth soaked in a mixture of cooked egg yolk diluted with rose water, blended with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The method of strengthening for cleansing is this:
The two edges should be thin and sharp, and the edges should be as wide as the handle equally:
The error of cleansing is when the core inside escapes the incision;
Then you must expand it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, hold it with forceps, and then cut it.
And if it goes beyond three days, and what is under the penis is swollen, leave it until the hot abscess is subsided, and peel it lightly;
cut it as best you can, and be careful of the part of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with wound-healing powders, as we have described in the section on powders, and if one cuts from the heart excessively, and it goes above, it will not cause harm;
treat it then, as we have said, until it is healed.
of urinary retention
Urinary retention is caused by a blockage from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or dead flesh, or similar things, as we have said in the classification;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone which is located at the neck of the bladder, then the patient must be bent over his knees; and his feet should be placed on his back, and extend his belly from the top toward his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is forced to expel the stone upwards, which allows the urine to be released;
and if it does not come out, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called "syringe," of which this is the form:
and it should be made of thin, light silver, shaped like a bird's feather; and the cannula should be a palm and a half long, and thin at the end.
And the way to release the urine is this: you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the end, and put the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut the excess wool and push it up to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and sprinkle the bladder and penis with warm oil and olive oil and lukewarm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the base of the penis, then bend the penis over towards the buttocks;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty space, and this is not done according to this order except because the passage where it goes is twisted;
then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine will follow the wool, then pull it out, and let the urine flow;
and reinsert the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When excoriations or blood appear in the bladder, or pus has collected there, and you want to instill waters and medicines, then make the instrument that is called "clepsydra", and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three holes: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the nozzle end through which the medicine flows should be such that it fits tightly into the penis without anything added, so that one can draw out the moisture, and inject when necessary;
and when you want to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the end of the catheter in the liquid, and draw on the suction device that is inside;
thus you will draw the moisture into the catheter, and then push the suction device back in firmly; so the liquid will enter and go directly to the bladder, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the thin clyster with which one irrigates the bladder:
And it is made of silver or brass, and the head is higher up;
and underneath has a cavity where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you want to irrigate the bladder, then tie it firmly between the two cavities with a good double thread, and warm this liquid a little over the fire;
then insert the tip of the clyster into the penis, then squeeze your hand on the bladder evenly with the liquid, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you don't have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around; then thread a strong string through these holes, then gather the circle as one gathers a bag, and put inside what you want of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, squeezing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already spoken, in the section on types of stones, and their extraction, along with medications;
and have explained the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stone one should operate surgically; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you plainly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder occurs more often in children, and it is a sign that the liquid coming from the bladder resembles water in its clarity;
and sand appears in it, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down often, and then hardens; and he has a lot of these discharges from the bladder;
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and is very difficult in old men, and is moderate in young men, for those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and shake him and move him downward, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes jumps up from the high place;
then have him sit prepared between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards;
then search for it and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut on the stone.
And if it does not fall at the touch at all, wet your index finger with oil, of the left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if the patient is a fully grown youth; and put it in his anus, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, guide it to the neck of the bladder;
then press down with your finger, and push it outside where you intend to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and tell him to lift the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand to pull back the skin which is beneath the testicles in the area where one makes the incision;
then place there the cutting spatula, of which this is the form: And cut between that which is between the testicles and the anus, not in the middle but to the side of the left buttock;
and be directly over the stone, and keep your fingers always in the anus, and make the incision transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow within, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps press it with the finger that is in the anus, so that it may leap out without difficulty;
and know that there are some stones with angles and edges: thus it is difficult to extract;
and there are some that are smooth, resembling an acorn, and round, whose extraction is easy.
In the case of those that have angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not jump out, you must then tighten the forceps that are like a file at the end, to firmly grasp the stone so that it does not escape; or you insert underneath it a subtle instrument curved at the end;
and if you cannot manipulate it thus, widen the opening a little, and if the blood flows, staunch it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first push the largest to the neck of the bladder, then cut down on it, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterward if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawn, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly flows from there so the area cannot heal;
but nevertheless strive to pull it out, or break it up with forceps, until you remove it piece by piece;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with frankincense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and put over it a cloth moistened with oil and wine, or with oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then turn the patient onto his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, wash the area very well with oil and water, then treat it with diachylon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come in the wound and corrosion, and clotting of blood in the bladder, and because of this the urine is retained, which is recognized in such a way that blood comes with the urine: then put your finger in the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will corrode the bladder, and rot it;
then wash the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and help him in all the ways you know, until he is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, that you tie his two thighs together, and apply the medicines on the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and stuck there, and the urine cannot come out; if you treat it with what I mentioned before, that you cut him many times, one is excused from cutting due to this treatment. I have already proven this.
Take an iron drill of this shape and let it be three-sided, stuck in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder;
then insert the drill into the penis lightly, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand into the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the penis. It is immediately broken, and comes out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
and if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, then tie one thread below the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the location of the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
It rarely happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it does happen sometimes, then the treatment is difficult, and is problematic for three reasons:
the first is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will reveal herself to doctors, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman skilled in this manual art;
and the fourth reason is that the woman's stone is deeper than the man's stone, which is why it requires a deeper cut, and there is great fear. And if necessity compels this, then you must take a very knowledgeable midwife, and they are hardly found, and if you don't find one, then seek a chaste and subtle physician;
and present her a wise matron, experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows some of the art, and instruct her to do what you command regarding the examination of the stone; and look carefully to see if the woman is a virgin:
and look carefully to see if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and instruct the patient to insert her finger into her vagina, and search and press firmly with her left hand on the bladder.
If she finds it, she should move it little by little from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it comes to the root of the thigh;
then cut down on the stone at the root of the thigh opposite the middle of the vulva, where it is prepared and soft, and feel the stone in that area; and don't move her finger from above or below the stone, and let the incision at first be small;
and don't move her finger from above or below the stone, and let the incision at first be small; then insert the hook into the incision, if you feel the stone then enlarge the wound until the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large and rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have branches.
so know the appearances in order to understand the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, apply ground vitriol to the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stanched;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about in the extraction of stones in men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, put the powder on the place and bind it with tents and bandages, and do not start this again, and leave the stone and do not pull it out, because perhaps the patient would die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is calmed, and the place festers, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
Aqueous hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white syfac, which is below the shell of the testicles, that contains the testicle;
and is called "syfac", and sometimes it is actually within the lining of the testicle, so that one thinks it is another testicle; and it is the skin of the scrotum between the white syfac that we have mentioned;
and this occurs infrequently. And the development of this hernia comes from weakness in the testicles, and this matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this fluid has many colors: either a color tending towards jaundice, or it is blood red, or black, or watery white, and this occurs more often;
and these are the signs to recognize this gathering, for if it is in the white syfac (hydrocele) that we have mentioned, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle is not visible, because there is fluid all around it.
And if there is fluid in the tunic itself, the abscess is round with part of the testicle, and because of this, it is thought to be another testicle;
and if the fluid is between the skin of the testicles and the white tunic, it can be felt easily;
then when you want to know the color of the fluid, examine it with the square intromissor, the shape of which is shown above. According to what comes out after the intromissor, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron (cautery), the patient should be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body;
then have him lie on his back, on something slightly raised, and place many cloths under him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the penis to one of the two testicles from the heart of the scrotum;
then take the milk-white spatula, and cut the skin of the scrotum lengthwise from the base to near the tip, and let your incision be perfectly straight, dividing the skin of the scrotum down to the white tunic, and peel it back subtly as much as possible;
then pierce the tunic full of water with a large hole, and draw out all the water, then insert your hooks and stretch the tunic upwards;
and do not touch the testicle itself, only the tunic; cut it all or in pieces likewise the thickened part of it delicately, because if you do not cut it carefully, the water will return;
and if the testicle happens to be outside during your work, replace it when you have completed the work on the tunic;
then bring together the two edges of the testicle with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, then you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, to prevent the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle along with the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if fluid is collected in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part as you did the first one equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
then cut the other part as you did the first one equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and above put other wool soaked in wine and oil, and place it on the two testicles, and put on top folded cloths, and tie it up with the bandage that is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this likeness, and let them be joined by stitching at the opening of the pants, and one of the ends should go over the buttocks up to the back, and the other to the penis area;
and the other two ends over the two groins, and let all the bandage be gathered in the buckle of the pants;
and sometimes this ramification is treated with cautery instead of cutting with iron, and you should take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white membrane that contains the water is exposed;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce this membrane with hooks, and peel it off with this thin, hot cautery:
And cut it in all the ways that you can, until you extract it all;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this method is safer; and with less risk of bleeding, and better than surgery;
and if anything gives you trouble, like a hot abscess or bleeding or something else, treat that which troubles you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is afraid, and does not want to endure this procedure because of its dreadfulness, then perform a perforation, as I tell you, which is, when you are quite certain by the signs we have described that there is watery pus there, have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with the spatula wide open, and position the perforation lengthwise along the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the liquid runs out freely;
then put cotton on the area, and bind it, and leave it to drain the remaining liquid, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the liquid to flow from the opening of the wound, then you must insert a feather or the instrument used to draw liquid from dropsical patients, the form of which is shown above;
and widen the wound a little, and know that the liquid will return, and accumulate again after six months or around then, and when it has accumulated as before, the patient will continue this way throughout his life.
Know that in the treatment of this branch (of medicine), there is fear in many situations, therefore it seems to me it is better to leave it alone;
and I will tell you the procedure and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses occur in the body, and particularly in the testicles; and this is for many reasons.
That is to say by an excess of sour and sharp (humor), which spreads to the testicles, or from a blow;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and there is no pain, and it is a serious abscess;
and sometimes there is a severe, pale, and stony abscess, and of a weak color, and sometimes it comes from damage to an artery, or from swelling of a vein.
When it is from damage to an artery, it is known by the disposition of a warm abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it.
The one that is made from the swelling of a vein is known by its disposition to the pressure of the touch of the fingers, and one can well make the incision on this appearance, and on the other flesh; and you must cut the heart of the testicles, then stretch the egg upwards, and pull it away from the white membrane, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the egg.
If the testicle is already adhered to this new flesh, then you must pull the testicle, and cut it;
and if there is air in the tunica vaginalis, or in that which is inside the vessels, then you must free all this membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the growth of the flesh is in the back part, then you must cut it all, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, then fill the wound with wool moistened in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering resembling a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the treatment of this illness is almost as dangerous as the one before, and yet we will tell you the procedure for it, according to what the ancients did.
You must have the patient sit on a raised seat, then push the suspensory of the testicles down with your fingers, along with the vessels that are next to the penis, and have the assistant hold them, and stretch them firmly;
then cut with a wide, transverse cutting spatula near the vessels, until they are exposed, and then dissect on each side, as we have described in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the screw came, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted fluids;
then treat the wound like the others where you generate pus, unless some vessel falls that nourishes one of the testicles;
for no harm comes from this, and if a screw comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to pull the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and they dry up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to the tear that happens in the peritoneum/abdominal wall, or the stretching over the belly in the area of the groin, which causes the intestines to descend through this rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the peritoneum/abdominal wall itself, or from its stretching, and these two types arise from many causes:
from a blow, or a jump, or shouting, or lifting a heavy load, and similar things;
and the signs, when it is from the stretching of the peritoneum/abdominal wall, are that it occurs little by little, over a long time, and does not happen suddenly; and the swelling is even down to the depths, because the peritoneum/abdominal wall presses upon the intestine.
And the sign, when it is from a tear in the peritoneum/abdominal wall, is that it causes sudden pain at the onset, and the swelling appears uneven, close under the skin, and this is because of the protrusion of the intestine and body outside of the peritoneum/abdominal wall.
And sometimes the omentum descends with the intestine, and is retained there, and causes the patient to suffer great pain, especially when it is pressed.
And in these treatments, one is afraid of iron (cautery), so it should be avoided.
And the way to do this is to instruct the patient to put the intestine back inside the wound with his hand, if he can put it back in; then he should be supported on his neck between your hands, and lift his thighs;
then spread the scrotum above, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then insert hooks into the lips of the incision as needed to open the wound, and they should be such that the egg can come out;
then peel away the tunic which is under the skin of the testicles, until the hard white tunic is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white tunic which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second tunic, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second tunic;
and then move with your right hand inside the scrotum, and stretch the white tunic upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all the tunic towards the incision; and instruct the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and untie that which is attached behind the ligature;
and search with your fingers if there is any of the intestine wrapped in the hard white tunic, and if you find any, push it back into the abdomen;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten strands, and put it in the back part of the tunic, which is behind the skin of the scrotum; after the incision, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, so that there are four threads; then bring them together, one on top of the other, in the form of a cross, and tie the tunic, which we said is under the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature in two places; then wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly in two places, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter it, preventing an abscess from forming; and place another ligature along the first ligature, two fingers' length from it, and after these two ligatures, leave a finger's width of the tunic, which is under the skin of the scrotum; and then all the rest, following the roundness of the testicle;
then cut in the part that is under the skin of the scrotum, until the blood and pus flow, as we have said before;
then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wounds, and apply the ligature that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white tunic that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding. For this happens often, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, then it should be moistened with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is completely healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this affliction, I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with a knife.
And the ancients said that it is done like the hernia that is together with the screw, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after cutting above them lightly underneath;
then cut it in the middle, and treat the abscess with something that opens it, until the vessels fall off;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes rupture comes in the groin, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the testicles, and if some do descend, it is little, and returns all the time;
and yet if it remains too long in this state, the wound or fistula grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens because of the extension of the fistula that is in the groin, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place softens and swells and opens;
and the treatment is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is treated with iron in this manner: and the patient lies supine between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture widely, about the width of three fingers;
and then extract the fistula that is under the skin that follows it, then take the thread and put it on the visible place of the fistula;
and press it deep into the belly, then sew the two visible places of the fistula over the end of the thread, and sew both;
then pull the end of the thread, and do not cut the fistula or spread egg or anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia; then treat it by the treatment of wounds.
then treat it by the treatment of wounds. And when you cut the threads, clean it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The fistula is constricted, and has no opening in the rupture, and the cautery is more moderate in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh inside is softened, and it is milky in appearance;
and it is necessary, when one wants to treat it, to make the patient lie on his back, and cut the skin that is softened down to the natural skin;
then join the two edges with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and treat it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
of castration
Know that castration is condemned in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the physician should know how to answer when asked about it, and know the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.
In the one that we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging down; then take them in your hand, until they are drawn back and you no longer feel them.
On castration by cutting: you must restrain the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the spermatic cord, and cut each testicle with one cut, once you have skinned them well;
and leave there some of the thick and thin membranes which are on the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by pulling, because with pulling, some part of the testicles might remain, by which the animal still desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism exists in two ways in humans: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the form of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other type is in women, and they have above the pubis something like a penis and two testicles.
And the treatment for the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh and treat them like other wounds;
in the second type, for men whose urine spurts through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tentigo is an extra growth of flesh on the genitals, so much so that it is very ugly to see; and some women have it as big as a hand, and this is the treatment.
You must grasp the excess of the tentigo in your hand or with hooks, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, so that bleeding does not occur, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and there is another growth that arises at the opening of the vagina, and fills it, and sometimes protrudes, and has the appearance of a tail, and therefore the ancients called it "tailed malady". So you must cut it, as we have described for the tentigo, and treat it until it is healed.
Erysipelas occurs when a woman's nature is not pierced, or the opening is small; and it is natural by birth, or accidental through illness that has come there;
and it is natural by birth, or accidental through illness that has come there; or it is because of added flesh, or from thin or thick syphac, and is made deep within the womb, or on the sides, or below, or wherever it may be;
and it prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps having menses;
and the diagnosis of this is by examination of the vulva.
If the blockage is clearly apparent, search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
If it is from thin syphac, and it is near the two lips, hurry, and round it like this:
put your two index fingers together, and let the woman be on her back, with her legs spread;
then spread the two lips firmly, until the thin syphac is round, and the blockage is opened;
then take wool, and soak it in oil, and put it on the place, and let the woman lie at home each day, so that it cannot close up.
And if the syphac is hard and thick, you must cut it with a myrtle-leaf shaped spatula.
If the blockage is of newborn flesh, then lift it with a hook and cut it;
and have blood-stopping medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, mixed with egg white;
then insert a large lead tube so the wound cannot close;
and leave it there for a long time, and insert a dry linen tent;
then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And when proud flesh grows in the marrow, it should be cut in this manner, unless it is a cancerous abscess. For a cancerous abscess that is in the marrow, one should not touch it with iron (a surgical instrument).
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when hemorrhoids are old they become bluish/livid;
and we have already discussed in the division their characteristics and symptoms, and I will discuss here those that can be treated.
I say that hemorrhoids and livid swellings, when they are deep in the marrow, and they are not perceptible to the touch, should not be treated with iron (a surgical instrument).
Those that are at the mouth of the anus, that can be felt, are the ones that can be treated.
You must then place the woman in a cold room, then grasp the hemorrhoid with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle on medicines to stop the bleeding, such as acacia and dragon's blood and frankincense, and similar things;
then have her put her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if bleeding occurs, have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peel and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice of it on her back.
And if it stops, that's good. If not, apply cupping glasses to her back and breasts without scarification;
then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or wild rose juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and the one that is called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough head, it must be cut like I described for the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the marrow, such as canker and stony abscess and herpes and estiomene and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and several other diseases that I mentioned in the division.
It is therefore necessary that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the marrow, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you want to know the work of iron (cautery), see if the abscess is acute at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not rush to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain subsides;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where they lean, and support their back and bring their feet together towards the lower part of the leg;
and let their thighs be spread, and place their arms under their knees, and tie them well with a good bandage;
then suck from him towards the right side, and use the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the bladder (urethra), the form of which comes later;
and it is necessary that when you use this instrument, you first insert the probe to know the depth of the bladder, so that what enters with the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is too large, you must cover the depth of the bladder with cloths, so that the instrument does not hurt them;
and he must put the funnel of the instrument on top, and hold the instrument.
And when the abscess opens, and it is made soft by hand, it should be cut at the top, with a milk spatula;
and when the boil is emptied, you must put in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dried green oil;
and put the tent away from the wound in the depth of the bladder, and put outside, on the bladder and on the scalpel, clean wool soaked in water where mallows have been boiled;
then treat it after two days with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes the bladder and the wound are cleaned with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water in which roots of lily and long birthwort have been boiled; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is returned to the bladder, you must avoid cauterizing with iron, but treat it as we have described in the section.
on childbirth The midwife must first understand the process of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pushing downwards, and desires to smell aromatic scents:
then the child hurries to come out; then know that this birth is according to the natural process, and the exit is under its head, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, you should press lightly on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends headfirst, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its excess fluids by a good cleansing;
and the one that comes differently does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes feet first, and the body or the head comes out first, and the hands, or it comes out on its stomach, or sideways, and is sometimes turned on its neck, and in other bad positions;
so it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skilled in these things, and to beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions and how one should help.
If the child comes headfirst in a natural way, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, have her sit on a chair, where the women will hold her;
and stimulate her nature with oil or cooked fenugreek, and then the midwife should put between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the form: and tear the afterbirth, and cut with her fingernail until the moisture that is inside runs out;
and press the woman's belly so that the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil;
then make her sneeze using condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: the child will come out immediately.
And if both hands come out, you must gently push them back in little by little; and if they cannot enter, place the woman on a seat and raise her feet up high; then suddenly drop the seat to the ground, and someone should hold the woman so she doesn't fall during the drop;
and if the hands cannot enter and the child dies, cut off the hands with the knife previously mentioned, and extract the child, and reposition it properly.
of the delivery of the child on its feet When the child comes feet first, you must push it upwards; and then turn it little by little, until it is straight;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When he jumps up to the thighs, instruct her to take them, and make her sneeze with pepper; then he will jump out, God willing.
And if it doesn't come out as we have said, then turn it little by little until it is in accordance with its natural form. For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and apply it to the woman's genitals inside and outside with this ointment, then have her sit in warm water up to below the ribs;
and when she is softened below, make her a pessary of myrrh, and place it inside her, and leave it for an hour; then have her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and hold her mouth and nose, and press lightly on her belly, for the child will jump out immediately.
of the delivery of the child onto its knees When the child comes in this manner, the midwife should put her hands there little by little; then it should be supported by its neck, and its feet hanging down, and it should be lying on a bed; and fold its hands little by little, and then take its hands on its belly, and remove the cushions from beneath, so that it is positioned downwards; and if the child does not jump, then take its feet and move them strongly, then move its belly upwards, then push your hands there; and rock the child gently; and instruct the woman to push until the child comes out.
regarding the delivery of a child who comes out hand first One must skillfully work to bring the hand back: if one cannot bring it back, then have the woman stand up and walk;
if she cannot walk, then have her lie down on a bed, and raise her legs firmly;
then administer the lubricating preparation that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, have her sit on a seat, then work on bringing the hand back; and deliver the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and tell her to push until the child comes out.
with the child coming out onto its neck, and its hands spread out, and its face turned towards its mother's back It is necessary that the midwife hold her hand, then turn it little by little, and deliver it gently;
And when it is even, apply a mixture of marshmallow root and oil to the area, as we have said, then tell her to move little by little;
And when you have done this, have her sit on a chair, and tell her to push; and make her sneeze. In this same way with the entire afterbirth.
In this same way with the entire afterbirth. When it comes out in this way with the entire afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until the moisture is drained;
And if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the navel so that it is not held back and the child dies;
Then push the child inside, until you have positioned it as it should be, and tell the woman to bear down sometimes:
of the delivery of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, and it happens rarely. Two are a strange thing, and do not usually live, except rarely;
Two are a strange thing, and do not usually live, except rarely; I know this, that they are multiplied, and are separated by the membrane that divides them, which is attached to the uterus;
and sometimes they emerge as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they come out with difficulty, treat them as we have said, and let the midwife be skilled, and do what she does quickly and lightly; and act in such a way as is best for their well-being. of multiple children
Sometimes one or two or three or four or five or six or seven are formed in the womb, or more, up to fifteen, and they are all formed in the shape of a child by the measure of the glorious wise [God?], and the midwife must know all this, for perhaps such a thing will happen to her; so let her act accordingly.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in the womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to work by hand; you must know if the woman is of sound health, and has no condition where she is afraid of death;
the woman should be lying on her back, with her head inclined downwards and her legs raised;
and the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled down with the descent of the child;
then rub the vulva of the mother with moist oils with mucilage of marshmallow and fenugreek and linseed, then have the midwife anoint her hands with these oils and mucilages;
then insert them gently into the vulva, then find a place where she inserts the hooks that are suitable for this, and take care if the child is positioned to descend head first;
insert the hooks into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the fontanelle or near the temples, and if the descent is feet first, insert them in the heel and in the middle of the sides;
and he should hold the hook in his right hand, and place the curvature between the fingers of his left hand, and insert it with his whole hand gently, and insert the hook in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it comes to the empty space;
then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if you need it, so that the extraction is even;
and then pull it evenly, moving from one side to the other, to cause it to come out, and the hook should be toothed to hold it, as is the shape here:
And if a part of it remains, then let the surgeon anoint some of his fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and pull out the other part;
and if any of it still remains, then place this hook in a higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and he cannot pull it back due to the tightness, then you must wrap a cloth around it, until it comes all the way out; then cut it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and so you must do with the other hand, and with both feet.
And if the child's head is large and the birth canal is narrow, or if there is a pointed gathering on the head, you must place the pointed spatula between your fingers, and split the head and extract the fluid; or you break it with the instrument called "almidach", whose form comes with the instruments in the chapter which is after this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with the forceps, and if the head jumps out and is caught in the vulva, let it be split, so that the fluid that is in the worst place comes out;
and if it cannot come out, cut it in pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or below the ribs, then you must pierce it so that the fluid flows.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the straightening at the opening of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or the chest, you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut the belly or the chest so the fluid within can flow out;
And if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife should put her hand deep into the womb and pull it down to the opening of the womb; then insert one or two hooks, and pull it out forcefully;
And if the opening of the womb is constricted because of a hot abscess that has developed there, do not work on it, but rather administer moist and oily things; and apply poultices, and sitz baths with softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can straighten it, apply what we have said for a live child;
and if one cannot, then pull it out piece by piece, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, apply what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if bleeding occurs, she should be placed in astringent water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another was conceived over that one, and the second also died. After a long time, she developed an abscess in the buttock, and it swelled until it opened, and began to suppurate heavily.
I was called for the treatment, and I considered it for a long time, and the wound would not heal.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out, and after a few days another one. I was very surprised, because there are no bones in the belly.
So I thought that they were the bones of a dead child.
I searched the wound, and drew out many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time like this, and a little bit of pus always came out of the place;
and I would not have recalled this chapter except for the fact that, when the physician encounters a strange case, he should know how to provide help.
Here follows the shape of the press, with which one squeezes books;
and with two turns at the two ends of the two cords. However, the horn should be more slender than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the wood should be one finger wide, and the edge of the boards one finger, and the length a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two planks should be two additions of this same wood, which should be attached to each, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two additions are placed at the mouth of the hammer to open it when one turns the two cords.
Another form, resembling it but more slender and lighter, is made of ebony or boxwood, like tongs; and it has at the two ends two additions, as you see, of a palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you want to open the hammer with the whole instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, feet hanging and legs open, then put the two additions joined together into the hammer, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then open your hand with the whole instrument, as you did with the tongs evenly, according to how much you want to open the mouth of the hammer, until the midwife does what she wants.
These instruments are all surmounted, and their forms are multiplied; and when the physician has prepared them, the work is more rapid, and better for men because of their quantity.
So do not despise the instrument so that you don't have it prepared, because their necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained at childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with pepper, and hold your hands over her mouth and nose; and if it comes out because of this, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the womb's opening, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, birthwort and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be cooked in a pot in water over the fire;
then put one end of a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the opening of the womb, and hold it there so that the steam enters the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. The afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to wet her left hand in sesame oil or in marshmallow mucilage, and then put it in the vagina, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, she should take it and pull it little by little, straight out, so that the womb does not fall out during the extraction;
but she should move it gently to the right and to the left, and then pull; thus it will come and be detached.
And if the opening of the womb is already narrowed, we have described the treatment of sneezing, and of fumigation with herbs;
and if it does not come out with all that we have said, be careful not to be foolish in pulling;
but what is at the opening of the womb, you must tie it to the woman's thigh, then administer an enema of tetrapharmacum ointment; thus it will rot and soften, and come out;
however, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. So then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
some of the ancients tried fumigation of watercress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is made of glass, similar to a cane, and one puts the narrow end in the genitals, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be over the coals, and let it burn until it is used up, and start another one.
Many children are born who do not have a pierced anus, but it is blocked by a thin membrane: therefore the midwife must pierce this membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp spatula, and take care that she does not touch the band (frenulum);
then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you are worried that it will close up again, put a lead tube in the hole, and leave it for several days, and remove it when the child needs to go to the toilet.
And sometimes this blockage comes from the healing of a wound or an abscess; so it is necessary to cut this adhesion: then it should be treated, as we have said, with the lead tube.
Fistulas that come from below the anus are swellings, and growths that come near the outside of the anus, or in the space between the two parts, and it can be a single fistula or several;
and when this swelling is old, it opens and emits moist white pus or thin excrement, and sometimes these fistulas are perforating;
and they are recognized because there comes out either excrement or flatulence when the patient defecates, and sometimes a worm comes out.
And there are fistulas that penetrate up to the bladder, and up to the middle of the penis; and extend up to the hip joint, and up to the base of the spine.
And thus one recognizes the fistula penetrating the anus, and the non-penetrating one: and you put your index finger in the anus, and insert a thin needle of brass or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then insert a thin lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger;
and if you don't feel it, and no discharge or flatulence or worms come from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not penetrate; so hurry to treat it.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urethra, urine will leak out, and it cannot be healed with medicines.
If it is pierced to the hip joint, then the probe reaches that place; if there is no tortuosity and the source of the pain is around it, then pus constantly comes out, and neither medicine nor healing ointment is effective;
and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure but work, and the vanity of foolish physicians who meddle with them.
In one that is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of healing by surgery, as I have experienced, and the patient should lie on their back in your hands;
and lift their legs up to their thighs, and have their thighs bent towards their belly; then insert a probe of brass, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the probe reaches.
If the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger there, then feel if the probe has pierced it;
and if it is uncovered where you feel between your finger the abdominal wall or the flesh, then you know that it is penetrating; so do not work on it because it cannot be healed.
It is said, however, that some can be healed, but this happens rarely;
and the help that is given is to heat the thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as was said before; and insert it, very hot, into the fistula, until it reaches near the rectum; and do this two or three times, until you know that these decayed tissues are burned, which resemble a bird's feather;
and then treat it with tents soaked in butter, until this tissue comes out, then treat it with ointment that generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, that is good.
If not, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the probe enters, and does not reach down to the finger that is in the rectum, and between your finger and the probe there is a thick covering of flesh or tissue, and you see the fistula below that which follows the covering of the heart; then cut it from the beginning of the fistula, and push the probe further in, and then the cautery after it, until it reaches the end of the probe; and the probe will be released, and will fall out;
then clean the damaged tissues that resemble a bird's feather, leaving nothing behind.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine.
For the fire cautery combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of this excess flesh, and the stopping of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat it with tents soaked in butter or in crushed things, until the place produces pus, and the burnt flesh comes out with the pus;
then treat the wound with generating, drying ointments that produce hard flesh, and these are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula reaches deep into the anus, and is far from the body, put your finger into the anus and examine it.
If you feel the tent, and between the two is the cloth or the syfac or flesh, or it is close to piercing through, then there is nothing but a path of confidence and hope, by the application of one of the three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it all the way to the bottom, or if you can, you insert tents and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, so that you do not cut the tissue that holds the anus, and the excrement comes out involuntarily; then treat it as we have said;
then treat it as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it has been cut near the anus, either with a tent or another suitable instrument; then clean the damaged flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then work to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the area outside the anus:
then work to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the area outside the anus: thus it will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes there are fistulas in this way: and it is when you put the tent in the fistula, and it is in the side of the anus near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the end in this way: And put a twisted thread doubled, and put the tent with the thread into the fistula until it is at the end.
If it pierces the edge of the anus inside, then pull the thread out of that hole, so that you put your finger in the anus;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and tie one to the other, and leave it for a day or two;
and tighten it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and they fall off;
then treat the wound until it is closed and healed.
If the fistula does not pierce, make it pierce in any way you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to cut too deeply for the ligature, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the pointed scalpel with which one cuts the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and not on the other, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: either they are inside the anus, like a grain of resin, and there are small and large ones, and blood constantly flows from them, and there is one or more, and they are outside the anus and at the end of the anus;
but those that are outside have little moisture, and constantly leak a little yellow water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those who have them inside the anus is that you instruct the patient to strain while going to the toilet, so that the anus protrudes, and the threads appear; then hurry, and grasp it with forceps, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, grasp them with a cloth, or with cotton, or with a piece of chamois; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and powder over them some hot powders that act as a cautery; or you cauterize them as described in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until healed;
and if the rectum cannot protrude, give the patient a biting and harsh enema to cleanse what is in the rectum, so that it can come out clearly; When the patient strains, and if the threads are far from the anus, then the treatment is easy;
When the patient strains, and if the threads are far from the anus, then the treatment is easy; and you take them with your fingernail or with tweezers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until healed, and so they avoid the incision by iron. You must administer the suture in this manner:
You must administer the suture in this manner: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread over and make the needle pierce the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and it should be wide;
and tighten the thread firmly, then knot the thread, and pull out the needle, and do this with all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood;
then put on the wound a cloth moistened with rose oil or cerate, and put it on the wound, and tell the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, then treat them with ointment and other treatments, until they are healed.
of the drying of the excrement or anus/rectum Many times drying of the excrement occurs in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. So you must scrape the bark from the surface with the tip of a spatula or your fingernail, which prevents it from moistening; then treat it until it is consolidated as it should be;
and if it cannot consolidate, then repeat the scraping more forcefully than before, until it heals well, and is excoriated/raw; then treat it until it is healed.
of ash tree Formice is a small, misshapen/irregular appearance around the body, and it goes very deep;
and sometimes the cold finds it, and it feels as if numb with cold, and it occurs all over the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place this quill upon the formice, so that the circle encompasses the formice all around; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the formice, and put it in deep, and pull out the formice by its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a quill made of brass or iron according to this shape, and it should be thin underneath and sharp on top: not sharp enough to pierce, so that it can be held by the finger, and also pressed.
And if you wish, cauterize the formice, as described earlier in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or tin, or cast or hammered brass;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, depending on to whom they are administered. Those then which are administered in the treatment of children, and who are weak and suffering, are small.
Those then which are administered in the treatment of children, and who are weak and suffering, are small. The form of the clyster, small and large, is wider at the top, where the belly is tied, in this way:
and there should be a separation where the belly is tied, as you see, and the bottom should be pierced;
and it has two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and the belly, where the medicines are put, should be made of an animal bladder or parchment, and pierced all around with small holes, and there should be a finger's width between each hole, then put a strong thread of raw flax, twisted tenfold or around it into these holes, and gather the belly like a goat's udder; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument at the front with a strong thread, then administer the clyster;
and this is the shape of the circle:
And the medicine should be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the tip of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the practitioner squeezes it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then withdraws the clyster, and the patient raises their legs against the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, they hold it in as long as they can; and if they sleep a whole night with it, it is even more helpful.
And if you give a clyster for diarrhea, and the medicine comes out quickly, repeat it until they are healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or an abscess, the clyster should be as thin as for a child;
and this is the form of the thin clyster for when the leather is tight:
We have already spoken in the division about the treatment of wounds;
now we will tell you the treatments by hand and by medicine, according to completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and from what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing stones, and cutting with a sword and knife, or with a lance or wood or arrow, or similar things;
or that they are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the treatment for each wound, and will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the complex one will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head, and the bone is not broken, take note if it is from a thrown stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you suspect the development of a hot abscess: then immediately have them bleed from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side of the injured part;
and the patient should avoid excess of wine and rich foods.
And if they do not want to be bled, then let their food be light, and let them not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if a hot abscess develops there, cotton soaked only in rose oil, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood and has not been exposed to the air, a powder, which I will describe a little later;
and if the burn has altered it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together by tents, then join them by stitching, as I will describe for wounds of the belly, concerning stitching.
If the wound exposes bone and hangs, attached only slightly, cut it off; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat rich foods, such as head cheese and cooked wheat, also like chicken, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut away all the rot, and throw it away, then treat it;
And if there is an artery or vein in the wound from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped with medicines, then search for the artery, and if you find it displaced, tie it with a thread; and if that doesn't work, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and put in this powder which heals before the burn changes it.
And the composition of the powder is: take one part incense; two parts dragon's blood; three parts quicklime, and powder it finely, and fill the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then tie it well, and leave it unbound unless it swells; for the medicine is not removed until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with lime alone, when one does not have the incense or the dragon's blood, but the burn must not have changed the wound.
And if the burn has changed the wound, especially in summer, then this powder is not applied;
but apply some digestive ointments, or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey, until it suppurates; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture comes with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine forceps;
and I will tell you later about fractures of the head.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other method than to leave it to heal, and not put anything restrictive on it, because it harms the nerves and makes them retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their connection is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but the medicine should be soft, such as warm water washed in fresh water, and mixed with rose oil, and cuckoo pint also washed in fresh water, and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, then sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is filled with pus and mud, then pierce it in the lowest place;
And if the artery is cut, and bleeding occurs, then uncover it, and wash it, and cauterize it if necessary;
And if the windpipe of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the tube is preserved, through which the food passes, then sew the heart over the tube of the throat, and do not touch the throat but put it back according to its natural shape; And then bind it conveniently, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
And if the wound has made an impression in the bone, then scrape it; And if there are pieces of bone, then pull them all out if you can, and those that you cannot get, leave them until the wound festers, and is opened and the passage cleared;
And if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, then treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a blow from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, then see if air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put the powder in it at the first hour, nor bind it because of the blood so that it does not remain deep inside and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but put on a drawing ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; thus no spasm will come, nor trembling sickness of the heart, nor shortness of breath; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is safe. Then treat it with tents and other treatments until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, then know that there is a fistula;
so treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword cut or knife, and it is simple, whether on the chest or the back, treat it as described previously; if it is large, with sutures;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is pressed into the bone, and has broken off pieces, then explore the wound, and draw them out if they are detached; and if they are not detached, let the wound fester, so the extraction will be easier;
and the judgment for other wounds in other limbs is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly/abdomen
The rupture of the belly/abdomen is large and medium and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestine, or the sinews of the intestines, protrude, making their insertion difficult;
and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in unless one replaces them promptly;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, thus making them more difficult to replace, and therefore the medium wound is better, because the intestine is more easily returned to its place than in the other two.
And know that the rupture of the abdomen/belly occurs in four ways:
the two common sutures occur in the suturing of the abdomen/belly, and the suturing of other wounds of the body and two other specific sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more specific with the suturing of the abdomen/belly, and I will describe and explain each one.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put back, this is because of one of the two ways: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this way: wet a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or in which you cook squinant, cypress, and spikenard in water, and sprinkle the intestine until the swelling is gone;
and sometimes make this wine astringent, and it is better than plain water for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling subside, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow and mallow have been cooked, for by this the opening is soothed a little;
and if it cannot enter, then cut the wound a little with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, for no one should cut there unless there is great necessity;
and this is the instrument for cutting it:
cut inside the curve and not outside, and see here the shape: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, put it back according to its natural form in its proper place, if you are able, for that is much better.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, you must make the patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly, put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, take care that the injured part is higher than the other;
and thus one must manage what I say for large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, apply what is prepared for you, then have at hand a compassionate assistant who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common method of stitching, and it is that you take a needle or several, depending on the width of the wound, then leave a finger's width of space from the top of the wound, and insert a needle there with a good strong thread; and pierce both edges of the skin along with both edges of the siphac, which is under the skin inside, until you make it pierce through to the other side, and bring the two edges of the siphac, all four together;
then tie it with a double thread around the needle on both sides, then bring the two edges of the wound together neatly, then leave a finger's width of space, and insert another needle there;
then tie it with the thread as you did the first needle, and continue doing this according to how many needles you need, until the entire wound is closed;
and the needles should be medium, between fine and thick, because fine needles cut through all the flesh, and those that are too thick cannot enter well: therefore they must be medium-sized;
and the needles should not be placed too deep in the flesh and skin, so that they don't cut and open the wound before it heals;
and then cut off the heads of the needles, so they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and place tents or cloths at the ends of the needles to hold them still, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles are sufficient.
The second stitch is common, and is that you bring the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the muscle together with a needle threaded with a strong, medium-sized thread;
and when you have pierced all four of these edges together, bring the needle back to the side where you began, in the way that cloth is sewn;
and leave a space between each stitch the width of a little finger;
this stitch is common knowledge, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, who was wounded with a knife, and the wound was more than a handspan long, and his intestines were protruding a good two handspans, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I put his intestines back in after they had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was stitched up within fifteen days, and I treated him, and he was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and it was a miracle;
and I did not treat him with ointment, for I was in a place where none could be found, nor any medicines; and I simply put old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper ways of stitching:
take the needle, and push it from the outside part to the inside;
when it has pierced the center straight through, then take the end of the thread or suture where you pushed the needle, and make it pierce on the other side from inside to outside;
and the meaning of this stitch is that you sew as leatherworkers do hides, and that you leave the thread once on one side, and take it again on the other, until the stitching is complete.
The second way of stitching, which Galen specifically describes, is like some do, who bring the two parts together naturally, and join one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the end of the wound nearby, and make it pierce only that spot, and leave the two ends of the thread; then turn the needle and make it pierce from the outside to the inside, at the two ends of the thread;
then make it pierce both from the outside to the inside, at two other ends of the wound that are on the other side;
and this is the best way of stitching and the most common.
Galen said these words, and some testify to it, that one should sew the belly with two needles, where there is thread in each one;
and one should push one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew leather straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The treatment of the wound is like the treatment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the air has changed it, so replace the intestine, and sew it;
then put on the powder generating flesh, and if the air has changed it, then put on some ointment that is available, until the wound swells; and one hundred threads, and the superficial tissues should be joined, and the peritoneum; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you have no medicines, so put on, as soon as it begins to swell, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicine in most cases when the wounds are simple;
and if you are worried that the wound will spread to the principal members, then you must soak light wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and place it around the groin, and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or pus in the bowels, and it often happens, then give enemas of lukewarm dark wine, especially if the pus comes down to the intestine;
and it pierces within, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded, and this is because of the arrangement of the veins that are there, and because of the delicateness of the whole body, and the closeness of its nature to the nerves.
And if the omentum protrudes from the wound, put it back in just like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, you must tie off the place that is black, so that bleeding does not occur there, because there are veins and arteries;
then cut what is between the two ligatures, and let the two ends hang from the part below the wound down outside to ease the extraction when the omentum falls off, and the wound closes.
of the rupture of the scrotum
When the intestine is round, and the wound is small, it can be repaired in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and it festered and became a fistula, and the excrement and gas came out of it;
I treated it as best I could, and did not stop refining the treatment until he was healed, and the place closed.
And when I saw it closed, I feared that the patient would have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, that it must be tied up in this manner: Take wheat grains with large heads, then bring the lips of the wound together, and when the wheat grain has opened its mouth, place it on the two lips so that it tightens its mouth over them;
and then cut off the head, and it holds so that it cannot come undone, then put another wheat grain next to it in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely enclosed; and sew the wound.
These heads then dry up in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread that is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
take the end of this intestinal thread that is very thin, and then tie a thin twisted linen thread to the end of this thread, then put the thread in the needle, and sew the intestine with it, and bring it back into the rupture;
and this method of stitching with wheat grains is only according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy or healing, except subtlety.
of a fistula wherever it may be Know that any wound or abscess, when it becomes chronic, is universally called a "fistula", and especially when it is deep and produces pus.
And a fistula, in truth, is a false, hard, white knot, where there is no feeling of pain, and is as deep as the feather of a bird;
and sometimes it discharges clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes little, and other times a lot;
and I have already spoken of it in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and where there is no flesh, is only due to one of nine causes: namely, because of lack of blood or bodily strength; or because of its malignancy; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, which prevents new flesh from growing; or there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of poor quality; or the medicine is not good for the treatment; or because the infection is like a pestilence; or because of the characteristics of the region, digestion is slow, and healing is slow, and it swells naturally; or there are veins or bones there:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the medical treatments in the division.
Now I must inform you about the treatment of a fistula that is made by hand. (surgically created)
Know that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that occur in the large veins, and in the arteries, and in the nerves, or in the peritoneum, or in the intestine, or in the bladder, or in some of the ribs, or in the spine of the back, or in any joint of the hands or feet; and there are some that occur in the principal member itself, and in similar places.
And all fistulas of this kind are difficult to heal, and there is nothing but work and ignorance (involved in treating them);
and if there is a fistula that does not reach the place that I have mentioned, and you are confident in the treatment, and you want to examine it, then take a probe of brass or iron, if the fistula is straight, and explore it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a thin lead probe, for lead bends easily around the crookedness;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot probe it well, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture will run from one opening to another and cleanse it;
then explore it carefully as best you can, so that you know if there is bone or nerve involved, and its depth, and ask the patient carefully about the pain he feels from the pressure of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the location where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove entirely the corrupted matter and flesh that are within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep in a straight line, then you must cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in tents soaked in a sharp medicine, and push them right to the end of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then put in ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not hinder you in the principal members, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then scrape it until the corruption is all removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns to pus as before, know that you have not gone deep enough:
so uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, that is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; so there is no other solution than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it with forceps, extract it with a suitable instrument, and if there are many bones, pull them all out, do not leave a single one;
and if the moisture hinders you, and there is no error or fear, cut both moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, apply something generating rot to the wound, and leave it until the place is rotted around the bones, and then they will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, like from the leg or thigh, only remove the corruption until all the blackness is gone, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; it must be scraped and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treated until it is healed;
and I will tell you about a fistula that occurred in a man's leg, so that you may take example and assistance in your work.
There was a young man around 30 years old, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that originated within the body, so that the matter went to the leg, and it swelled with a large abscess, and there was no reason to use cautery to open it;
but the physicians, through their foolishness, worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed from it, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared there that all released pus and fluid from the body;
and many physicians applied treatment to it for about two years, and none were skilled in the art of surgery, until I was called there, and saw his leg and the medicines with which it was being treated, and what flowed from the holes in large quantity; and the young man's body became red, and he had a jaundiced complexion.
I inserted a tent into one of these holes, and then probed all the holes, and found that they all connected to each other from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted and perforated, and the corruption went down to the bone inside;
I scraped away what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought there was no other corruption besides what I removed;
and I began to treat the wound with cleansing medicines for a long time, and it would not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing in the bone, and I scraped it, and then removed it, and I tried to heal the place; but I could not until I cut around a handspan of bone, and pulled it out completely bare, then treated it with medicines; and it was quickly healed and closed, and there was no need to begin the work again except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure it, and for the fear of death I had for him. For because of the bloodletting he often sobbed, but he was completely healed, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good quality and he had no harm or discomfort whatsoever, neither in going nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be treated in this manner: Take a linen cloth and tie it to the end of the exposed bone, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and put another woolen tie, thicker than the first, and tie it over the flesh that is above the bone, and pull on the end, so that you draw the damaged flesh underneath, and uncover the flesh on the area where you want to treat, so that the silk does not injure the flesh;
and put a firebrand or a board under the bone so that you can easily cut the damaged flesh;
and it should be treated as long as one can see and feel the infection, and treated again another time.
And if the bone is infected, and it is not visible, and the infection is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a firebrand underneath, and then treat with silk from one side of the infection to the other, and the silk should be a bit longer than the infection, as we have said;
and if the infection is in the joint, then cut the infected joint, and treat the bone where it connects to the other part;
and if the infection is in the connection of the two joints, then there is no other solution than to cut;
and if the infection is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, then this is very difficult, but nevertheless you must investigate this corrosion, as it appears to you; and clean it in all the ways that you can, but so that the veins or the nerves do not cause you difficulty;
and know that the cutting instruments and the saws for cutting these bones are many, depending on the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and thinness, and their size, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument for each type of work;
and know that the work itself will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the types of illnesses; so consider the instrument you need according to what is required.
The head can rot either from an internal cause, or from an external cause;
and when you have treated this decay with medicinal remedies, and they are not effective, then it is necessary to cut off the limb up to the place where the decay reaches, so that the patient escapes death thereby, or by the greater misfortune, the loss of the limb;
and the sign is that the limb becomes black, so that it seems to be burnt by fire, and rots after the blackness, then this decay spreads from limb to limb, and takes over the whole body;
so hasten to cut it off, and if it is from the bite of some venomous beast, like a sea scorpion, viper, or similar, if the decay is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to reach the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it off at the joint, so that the decay does not reach the arm;
and if it reaches the arm, cut it off at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is fatal, and no treatment is effective except the extent of its power; (referring to the poison's power)
and do the same when the decay occurs in the foot: if it reaches the first joint, cut it off after the next joint;
and if it reaches the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it rises into the leg, amputate at the knee joint;
and if it goes above the knee, there is no other option but to leave the patient to die;
and the way to cut or saw the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant stretches one of the ties downwards, and another assistant the other tie upwards, and you separate the flesh which is between the two ties with a spatula's width, until the bone is exposed;
then cut or saw it, and place a linen cloth on each side, so that the saw does not touch the healthy part, and cause the patient further injury and a hot abscess.
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some astringent powders;
then return to your treatment until it is completed, then tie the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you what happened to a man in his foot:
he developed a blackness that looked like a burn, and this corrosion started in his toe, until it took over the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hurried to cut off the foot, and was healed;
and a long time later the corrosion returned in a finger of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repelling medications after cleansing the body, and the corrosion could not be stopped;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I refused, because I had hope of driving back the matter; and I also feared that if I cut off his hand, he would die, because the man's constitution was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have only related this so that one may do the same, if there is need.
Sometimes an abscess arises in a fleshy place, and remains so long that it creates a large collection of pus; and then it breaks and bursts, and the pus spurts out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin that is over it is as thin as a delicate cloth, and it does not run down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such a condition is called a "sinus," and it is not called a "fistula";
but if it is so elongated that it reaches down to the bone deeply, it is called a "fistula";
and the treatment is that you cut this skin all around, especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it will not heal because of its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with an enema like this:
observe if the breast is large, and the pus that comes out has a foul odor, then administer an Egyptian medicine enema which is made like this: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, in equal parts, and put them to cook in a vessel over fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take some of this according to your need, and mix it with water and honey, and inject it into the breast with an enema, and constrict the opening; and leave the medicine inside for two hours, then extract it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the breast is cleansed, and the pus is removed;
and sometimes it is cleansed with ash water, when this medicine is not available, and you should take ashes from vine wood, and pour water over them, then strain it, and inject it with an enema, until you know that the breast is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then cleanse it with water and honey in which a little litharge has been ground; or you cleanse it with mixed honey and wine, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine helps dry the breast;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the breast is well cleansed, then cleanse it with that which generates flesh in it, and you should take diachylon plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you cleanse it with some medicines and ointments, whose properties I have described in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the breast is small, and the tube of the syringe cannot enter, then widen it a little with an iron instrument, and insert a tent of the Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too large, then sew it up and leave only one place where the syringe can enter, and if the opening that drains pus is at the top, make it in the lowest place.
and if you cannot cut the breast from below as you wish, then arrange it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest place, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to regenerate, and if you cannot cut the breast from below as you wish, arrange it in this way: so that the pus flows easily downwards, and do not leave any of the pus there;
so that the pus flows easily downwards, and do not leave any of the pus there; and take consolidative medicines to put on the breast, and spread over it a linen cloth that covers the entire breast; then cut forcefully around the opening of the breast a little larger than the first, then spread a soothing ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the opening of the breast to draw out the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days, once;
and the one that is over the opening of the breast, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, whether it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take care if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this way and you see the nature that jumps/pushes on the opening of the breast, then know that the breast is healing, and health is approaching;
and then unbind it in the morning, or the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if thin venom flows after a long time, do not despair of healing, for health is approaching.
For there are people whose flesh is slow to regenerate in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus comes out of the breast after many days, know that the breast will not heal;
and if the breast is slow to heal, and it is prolonged, add medicines that are moist in substance and dry in virtue, like diachylon ointment, for it contains a large amount of vitriol, and that is the last medicine;
take diachylon ointment, and make it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with old wine equal in substance;
then preserve it and use it;
and this same thing does better cooked thickened, when diachylon ointment is not available, or you take myrrh and aloe and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey when it is on the fire;
and then spread it on a cloth, and spread it over the breast, and sometimes administer long birthwort, and roots of celestial lily, which is like vetch flour and centaury; and use it simple or compound: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey I mentioned, and use it;
and if the treatment is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard members, or on the ligaments; then treat it for a fistula, as we have said before.
A panaritium is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb, or of the foot, or perhaps arises in other fingers;
and when it is old, and one does not take care of it, a hot abscess arises there, and runs and throws off pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and sometimes runs through it all;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, so that there is a foul-smelling pain, and the end of the finger is swollen, and the color is dark.
When you treat it as we have described in the section, and the treatment is not effective, then you must cut away with a knife all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterward. Cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses into the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, then you must place a thread under the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and apply burning and corrosive medicines on the remaining flesh to remove it all; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corrosion is in the bone, then cut it and extract it out, for as long as the corrupted bone remains, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger becoming corrupted, then cut it at one of the joints as described previously, then treat it until it is healed;
And if it is struck and bruised and there is great pain, then you must first bleed it;
then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across the top, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, then apply something soothing.
The extra finger which grows on the hands of some men by chance is entirely fleshy, and sometimes there are some where there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow at the base of the joint, where the growth is on certain parts of the fingers.
The one that grows on some part of the finger does not move, and the one that grows at the joint of the finger, by chance moves;
The removal of the one that is fleshy is easy, in this way: Cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
The one that grows at the base of the joint is difficult to treat: so refrain from cutting it.
In the one that grows in the finger at the last joint, you must first cut the flesh roundly down to the bone, then cut the bone with a saw suitable for this, then treat it until it is healed.
The fusion that occurs in the fingers together comes by birth, or by the healing of a wound, or by a burn from fire, or by similar things.
You must cut this fusion, so that the fingers return to their natural shapes; then put between the two spaces tents or cloths soaked in rose oil, so they don't fuse back together; or you put between the two thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is necessary.
If fusion occurs in any of his fingers with the palm, cut this fusion as needed.
Worms are large convoluted veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in several parts of the body;
and occurs more in the legs of those who walk and who work and carry things, than in others.
It is therefore necessary that you sometimes administer a purgative of bile, and then heal it with basil.
The iron cure is done in two ways: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; and the other way is that you lift the vein, and pull it all the way out.
The cut is made in this way: first bathe the leg with very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then tighten the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or in two or in three, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then tie it off, and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The raising of it is in this manner: Raise the patient's leg, if there is a lot of hair, then put it in the bath, and sprinkle the leg with hot water until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you don't have a bath, warm it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the thigh to the top of the knee, or in the lower part at the ankle;
then open the skin with the hook, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when you feel it;
and it appears red and black, and when it enters the skin it looks like a white cord;
then push the thread underneath, until it is lifted from the skin, and then hang it on the hook gently, then cut it in another place about three fingers above;
then scrape the skin above the vein until it appears, then lift it with the thread, as you did before, and hang it on another hook, as you did the first time;
then make another cut, or several if you need them, then lift it and cut it with your toe, then pull and lift it up to the second cut;
then pull it from cut to cut, until it comes out completely, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and put a thread underneath, and turn your hand from side to side, until it comes out; and be careful not to cut it, because if it is cut, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and it will harm the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the penis is contracted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it carefully, but do not cut it; and pull it as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which the penis is cut is curved, and does not cut, so that it does not cut the vein;
and it has a large curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the shape:
This vein appears on legs, in hot areas where neither grass nor trees grow, and in land without moisture;
and sometimes it appears elsewhere than on the legs, and this happens from the putrefaction that comes under the skin, as it occurs inside the body with snakes and worms, generated between skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a very large inflammation appears on the leg, then the location changes, and the vein begins to protrude, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead weighing from one and a half to two drams, and tie it, and let the lead hang from the leg, and each time it protrudes more when cauterizing, wrap it around the lead, and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it is completely removed; for if you cut it, it will go back into the flesh, and cause an abscess and putrefaction in the area, and a serious illness;
therefore it must be pulled little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body;
and this vein is sometimes when pulled five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, insert a probe into the hole, and pierce it all the way through, so that it all comes out;
and the matter within should be emptied, and apply medicines generating pus to the area for a few days, then treat it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has several branches, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many holes appear there, from which branches emerge;
then treat it as we have said before.
of worms that are born between skin and flesh This disease is called in our land "ox disease," because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm that arises between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the whole body ascending and descending, and one feels it well as it moves from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and jumps out;
and it is generated from the corruption of certain humors, as worms and snakes and earthworms and ascarides arise in the belly;
and one fears its malice, for when it travels through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, perhaps it enters and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you wish to treat it and extract it, you can only do so when it moves:
therefore, you must tie the area above and below with a strong ligature very tightly, then cut into it and pull it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it, cauterize it with fire on top, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does is that it infects the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, squeeze the eyebrow tightly below it, then cut into it and pull it out;
and the patient must use body cleansing with laxative medicines for the bad putrid humors, and abstain from foods generating rot.
of the pain that comes from flatulence This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and it is a pain that arises in certain limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and shortly after, I saw it rise like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from place to place;
the pain left that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran throughout the body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it constantly moved around the body, as I saw it.
I marveled greatly how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this way. However, I had often seen that pain could move from place to place, but I had not seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that this was because the woman had a dry body, and uncovered veins, and because of this, this constrained flatulence appeared;
and it does not appear in this way in those who are soft/delicate, and who have moist bodies and hidden veins.
And when you want to treat this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then quickly tie it above and below, and then cut into it so that this constrained flatulence at that place can come out; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your own eyes, treat it with something that expels flatulence, like fetid pills, and pills of serapin, and other similar things.
Arrows/arrowheads are diverse, according to their appearance and according to the places of the body where they fall.
Their diversity is such that there are some that have large points, and small, and barbed, and solid/unbarbed; and some that have two barbs, and some that have tongues/blades, and some that are in pieces;
and one that falls into any limb falls in two ways: either it falls into a principal member, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members/organs. When it falls then into any of these places/organs, and the signs of death, which I will tell you hereafter, appear: then you must refrain from extracting this arrow, for death follows in many forms/cases; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not embedded deeply, then draw it out, and treat the wound.
And the sign of the brain when the arrow falls there and pierces the bone, and the dura mater, which is over the brain, bursts out, is when there is dizziness and stupor and vertigo and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood comes out of the nostrils, or the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and from the wound comes a white moisture resembling pus, and also something like burnt flesh comes out;
and if these signs appear to you, abstain from treatment, and pull out the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart, are that it is near the left nipple, and feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not hollow; and sometimes the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows, and coldness comes with a cold sweat, and fainting: know then without a doubt that death is coming.
And the sign of an arrow that injures the lung is that blood mixed with froth comes from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow falls into the covering of the chest, it is near the small ribs; and causes great difficulty breathing, great pain and sighing; and all the limbs from the shoulders down twitch/tremble.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, perhaps some undigested food will come out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the belly, and some excrement comes out of the wound through a ruptured intestine, there is no hope in the treatment, nor in extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out of the wound, and the patient feels severe pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, armpits, spine, ribs, thighs, legs, and similar parts, are safe according to various factors. When the arrow is in a nerve or artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and drew it out on the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I pulled out, as a game, an arrow that had fallen into the fat of the eye, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was lodged, and I could only reach the tip towards the shaft, and the arrow was a large one from a Turkish bow, with a light, smooth iron head without barbs;
the eye was healed, and no ill effects occurred.
And I pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and it was an Arabian arrow with barbs:
I filed down the barbs, and worked carefully until I pulled it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I removed an arrow from a man, that had fallen into his belly, and I thought he would die;
and after thirty days had passed, his condition did not change; I cut down upon the arrow, and manipulated it, and pulled it out, and there were no ill effects.
And I also saw a man who had an arrow fall into his back, and the wound closed over it;
and the arrow remained inside him, and he did not change his natural habits, nor did he find harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, who had an arrow fall into his face, and the wound closed; and it remained thus without causing him great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And I extracted an arrow from one of the king's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and was slightly inclined to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it three days after it had fallen. I found the wound very narrow.
I searched for it with a very fine probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the arrowhead. I applied an attractive and digestive plaster to the area, so that the place would not swell; and the location of the arrow appeared to me.
and the location of the arrow appeared to me. I put the plaster there for several days, and the wound healed over again, and the patient remained like this for a long time, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose;
and he told me. I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for several days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow, which was stuck in place;
then I added more of that sharp medicine into the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrow became clearly visible to me;
and the time period certainly exceeded four months, and then the wound widened enough so that I inserted the forceps, and moved it back and forth, but it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise different kinds of instruments, until one day I grasped it with well-made forceps, according to the form that will appear at the end of this chapter, until I pulled it out, and healed the wound.
And physicians believe that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: then I restored it, and the wound was sutured, and the patient was completely healed.
Now I have told you about the nature of extracting some arrows, so you should apply your care to that which I have not mentioned, because the book cannot include everything;
but the wise master understands much from little, and based on what is present and lacking, finds new work, and new instruments, for the removal of strange things that occur in this art.
I say that arrows do not emerge from the limbs where they are embedded except in two ways: either through the place where they entered, or through another part;
and the one that comes out through where it entered is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes comes out immediately.
And if it does not come out immediately, leave it until the flesh around it rots, and the exit is widened;
and also if it is embedded in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it like that for some days, and move it every day;
and then it will come out, and if it does not, then pierce around it entirely with a thin drill, until the place around it is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged in a place on the body where it cannot be seen, then search for it with the probe; and if you feel it, then pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the narrowness of the wound, and because of the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone or nerve or vein there, then enlarge the wound until it is large enough;
and pull the arrow out if you can, and if the arrow has barbs which are holding it in, then remove the flesh which is pierced on both sides as best you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, so that you can pull it out;
and take care not to break the arrow, as you would have more difficulty removing it.
And if you cannot do it at once, leave it until the place around it is putrid, then pull it out, because the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we have said about the treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting a nerve or a vein, and strive how you can best remove the arrow without danger, either quickly or slowly, firmly or gently;
and position the patient in the same way he was when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then place him according to what the signs indicate.
An arrow that comes out from another part, where any part of it is visible, or the skin is swollen around it so that it can be clearly seen or felt:
then cut into it, until the forceps can grasp it, and then extract it: if it jumps out immediately.
And if it is stuck in the bone, then rotate your hand circularly, until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it again, and then recommence the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, push it out with the entire shaft;
and if the shaft falls, and you want to administer pushing, then apply a threaded instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the threading of the instrument;
and then push it out, and if the arrow is barbed, push in a pointed instrument, to facilitate the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut away all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as appropriate.
And if the arrow falls into the chest, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and it is close, and you can cut down to it, then cut;
and be careful not to cut the vein or the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which one draws out arrows are similar to a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing instrument is like the feather of a bird, to push against the tip of the arrow, as is the shape here:
There are 31 veins from which one bleeds, of which 16 are in the head, namely: Two pulsating veins which are behind the ears, which are called the two "arteries behind the ear"; and the two arteries which are visible in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "corner veins"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein which is at the tip of the nose; and the two jugular veins that are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the upper lips of the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; (possibly referring to the superior labial veins) and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and it is on the left side, and the lay people call it the "head vein"; and the middle one is called "faste," and it is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it the "heart vein"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it the "belly vein", and it is above the elbow, and it is the one from which one bleeds, which appears clearly on the wrist.
And the salvatella is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is below the curve of the wrist on the left side, and the second, the saphenous, which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nesse," which is on the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg there are three veins below these.
Bleeding the veins that are behind the ears helps with chronic catarrh and migraines;
and the way to bleed them, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then have the patient tighten their neck by screwing their head, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging from the head: then search for them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed with a lancet;
then take the lancet, and push it under the vein down to the bone, then lift your hand with the vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well the width of two fingers, and let out as much blood as you see fit;
then bandage and tie it until it is healed;
and I have already discussed incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding the two arteries that are in the two temples is beneficial for chronic and sudden migraines, and habitual ophthalmia, and for a burning sensation of sharp tears in the eyes;
and the method of bleeding is as I say: and it is that the patient strains his neck until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed with a lancet;
then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done with the two other veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then untie the patient, and put your finger over the vein for an hour, then apply cotton; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of them and of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for long-standing illnesses of the face, and for migraines, and for redness;
and the procedure is that the patient strains his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called "digger," of which here is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and strike upon it with your hand, or with something else, and let the blood flow out according to the quantity you desire; then release the patient's neck, and tie off the vein until it is healed, and sometimes it is opened with a broad lancet.
However, it is not necessary that the lancet be too sharp; and cut across it, because the bone is near, and perhaps the lancet breaks when it is thin.
Bleeding the two veins that are in the two tear ducts helps the eyes, and against ringworm, and redness, and sty in the eye, and diseases of the face;
and the manner of bleeding them is that the patient strains his neck by twisting with some bandage, as before;
then bleed him, and let the incision be across, a little along the lancet a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the lancet is thin, perhaps it will break;
then let the blood flow as much as you need, and then apply cotton on it, and tie it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for acute illness, and sudden madness, and diseases of the face, such as migraine and redness that comes to the face, and especially when it is chronic;
and the way to perform the bleeding is that the patient tightens his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take the thin long lancet, and insert it in the middle of the lip in the space that is between the two nostrils, because the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then tie it up for a night, because it is very quickly restored;
Bleeding from the two tonsils helps with shortness of breath, and the onset of leprosy, and many illnesses, and impetigo, and corrosive ulcers, and herpes, and malignant ulcers;
and the way to perform the bleeding is that the patient stretches his neck below both, as we have said;
and let the practitioner stand above the patient's head, and let the patient sit on a seat, then bleed the vein lengthwise a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
then do the same in the other vein, then untie the ligature, and compress both veins moderately, so that the patient does not choke; and leave it until morning, so that the wound is healed.
of the bleeding of the lips Bleeding the upper lip veins helps with glue in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and cracked lips, and the nose and around it.
And the way to perform the bleeding is to have the patient sit in front of you, and compress his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognizable because they are black, and because around them are small black veins:
then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, cut the largest one on each side, and do the same for the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
of the bleeding under the tongue Bleeding the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding the cephalic vein, and this is for tightening of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the proper way to bleed is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and lifts their tongue, and you look underneath on each side for a black vein:
bleed then one and the other, and do not go too deep, because underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the neck that are commonly bled are bled in two ways:
either by pricking with a myrtle-leaf-shaped lancet, broad, or a subtle olive-shaped one like cutting edges, and it is called "anesil"; and they are broad and narrow according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The myrtle leaf shape is very renowned, and is broad as you see:
And it is needed for opening hairy veins full of visible thick blood, and that contain thick and turbid blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped lancet:
and it is more finely pointed, and it is for bleeding thin veins, where there is thin, clear blood.
Bleeding from the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and the bloodletter must bleed wisely, and beware of the artery that is beneath. And if he cuts the artery, and bleeding occurs, then it must be stopped, as I have said; and the blade should not be piercing, but cutting like a lancet.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then you must compress it, and choose another; or you look for a branch of it, or you bleed from the vein in the middle of the arm instead: it is clearly visible; and make the incision with the lancet blade, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place for the bloodletting, you must first, before tightening the arm, touch the area until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the lancet blade; and be careful not to strike the artery when you see the place swollen, for that is the artery: then wipe it.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: hurry then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; then bind the arm, and leave it like that, and let the patient not move it;
and let him be careful, and not move it until he is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and the medicine is not at hand, then cut the artery if it is visible, for the ends will retract; and the blood will stop.
And take a rind of green stick, and split it, and take one of the halves and tie it on firmly until the next day;
if the blood stops, that is good; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and stopping the bleeding is not difficult in most cases because of the small size of the wound, and the strength of the arm's ligature.
The median vein bleeding in the middle is helpful as it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and the bloodletter must be cautious of the nerve that is underneath, and if he punctures too deep, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and healing is difficult, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve is apparent many times, and if it is not apparent in some men due to its thinness, then you must bleed it with a lancet instrument; and avoid the nerve as much as possible.
And if there is a vein between two nerves, then open it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein is helpful, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and one should bleed by puncturing at the site of the olive leaf or the myrtle leaf, because it is the safest of all the veins, for there is neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, one should seek the easiest location, and it doesn't matter if one misses the first time, and starts again; and perhaps the area swells in some people, when one misses the first time, but it doesn't matter.
The amount of bloodletting depends on your judgment.
The first thing you must know about bloodletting is that it is administered only to maintain health, and to avoid future illnesses;
and the bloodletting should be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow: that is to say, cephalic, median cubital, and basilic; and one should be bled at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of plethora appear;
and one should be bled on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
Bloodletting that is administered for illnesses has no fixed time, but rather when there is need, day or night, at all hours and at all times;
and one should not bleed children until fourteen years old, nor pregnant women except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor should the elderly who are past sixty years old be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, they should cleanse the intestines with a light enema, if they have much retained stool, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed someone who is overly satiated with food, nor who is drunk, until they are recovered, nor the dropsical;
and one should beware of bleeding after colic, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and frequent sexual intercourse with a woman, and from exertion, from staying awake, and from fasting, and that which weakens all strength, whether by something of the mind or of the body;
then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, through foods and drinks and through medicines, if you have the means;
then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and be bled from the vein of the chest around the third hour, as we have said;
and on that day, guard yourself from exertion, and from difficulty, and from sexual activity, and from similar things;
and be happy and joyful, and let the bloodletter be higher than the one being bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature moderately tight, because when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the area with the hands, until the veins swell, and they can be felt;
then the bloodletter moistens the lancet with a little old oil, then puts a finger of his left hand on that vein a bit below the place where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail upon being lanced.
For there are veins that flee like cords when being bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when one places the lancet upon them, it withdraws the lancet and the vein cannot be opened, and thus it is with these; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bloodletter must be knowledgeable in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; if not, then start again a little below that place or quickly above, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, let him be for a day or two, and do not bind the arm: perhaps hot abscesses will develop there;
do not enter the bath, then resume the bleeding if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly and you doubt that not enough blood will come out as you wish, then strike in that same opening with the entire blade directly;
and work a little hastily, before the place swells; for this often happens, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not restart the bleeding, and put on a little oil lees, for it lightens the body of blood, and the lees are better in this place than the oil;
and thus administer the oil lees in every bleeding that you bleed from the veins, to staunch the flow of blood;
and theriac does the same, and ox dung, when it is put on the place; thus the blood thins and spreads when it is too thick.
And if there comes a large abscess, which happens often, especially when it is not bled except at the time when the opening of the vein is small, then hurry, and put on the place a sponge moistened in slightly warm water and salt, and squeeze it for an hour;
and you must do this after the blood has flowed from the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains at the place after a few days, it does not harm it; and if you wish, put on something of aloes or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, mountain mint, or similar.
And often an abscess and swelling appear at the opening of the basilic vein:
then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft under the pressure of the hand, this swelling is bad. Be careful then that you do not apply any of the things that we have mentioned, for perhaps it cuts into the artery;
but make a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with other remedies, until it is healed.
And draw blood from each finger according to the strength of its vein, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, a larger wound should be made, and the lancet should be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should be bled little and often, and he should be bled by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this method of bleeding is safe from excessive bleeding and severing a nerve, and is better than bleeding along the length or width.
And to one whose body fails during bleeding, give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is feverish, then draw blood three or four times. And if he is of a cold complexion, have him eat before bleeding bread soaked in muscat syrup, or in honey syrup flavored with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a fragrant syrup.
And if he faints during bleeding, after the loss of much blood, he should drink meat broth, and a fine, fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have mentioned in the section or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of a vein.
And if he wants to air out his arm and bleed again, he should, when he is weakened by extensive bleeding, bleed little by little, according to the extent of his strength, continuously.
And whoever wishes to air out their arm after the first bleeding, and has a strong constitution, let them bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to be bled from another location, should be bled on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body that is already heated, and causes fever; so a large quantity must be drawn, and the opening widened until he falls into a faint; then, as you observe all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on his pulse as he bleeds, so that death does not come instead of fainting, and this happens many times, when the bloodletter is negligent;
and it is not appropriate, when you wish to untie the arm, and let the blood flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press firmly on it; nor if it is bent, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of the lancet, until the blood that is congealed at the opening of the vein comes out, and put on it a little salt dissolved in water, and press lightly on it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it, until the swelling has subsided.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, bleed it in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled instead of the vein of the head because it is well-suited.
And the manner of the bloodletting is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the vessels are red;
then it should be moderately tied, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not lengthwise nor widely;
and let the opening be wide, and be bled very near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for it is put there more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein of the right hand is good for all diseases of the liver, and this is the method:
bind the hand, and put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen, so that it can be seen; and bleed it across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is congealed in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is necessary, put oil and salt on the vein to heal it quickly, and do so for each branch.
Bleeding it in the left hand is good for diseases of the spleen, and do just as I told you on the right side.
Bleeding the saphenous vein is good for all illnesses that are below the body, such as illnesses of the marrow, and retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and of the thighs and of old legs, and similar illnesses.
And the way to bleed it is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it appears, and ties above the ankle joint; and the vein is at the ankle, and many branches go above the foot;
bleed it then in the largest branch, or at the ankle, which is better.
And if you bleed it above the foot, beware of the nerves that are below, and bleed it across as if cutting;
and let the lancet be sharp.
And if the blood cannot come out, put the foot back in the water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bloodletter misses the first time, repeat the second time a little above, because the area is safe;
do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot likewise.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the ankle outside, and its bleeding is beneficial for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the way to bleed it is that the patient enters the bath, and squeezes above the ankle four fingers' width by twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in every way you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, for the location is safe, and it is greatly renowned among many men.
and it is better that you cut it, for the location is safe, and it is greatly renowned among many men. And if you do not find it, bleed any branch of it that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and let as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the ligature, and apply cotton and tighten it; it is now healed.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or brass, or glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by lancing and drawing blood, or without lancing.
And this cupping without lancing is done in two ways: either with fire, or without fire;
and cupping done by lancing and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, one of which is right on the top of the head; and the other is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping glass under the chin; and the cupping glasses on the two shoulders; and the cupping glasses on the buttocks; and the cupping glasses in the middle of the two arms; and the cupping glasses on the two legs; and the cupping glasses on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are spread in the flesh, and therefore one does not weaken from it, as one does from bloodletting from a vein; and it should not be administered, neither with fire nor without fire, in any illness that comes from plethora, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illness cupping is required, or by habit, we administer it every time at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle, and at any time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and cough up blood; and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the nose helps with the heaviness of the head ... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of the bleeding of the cephalic vein, and it is not appropriate for those of a cold complexion to use it, or those who have catarrh, because it causes them great harm;
and therefore it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And he who is often bled becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping glass a little lower for fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the middle of the neck is in place of bleeding from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for tightness of the chest, and for cracking of the bronchial tube, and for coughs, and for congestion;
and there one should apply it lightly, because if it holds too firmly, it generates forgetfulness in the stomach and in the heart.
Cupping on the two sides of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for sore throat, and for pain in the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bleeding from the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the bleeder to loosen his hand when applying it, so that he does not cut the artery, and there is no excessive bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is good for diseases of the mouth, and for corruption of the gums, and similar illnesses that are in the mouth; and is in place of bleeding from the two lips.
Cupping on the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and plethora.
Cupping on the elbows is worth as much as from the three veins of the arm, because it draws blood from these large veins;
and instruct the bleeder not to strike too deeply, for the place is bare of flesh, and has nerves and arteries underneath.
The cupping glass that is placed on the buttocks is good for hemorrhoids of the anus, and for illnesses below, and it is necessary that the cupping glass be large, and made of brass, because it needs to draw well; and perhaps, if it were thin, it would break; and make large wounds there.
Cupping glasses on the legs bleed openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the spleen, and of the bladder, and restore menstruation;
and are placed at the location of the two saphenous veins, and the two ankles, and nevertheless they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many ways.
The way to apply the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not stop doing this until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then cauterize, and replace the cupping glasses, and take care in the disposition of the bodies, because there are some who have tender flesh and clear pores: so it is necessary to strike only once, and make wide wounds, and a little deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to thin the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we want to draw blood little by little, striking once is sufficient. And if we want a lot of blood, we start again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart be pierced suddenly, and for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, you should anoint the places of the cupping glasses with opening and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or oil of cucurbita seed;
and if it is in winter, with watercress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take marjoram oil, or balsamite oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
And if the one being treated has tender flesh and large pores, no oil should be applied, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or cucurbita water, or purslane water, or similar.
And he who has much moisture, should rinse with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities should rinse with old wine, or elderflower water, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not be treated with cupping before the bath nor in the bath, but after the bath an hour or two;
and should not sleep after cupping, and must take care when he is to be cupped and when he has been cupped.
And be wary if the one who is being treated is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat chickens, and mutton, and moist foods.
and eat chickens, and mutton, and moist foods. And he who has a cold complexion should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and the day he is cupped, he should drink more than he eats;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before cupping, or after, to strengthen the principal members; and the blood should be thinned, but it is not necessary for those who are hot to drink it.
The cups that are applied without scarification are those that are placed over the liver, and over the spleen, and for gout, and over the belly and the buttock and the loins and the hip, because these parts do not tolerate being cut over the skin, and it is only done to draw blood from one part to another, as we place them on the breasts when the nose bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, as we put cups on the belly and on the buttock to reduce the limb;
and removes the pain, when there is blockage or stone, thus removes by its attractive power perhaps the blockage, or loosens the stone from its place;
and so it does when it is placed on the liver and on the spleen when there is retained flatulence, and these cups are applied empty to only suck; and sometimes they are applied together with fire, and sometimes filled with lukewarm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that one fills the cup with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled for this.
The method of the cupping glass applied with fire is as follows:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, like for inserting a needle, and let it be made of brass, smooth in front so that it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of brass or iron, to place a lit candle, and let there be both large and small ones according to the illnesses and the age of those who receive them;
for the cupping glasses for children are different from those for the elderly, and for the thin different from those for the fat.
And one should apply this cupping glass to the limb in this way:
take a wax candle or a wick, and place it in the middle of the cupping glass across the bar which is in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be over the hole that we mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the wick as before, and repeats this often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass then which is used in the case of pleurisy, acutely, there is no bar nor hole, and fire is used only when it is full of water, and it is placed only on the limb;
and this is the method:
Leeches are used only on limbs where one cannot place cupping glasses due to their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and other similar places;
and the method of use is that when you find leeches that are in clean fresh water without filth, take them;
and put them in fresh water for a night, so that they become hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then be bled by vein or cupping glass, then rub the limb until it is red, and place the leeches on it;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for this is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, then wash the area well, first with vinegar, and then with water, and then wipe it;
and if the area bleeds too much after the leeches are removed, wet a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on, until the bleeding has stopped;
and if the blood flow is excessive, apply crushed vitriol, or gallnuts, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or you can put on the area half of peeled beans, and leave them until they dry on the spot, this will stop it immediately;
and if you need more, then take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to attach, rub the area with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until the blood comes out, and then put them on, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you see that they are falling off, sprinkle on a little aloe and crushed salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and concerns the repair of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that fools throw themselves into this chapter, who have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read a letter of them;
and for this reason, knowledge is scarce in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing of it except through the knowledge of ancient books, which I have studied so much that I have extracted the knowledge, and through experience, and through the practice of my life;
and I have here described in this chapter what is contained, and have abbreviated it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are administered, as I have done in these two preceding chapters.
It is therefore necessary that we state in the prologue of this book the main points of the discussion and the chapters where the wise man applies his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or sprain or break occurs to someone, you must hasten to treat the patient on both sides, unless something prevents you entirely, such as weakness of the body, or infancy, or old age; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold, thin foods, that is to say, cold broths, and bird and venison meat, and do not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not overfill yourself with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you no longer fear a hot abscess, or the spreading of matter in the limb;
then the patient should return to their former diet that they were used to.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary to nourish the patient with foods that provide substantial nourishment, where there is viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow's tripe, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the fracture repairs and heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal or knit well according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor can those that are too tender, like the bones of small children;
but have no fear, re-align the broken bone, apply a firm splint that supports and binds the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not move it at all from its position, and for this reason it is necessary to nourish it with rich foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the chest, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another obliquely, like the cut of a quill for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another obliquely, like the cut of a quill for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small crack.
And each type has its own technique and its own specific instrument for restoration, according to what is recalled in its place;
and the fracture of the bone is recognized by the fact that the place is twisted, and appears clearly by default, and makes a sound when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel much pain, then there is no fracture;
but there may well be twisting, or a fissure, or a small fracture. So you should not move it with your hand, but apply the medicines that come later, and then immediately bandage it carefully.
And know that for the fracture that goes across, and the two parts are separated, they must be immediately set evenly, before hot swelling comes there;
and if hot swelling comes there, leave it for a few days, until the swelling subsides;
then set it evenly as best you can lightly and carefully, and know that its restoration is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces;
then bandage it, as is appropriate below.
And if there are broken pieces in the bone, extend it from two sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken limb are separated, skillfully bring the additional pieces back to their places as best you can, and be careful that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and carefully join the two ends of the bones in the best possible alignment.
And feel it carefully with your hand if it seems to you that it is not right:
then straighten it gently, and do not constrict it too much, nor press it as those do who, through their work, cause a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is properly set, warn the patient carefully not to move it, neither while awake nor while sleeping, nor while turning, nor in any other way; and ensure that the limb is so securely positioned that they feel no pain. For when they feel no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be positioned in such a way that they feel no pain;
and ensure that the limb is so securely positioned that they feel no pain. For when they feel no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be positioned in such a way that they feel no pain; and take care that it is set straight, so that no crookedness develops when it is restored;
and the characteristics of the broken limb are as I have told you.
Know that broken limbs vary in smallness and largeness and in shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar: so it is necessary to wrap soft and fine linen cloths; and those that are large, such as the thigh and leg:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and strong bandage, for the wide bandage embraces the whole large limb, and constricts it evenly on all sides, so that there is no unevenness;
then tie around light padding, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little with the whole bandage, then go above the break and tighten less, as the break then moves away from the break a little;
and loosen the bandage little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and wrap it again over the broken place;
then go back to the part below the break, and tighten it moderately, not too tight nor too loose, as we have said in the first place above;
then put between the bandages linen padding or cloths, until it is all even, then tie a bandage over everything, and then put your well-made splints on, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, apply something soothing and warm to the abscess, which removes the swelling, and leave it like that for a few days;
then tighten your splints, and they should be wisely cut half the width of a large cane, or from wood which one makes roofing shingles, or from palm branches, and they should be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that is placed over the break be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large; then tighten the splints as you did at the first binding, then tie over it a thread suitably, as in the first binding over the fracture; narrower above, always less;
and the threads must be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bindings with twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, for the binding cannot be even if it is too tight, and there should not be less than a finger's width between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after tightening in healthy places, put linen wads, or carded wool, under them so that he is not hurt.
When the wound is with the fracture, and the heart is broken, I will discuss the treatment hereafter.
And know that it is not appropriate to bind all fractured limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, splints should not be applied until after five or seven days, or more depending on your certainty of a hot abscess arising;
and see here the method of ancient plasters to restore fractures, dislocations, and sprains:
and you should take the flour that sticks to the walls of the mill, and mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common way of the plaster restoring the fracture in many cases, and especially in women and small children, because it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and sprain: take three of abaris and labdanum and elecampane and asafetida and gum arabic and musk, each ten drams; myrrh and aloes, each five drams; mastic nine drams; and make them into a powder, and mix them with egg white; if the person's complexion is hot, then use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is beneficial for many people.
Another type of plaster that is good for sprains: take mugwort and marshmallow, each ten drams; myrrh and aloe, each nine drams; acacia, six drams; Armenian bole, ten drams, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply it.
Another kind of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and soothes the resulting pain, and the cut from the bone, and the break: take new wool, and soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and put it on the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and cleanly removes the pains.
Another kind of plaster that restores broken bones: take dried fig leaves, and ground ivy leaves, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another kind of plaster for the restoration of a bone fracture and to diminish the remains of the abscess. Take marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with coriander water, or with water, and use it.
Another kind of plaster, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes at the restoration of the limb. Take marshmallow roots, and flax seed, pomegranate rind, melilot, and elderflower, and violet and chamomile flowers, equal parts of all; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates said in his book that one should not put on a broken limb to restore it anything but a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else more, and said that it should be between the two, neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a broken limb, to restore it, somewhat warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloe and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: take mugwort and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and marshmallow, and salt equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and apply it.
And then unbind it a little later, and take care if the patient feels any pain, or if the bone has moved from its place; if not, do not untie it for many days. And if pain comes to the place, or itching, without rest or swelling, then hurry, and untie it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and wash the area, until the itching stops, and the pain is soothed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then apply dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind it overnight, until you are sure of a warm abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain is removed, then begin again the fine binding, and a little of the plaster, and do not tighten it as much as before; and continue gradually until it is healed.
And if you see that the warm abscess and redness and pain and swelling are completely gone, and you need plaster and bandage, then start again, just as you did the first time.
And if the limb does not experience any of what we have described, do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes leave it for twenty days, depending on what one sees, until the fracture airs out, and the joining of the flesh above approaches;
then bind it more tightly than before, and increase his food, as I have said before;
and if you see the place drying more than it should, know that nourishment cannot get there; then moisten it with lukewarm water, every time you unbind it, and this should be every third day, and loosen the bandage a little;
by this method, then, nourishment flows to the limb, and quickly corrects what foolish physicians do, who improperly set the limb:
this is bad, and also frightening work, and I see nothing else to do but to leave it alone and work on it correctly.
There are many kinds of fractures, and various forms, and the causes are distinct;
for there are fractures caused by the blow of a sword, and the neck of the bone cuts the entire bone down to the syfac which is underneath the bone, as an axe does with wood; and this type of fracture is called a "hatchet fracture".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this type of fracture is called "complete";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blunt percussion, or a split or a cut from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a piercing fracture, which reaches down to the membrane that is under the bone, or it is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And also a wound which is placed in the bone as thin as a hair, and the crack is small, and therefore this fracture is called "hairline";
and if the wound, which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, causes the piece of bone to go down, and the place is sunken in as do the cauldron makers when they strike the cauldrons; then the stone enters inside.
And this happens more often to those who have moist bones in their head, like a child's head;
and it happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated like splinters; and I will speak about it in its place.
And we recognize all kinds of fractures by the depression above them, and probing with a tent, and by the corrupted flesh which is on top.
The hairline fracture is recognized because when the bone is uncovered, and one rubs ink on it, the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of a fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting bile, and loss of consciousness, and stretching, and swelling, and high fever, and the eyes bulging and red, and other similar symptoms with many variations, then it certainly cannot heal.
And if you do not see alarming symptoms, and you hope for recovery, then begin treatment.
And when the wounded person first comes to you, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day as quickly as you can.
And if it is in summer, then hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue under the bone becomes corrupted, and the symptoms we have mentioned appear.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, then you must cut the fractured part thus:
And you should take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in all the ways you can, and over the shape of the wound as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs when uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, treat it appropriately, and then fill the area with cloths soaked in rose oil; And let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and you are sure of the cessation of bleeding; Then begin to remove the bone around the edges, and this is done according to two methods of operation:
One method is that you cut with a narrow chisel in front, and this is the shape:
And then use another chisel larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different chisels, some narrow and others wide, and they should be pointed, and made of Indian steel;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce around it, before you use chisels with drills, not so deep that they pierce through the bone of the skull, and it should have on the tip a flange or a circle, so as not to let the point pass through the bone;
and you must have several of them, so that each one comes in its place according to the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for every skull;
and this is the form of the three types of drills:
The method for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place a drill on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the drill somewhere else a little further on, and so do all around, then cut with chisels the piece of bone which is between the holes, and do this as carefully and lightly as you can, as we have said, until you remove the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have, such as tongs, forceps;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and extracted the bone, you must cut the piece that remains of the bone with another instrument similar to a chisel, but it must be thinner and more delicate than the other chisel;
and if any small bones or splinters remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with dressings and ointments that we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is the one that Galen described, which is safer; and he praises it highly, and these are his words. You must first expose a part of the bone, there where the fracture appears most obvious, so that when you have exposed that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the shape:
And do not cut on one side, and the part is sharp on both sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet, so that you lightly cut the bone all around, and take good care of the membrane that is underneath;
if it is attached to the bone, remove it lightly, for it can be removed well without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the membrane, and the bone is only cut on the surface, and there are small pieces, then it is necessary to smooth this roughness, and remove the splinters with a fine scraper of which you should have various sizes, to administer in each place the most suitable one, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
So start again with large scrapers, and then with finer ones, and do not stop doing this until it is good.
In each of the other hair-line cuts and fine fractures, you must administer treatment according to its correction;
and this is something that is not entrusted to one who has not applied himself to the study of this art.
And if the peritoneum is exposed, you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth, folded in two or three, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so as not to aggravate the peritoneum, then apply another bandage over it, and do not tighten it except enough to hold the wound covering in place;
and leave it like this for a day or two, until the hot inflammation has subsided, then untie it and apply medications such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and birthwort, and similar things;
and make a powder of these things, and put it on the wound, and constantly apply cleansing medications without causticity;
and make sure the wound is always clean, that you do not leave the ointment there, and do not allow pus to collect, because when pus collects on the wound dressing, it will rot and become infected, and this will cause the patient great harm;
because when you put something caustic on the peritoneum, it blackens on the surface. Therefore, take heed, if any bad accident happens to the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful.
And if blackness appears only because of the medicine that has been applied, which has such a property, then you must take one part honey, and three parts rose oil and a drop of glue, and put it on the peritoneum; then treat it with the appropriate treatments, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both parts of the nose above are broken, or just one of them, for there are two bones;
and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, but only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must insert your little finger into the nostril, and align the fracture inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and be careful that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the spot, then you must align it using the end of a somewhat thick rod.
And if the break is in two parts, do the same, and hurry to restore it the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot swelling has subsided, then insert linen cloth tents into the end of the nose, if the break is in one part.
Or insert another one on the other side, if the break is there; and the tents should be so thick that they fill the holes of the nose.
And some restorers say that the tents should be moistened with butter and changed every day. It does not seem good to me, but they should be moistened in a mixture of egg white and powder of wheat flour; then leave the tent until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are placed in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient breathes through it; now do whatever you wish.
And if hot abscesses appear in the nose while you are working there, apply cerate or cotton moistened with rose oil, or a little diachylon.
And if hot abscesses do not appear there, apply a soothing plaster of sesame flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then place light compresses on top, and do not tie the nose;
And if the nasal fracture is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract them with suitable instruments, then sew up the wound, and treat it with flesh-generating and healing things, such as suitable plasters and ointments;
And if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead tubes in it until it is healed.
When the mandible/jaw is broken underneath, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is internal only, and is not broken in two, except for internal fragments, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; And if the fracture is in the left mandible/jaw, put your right index finger in, and gently push the fracture inwards, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the fracture of the mandible/jaw is separated in two, then you must apply traction from both sides until it is even.
And if loosening or breaking of the teeth occurs, secure them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then apply a plaster to the broken mandible/jaw, and put on a double bandage; And put over the bandage a well-made large splint, or a piece of leather evenly shaped, long and wide according to the jaw, and tie it on as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, untie it on the third day, and then reset what has changed; and apply a plaster, made from mill dust with plenty of egg or sesame flour, after you have removed the previous plaster;
and put light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until he is healed; often he is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses develop, then administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and a wound together, see if any piece of bone has been removed; then carefully remove it with instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a lancet according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, stitch the wound, if it is large, and apply one of the plasters suitable for this, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The forceps often break forward, towards the shoulder, and the breakage occurs in three ways:
or it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is as follows when the fracture is without a wound: you should have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder where the forceps/clavicle is broken; and the other extends the neck towards the side;
then set the fracture evenly with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither a bump nor a depression.
And if you need to extend it further, place a round bolster made of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and its thickness should be according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and press down on the bolster with your hand, so that you evenly set the fracture, as is necessary.
And if you cannot draw the end of the clavicle outwards, because it goes inwards too deeply, then the patient must lie often on his back, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and the practitioner pushes the shoulder down, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.
And then straighten the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it shattered, then you must cut into it;
and gently pull out the pieces, and if the bone cannot be joined because of some overlapping, then trim it with one of the incisors that you have; but you should place this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the periosteum:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and is as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the requirements of the work;
and it has two heads, as you see, and one is wide, and the other is narrow, like the shape of the wound that you made when you pulled out the bones;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, then stitch the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with compresses and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses develop there, soak a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The tightening of the bone, when it is without wounds and without incision, is that you put on the bone a plaster of mill dust and egg white, and put light padding on it, and put a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very large bandage, a palm wide, then put a doubled cloth over the padding and the plaster; then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around the bandage so that the ends of the bandage hang down; and place the splint over the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck and under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit; and bring it around from each side, and when you see that the bandaging holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the splint does not move on the broken bone, then check it every day, and when the bandaging loosens, tighten it;
and have the patient lie on his back, and when he sleeps, put a small pillow under his armpit to raise the shoulder up; this will relieve the pressure on the fracture by easing the shoulder, or you can tie his arm to his neck and not untie it unless some bad incident occurs, until twenty days have passed;
then reapply the plaster, if you see that there is need for it, and tighten it and leave it thus, until he is recovered;
and it is restored in most cases within twenty-eight days, and in some men, sooner.
of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks except in a wide place or in the middle, and one does not know it except by touch;
so prepare it according to the form of the break, and restore it according to its natural form, in every way that you can;
then put on the area mill dust with plenty of egg, and light stuffing, and put on a double cloth; then put on a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there are hollows in any place on the shoulder, fill that hollow with linen stuffing, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all firmly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day;
and every time it loosens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it is out of place, and have the patient lie on their side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.
And when this time is complete, unbind it, and be certain, for it is not a bone that dislocates easily.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes forward, and points below the heart, then cut over it, and remove it, and do what we have said regarding the breaking of the clavicle to soothe a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breastbone/sternum
The breastbone/sternum is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks lower down.
And when it is broken in the middle, it sinks downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and coughs, and perhaps vomits blood, and the displacement is visible in the broken bone, and one can feel it well.
And the restoration is as follows: the patient often lies on his back, and you place a cushion between the shoulder blades, then press the shoulders, and bring the ribs of the two sides together with your hands, and be careful to set it evenly in all the ways that you can, so that the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then apply plasters and compresses on a thin splint of wood, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and wrap the bandage around the back, and tighten it appropriately, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs to be untied, because of corrosion or itching that occurs at the site, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and untie it, and scrape the plaster, and address what has appeared there by means of treatments;
then reapply the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs only occurs in thick places near the back, and at the end inside, and they only bend because they are slippery; and one feels it well by examination with the fingers.
And the restoration is that you set the fracture evenly, as it should be. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a splint, if you need to.
And if the rib fracture is pointing inwards, the patient feels very great pain, and a pricking sensation, like pleurisy, because the bone pricks the membrane; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits a large amount of blood, and this is a serious condition, and the ancients have put much effort into it.
And there are some who say that it is necessary to administer foods that swell the belly, to push the fracture outwards.
We do not do this, so that hot abscesses do not develop there, if they have not already appeared. And if they have appeared, then treat them.
And some of them said that one should place cupping glasses on the area, to suck strongly, and this seems reasonable; however, there is concern that the cupping glass may attract excess fluids to the area due to its weakened state.
And some of them said that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil, and tents should be placed between the ribs to make the place even all around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that they cannot bear from the bone piercing the skin, and there is concern for the patient, then it is necessary to cut over the location of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the peritoneum;
and then one should cut the bone, and pull gently, and then sew the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses develop, then apply cloths soaked in rose oil, and place them on the area;
and meanwhile treat the area as appropriate for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where he should, until he is healed.
and also in the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, take note if you see their hands softened and swollen and dead, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it.
Know that he is mortally [injured] in many cases, and if he moves them and feels well when they are squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is saved, and that the patient will be cured, if care is applied.
And if a similar thing occurs in the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, note if the feet are softened, and if the same symptoms are there as in the hands, and on the back jumping flatulence and involuntary defecation;
and when he is turned on his stomach, involuntary defecation occurs. And when he is turned on his back and he wants to sit up, he cannot. Know that he is mortally wounded: so do not work on his treatment.
And if this accident does not happen to him, then the matter is less serious.
And the treatment is that you look to see if there is a hot abscess, then put on the spine rose oil or oil of egg yolks, until it is soothed;
then apply one of the strengthening and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and tell the patient to rest; and not to sleep on the side where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, then it is necessary to cut to the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "tail head," then place the ball of your left hand there and align it with your other hand as best you can, then apply the plaster and splint, if you need it;
then bind it, and if there is a separated bone, then cut open, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it happens, it only happens with a small fragmentation at the head; and cut lengthwise, and lean towards the inside, and the patient feels pain in the area, and a pricking sensation, and swells up where it is broken.
And the restoration is such that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture; and you know what the fracture is and its shape;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then make this fracture even, so that it is in its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it leans inwards, then have the patient lie on their stomach, so that the resetting of this fracture is prepared for you. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the plaster, then put on a splint of wood or leather, and tighten the fracture, so that it does not move;
and pad the place below the ribs, so that the bandage is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess develops there, do not touch it until the hot abscess has subsided, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and tighten it as needed, if there is no adverse event;
of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder blade is that which is between the neck and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, it should be restored according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a stick of medium thickness, of this shape:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them up, and have the patient sit on a seat;
then place their broken arm on the stick, up to the armpit, and have a curved piece of wood in the middle, then hang some heavy object on it or have the assistant extend it downwards;
then the physician sets the fracture by putting his hands together, until the fracture returns to its proper place.
And the other method is that you lay the patient on their back, and tie their hand to their neck, then instruct two assistants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands, and the other to hold below with a cord, and each pulls on their side.
And if you want the pulling to be stronger, tie a cord below the fracture, and above the fracture, and have each assistant pull on their side.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, you should place a cord under the armpit, and another towards the neck, below the fracture;
and similarly if the fracture is near the neck, a cord must be placed there gently, without force, so that the fracture is aligned with the place, and with the neck;
then set the fracture properly, as it should be, and bind it, unless an abscess develops there.
And if an abscess develops there, do not bind it for up to seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides;
then bind it, and the way to bind it is to put the plaster on the fracture, then bring the arm against the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the chest;
and put on the bandage, and tighten it over the shoulder and over the arm, so that the arm is in the shape of a star, unless something prevents it, or if the bone is displaced.
And if you are concerned that the bone might move, use splints, and place a splint on the fracture wider and stronger than the others, and have a finger's width of space between each splint, and each splint should be large enough to extend three fingers' width past the fracture on each side;
then bind over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, tighter and less loosely.
And if you consider the placement of the splints, and the bandaging, as we have described, at the time you are setting the broken limb, and you fear a hot abscess, leave it unbound until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check the bandaging every three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur at the location, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. Adjust it, as we have described.
And if no such issue arises, do not unbind it before three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, with his hands on his stomach;
and place a cushion filled evenly with wool under the shoulder, and check every hour of the day or night that the alignment of the broken limb does not shift, or that the bandaging does not loosen;
correct it with the power of medicine, and give him the food that we have mentioned before, in such a way that the food is initially light; and when he begins to recover, let it be substantial.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be fully healed in forty days; and then it should be untied and administered a bath and medicinal ointments to restore the area.
And if the stiffness is severe and swollen, it takes fifty days or two months to loosen.
of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "radius" bones, of which one is small, and this is the one that follows the thumb;
and the other is large, and is the one that is below, towards the little finger;
perhaps the large radius bone is broken alone, or the small one, and perhaps both together.
When the small radius bone is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and more serious than when they are both broken together.
If it is the small radius bone that is broken alone, it should be extended a little, lightly, and set evenly.
And if it is the large radius bone, it must be extended more strongly;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the ball of the hand higher than the rest, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient be propped up on himself, with a cushion in front of him, higher up, so that the patient doesn't suffer any strain;
then let the practitioner extend his arm on the underside of his hand, or with a cord, and another practitioner on the other side above.
And then let the physician set it evenly, according to its best form.
And if there are pieces in the fracture, put each one in its place, and if there is any separated that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut open and remove it, as we have said before.
And if there is a wound with the fracture, I have spoken of it in the individual chapter; then undertake the treatment.
And if at the beginning of the restoration hot abscesses arise, then glue on a cloth of cerate made with rose oil and white wax, that is neither too hard nor too soft; and tie a cloth over it delicately, until the hot abscess is soothed.
And then remove the cerate, and apply a poultice of mill dust with plenty of egg, then apply the splints, and the splint for the fracture should always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and tighten more over the fracture than elsewhere, and always less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and the bandages that are over the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and the bandages that are over the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and the thread with which it is tied should be linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any adverse event occurs to the limb, such as itching, then you must bathe the limb with warm water, until the itching is soothed;
and let the limb rest, not tightly bound.
And then resume the bandaging, and if the bandage is loose and the bone separated, or similar thing, then adjust it.
And take care if nourishment cannot reach the limb, because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it thus for a few days, until the nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happen to the patient, do not unbind it for up to twenty days.
or thereabouts, then he hangs his hands around his neck, and his neck should be straight, and he should avoid movement and restlessness, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or in thirty-five, and perhaps in twenty days, depending on the compositions and complexions of the humors.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers, few fractures occur, and there is often only swelling.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, it is necessary that the patient sits cross-legged, and sits straight before him evenly;
then he places his hand on your outstretched thigh, and the practitioner extends the broken bones, and sets them evenly, until they are well joined;
and applies the plaster and the padding, if no abscess develops, then applies a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the hollow of the palm, make a ball of cloths, and instruct the patient to squeeze it against his fractured palm; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather, as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as needed.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must put a splint on top and another underneath in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then tie it all around the hand, and tighten the bond between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs at a knuckle of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it evenly, as needed; and bind it with the palm, and if you see fit, put a small straight splint to raise the fracture, so it does not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index or one of the others, align it, and tie it with the healthy finger next to it; or you tie them all together in one grip, which is better, or you put on a splint, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and in the treatment of a hot abscess, and help those it affects, as I have said.
The thigh bone is often broken, and it is clearly visible when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is such that one ties one bandage above the break, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends his bandage on his side equally;
and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is near the top of the thigh, let one of the bandages be towards the buttock, and the other bandage below the break.
And also if it is near the knee, then let the bandage be next to the knee, and the extension be downwards;
then the physician sets the bone straight with his two hands, until it is in its natural shape, and then applies the plaster, and bandages it, if no abscess develops.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside then return to your work and your treatment; The binding is done in this way.
You must wrap a hard bandage, doubled in two or three, over the fracture, leaving the excess, then bend the leg so that the heel comes to the base of the buttock, and place a long thread between the thigh and the leg, next to the knee underneath, and bring the ends of the thread to the top;
then turn the bandage over the leg and the thigh, then place splints on the fracture, and place a splint on the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to even out the pressure, then begin to tie tightly three or four turns over the fracture; and the higher you go above the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then pull on the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie the three splints that are on top, then go back down to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like that, until no abscess, swelling, or other similar thing appears. And if it does occur, untie it, and address what appears there, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that stick out, you must remove them, if possible; and if not, then it is necessary to cut into the area and pull them out; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are put on it, just as with the shoulder and the arm;
however, in a restoration done this way, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, according to the differences in complexions.
Know that in the kneecap, fractures rarely occur, but it bends often.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and it happens with a wound, and without a wound, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one sets even that which is round with one's fingers, as much as it can be assembled by feel;
then apply the plaster, and put a round splint, if you need one, and tighten it as needed, then consider all the dispositions that we have discussed in other fractures, such as hot abscesses and other similar things; so apply to each injury what is appropriate, until it is healed.
of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is rightly called "fibula," and the other is called "tibia";
and fractures occur just as they do in the arm, and therefore the restoration is similar to that of the arm, and the procedure is the same. And if both bones are broken together, then the leg turns in all directions.
And if the slender bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, there is great pain, and it is clearly visible; and it turns downwards.
Then apply traction, and set it evenly, and bind the splints evenly as well;
but nevertheless, if the fracture is severe, and there are many pieces, the traction must be less and lighter; and align it according to your skill.
And when you have completed all your work, then take two wooden splints, shaped so that they enclose the leg on one side and the other, and are the length of the leg from the knee to below;
then wrap in two places a bandage above and below, and tie it in the middle also, and at this point the leg will not be able to bend to the right or left, and so it is well;
and some apply a cradle the length of the leg, and it is made of wood, and the leg is placed in it to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day to see if there is a hot abscess or another problem; thus treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but in the bones of the foot sometimes there is a fracture and in the toes a little, and there rarely occurs more than a simple fracture in several places.
And if there is a fracture in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, have the patient put his foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then immediately put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their places;
then put the plaster and padding on it, and place under the arch of the foot a small board with two flat ends, then tie it to the leg appropriately, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether they are broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, set them as we have described for the fingers of the hand; then put on the broken toe a splint along the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board which I mentioned, and tie it appropriately;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, put on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and tie the board under the foot; and it should extend over the end of the board beyond the arch of the foot, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have mentioned for other fractures, from what we have said; and treat each incident as appropriate.
of the fracture of the wrist bone
When the bone of a woman's hip is broken, have her sit spread-legged, then lean her back, and be held from behind;
then the practitioner fills the patient's vagina with cotton, and puts in as much as a fist;
then have the woman stand, and lift her back little by little, and then the cotton jumps out, until it comes to the opening of the vagina, and the bone returns with the wad;
and when she needs to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back, and do this for seven days or thereabouts: thus the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a tube to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the vagina; then blow strongly into the tube, until the bladder is inflated inside: the vagina will return to its place, the fracture;
then it should be filled with cotton, and left like that for some days, until it is healed.
And when the wrist bone of a man, or of a woman, is broken, restore it as we have described for the hip bone;
and these fractures, close together, are not hidden from him who applies his study and practice, and understands my book.
For the fracture itself, in many arrangements, indicates the right way to restore it: understand it then.
For the penis, when it is broken, take a goose quill and place the penis inside; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or thereabouts, and it will be quickly healed.
of fracture with a wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as in the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that it be healed immediately, as the healings that we have described demonstrate.
And if the wound heals, staunch it with vitriol if you have nothing else, then begin to restore the fracture in that same hour, or that day, if hot abscesses do not arise.
And if hot abscesses arise, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are calmed, and do not touch them on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a bad outcome.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the open flesh, then you must set it lightly with your hands, using slight extension.
And if the extension devices are not ready for you to use with your hands, then set it with this instrument which is made of iron, which is seven or eight fingers long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this reason the physician needs to obtain three or four, according to what he needs for each treatment of a fracture;
and it should be round and a little thick, so that it does not bend under the pressure on the limb during your work, and it should be pointed at the front, and thicker from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called "lever," because the curved end must be placed on the end of the exposed bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is aligned with the other. And if the fracture is fine, and the instrument cannot grip the bone well, then you must trim the end of the bone, so that the instrument can have a hold on it.
And if you cannot reduce the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument, either an incisor or a saw, as you are able;
then smooth what remains of the bone's roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is set, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
So work until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in dark, astringent wine, and especially if it is in summer; and do not put on the wound a cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause rot and corruption;
then apply splints once you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and fit the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted by the bandage;
and many times foolish physicians have done this, and have caused the patient to die or sometimes to become crippled; and the bandaging should be softer and gentler than other bandages.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that a bad outcome might occur, as we have said, and you find pain at the location, then you should not apply splints; but wrap around, instead of splints, hard cloths, and tie them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming at the wound, then remove what you have put on with wine, and apply a wound-healing ointment, such as tetrapharmacum ointment and similar ones.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and healthy.
And the limb must be positioned in such a way that the pus flows downwards easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but continually produces pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, for which you must explore the wound with a probe, and remove all these separated pieces which cause this pain.
And if a fistula develops at the site, or another kind of infection, you must treat it according to what is said in its chapter earlier.
And when the bone is broken, and exposed on the limb, like the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and other similar large limbs, do not pull on it, because death often results, but leave it until it rots;
perhaps it will fall off by itself after 20 or 30 days, then treat the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
We often see, after the healing of a fracture, especially when it is near a joint, an ugly thing to see, the shape of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Therefore, take care if the knot is fresh: then administer styptic medicines, such as aloe, frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and put them on the knot at night in compresses, and tighten it well, and do not loosen it for many days;
and put them on the knot at night in compresses, and tighten it well, and do not loosen it for many days; and then undo it, and start another one, until the nodule is removed;
or you tighten over it a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the nodule has already turned into a hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut over it, and incise the apparent excess; or you scrape it with a scraper, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after healing
When the bone fracture is restored, and the limb remains weak and thin afterward, it happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of excessive irrigation (washing/bathing); or because of too much movement, not at the right time; or because he has little blood in his body, and is thus weak.
And the treatment is that you make the patient eat, and make the body supple, until the blood is increased in him; and administer baths to him, and give him joy and happiness;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch attracts great nourishment to it, and frequently bathe it with warm water, so that the nourishment flows to the limb; and it returns to its natural form.
of the crooked limb after healing When the limb is crooked after restoration, and the bone is visibly broken, and the shape of the limb is ugly, nevertheless it does not lose its natural function:
so do not believe the fools who say that the limb must be broken all over again, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land;
and this practice is condemned, and great harm comes from it, and possibly death;
however, if the knots and distortions are fresh, they should be bathed with hot water, in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon, and take marshmallow mucilage, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and make a plaster on top;
or take ripe figs, and crush them with dove droppings, and similar medicines that reduce swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with wet hands. And movement should be applied to the limb every hour.
And if the crookedness is old and hardened, like stone, and it is necessary to remove it with an instrument, then it must be cut down to the bone, with a thin scalpel, gently; and put care and study into the treatment.
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is deformed, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When a dislocation happens to someone, it must be reduced immediately without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it can only be put back in place with difficulty;
therefore it should not be moved at the time when it is swollen: often it causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, have the patient bled, then leave it alone until the swelling has subsided;
then bathe the limb with hot water and oil, then reset it gently, and treat each limb as the treatment comes to its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head down to the feet.
It rarely happens that both mandibles (jawbones) are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is in two ways: either they are slightly out of their places, and slightly softened; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and saliva runs from the mouth which he cannot hold, nor can he close his mouth, and he mumbles his speech with his tongue.
When the dislocation is minor, it returns by itself in most cases.
And if it is complete and full, then you must reduce it quickly, and do not delay;
and in such a way that the assistant holds the patient's head, and the physician puts the thumb of one of his hands at the root of the jaw's dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on both sides; and the other fingers of the hands should be outside, to apply even pressure;
and instruct the patient to relax his jaws and move them in all directions. And the physician sets it evenly, until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then moisten them with hot water and oil, until you can reduce them easily;
and do not delay the reduction, as we have said.
And when they are reduced evenly, and the patient's mouth closes well without difficulty, then apply cloths soaked in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and the patient should sleep on their back, with their head placed between two cushions, so that they do not move it to the right or left, and do not try to chew, but take light food, until the pain is gone, and the jaws are healed;
and then they can chew what they want lightly, and not strain to open their mouth when eating and drinking, until the jaw is well healed and healthy.
And if the two jawbones cannot be reset at once, and are not returned to their places, fevers and sudden illnesses may occur, and possibly diarrhea, and perhaps vomiting pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal; and many times the one to whom it happens dies within nine days.
The splint cannot dislocate inwards from the side of the arm and chest, but it is sometimes dislocated outwards, and one feels it clearly.
And the restoration is such that the patient lies often on his back and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply the plaster and the bandage, and tighten it;
and the head which is towards the elbow cannot dislocate; at least not easily, and if it does dislocate at any time, then put it back in its place, as we have said;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and tighten it, and tell the patient to rest until he is healed;
and in the same way the head of the shoulder is reset, when it is separated from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
one of which is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the chest/breast; and sometimes it dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate backwards because of the shoulder blade, and it does not dislocate inwards because of the sinews/nerves;
and it often dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, because in these it jumps out easily;
in those who have enough flesh, it dislocates with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And sometimes it happens to some men a blow or a fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated because of this.
It is therefore necessary that you examine it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is down towards the armpit, and compare the injured shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find a hollow at the top of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring their hand to their nose, nor make any movements;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly by touch;
and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reset when it is recent, or if the patient is a child.
And the method is that the practitioner lifts the patient's hand upwards, then places their fists under the armpit, and forcefully lifts the joint upwards into place; and the practitioner lifts the hand and extends it upwards, then puts it underneath; it will return quickly.
And if it does not return as we have said within a few days, then the patient should be bathed in hot water; and the practitioner should administer softening and soothing ointments, such as a decoction of marshmallow, fenugreek and melilot in water, and it should be applied;
then the patient should lie on their back, and a pad of wool, even, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit, then the practitioner should place their heel on the pad and carefully lift the head of the shoulder, and pull the patient's hand;
and another practitioner should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder will return immediately, and you see, reset it in this manner:
and you should have a man present who is taller than the patient; and he should stand upright beside him, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit up, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another practitioner should pull the patient's hand downwards towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation will immediately return (to its proper place).
And it is also reduced in another way:
a long stick is driven into the ground, the top of which should be as round as a pestle, and neither too thick nor too thin; then it should be placed under the patient, but with soft cloths on top, and the patient lies along the length of the stick;
then his hand is pulled downwards strongly on the other side, and the joint will quickly return to its place;
and if it will not return despite all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a firebrand two arms long and four fingers wide, which has a round end so it can be inserted deeply under the armpit, in this manner:
then tie soft cloths over the end of the stick, so that the stick does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm at the wrist, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of sufficient width, and his hand should be extended downwards, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint will return to its place immediately.
And when it is in place, in whatever manner, you must put an even layer of wool under the armpit, then apply the prepared plaster of mill dust, with incense and egg white, over the whole shoulder and around, then tighten it suitably under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and bind the hand to his neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And he should eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after 5 or 7 days, and move it; and if it is firm and not soft, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come there, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries with three holes, as described above in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot lift his arm up, then know that the nerves at the top of the shoulder are cut or stretched or weakened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is near the chest, and the breasts, or behind, occurs from a push, and stretching of the hands, and there one applies another dressing;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if after healing, stiffness comes to the limb, and slowness in movement, then the patient should use baths many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and returns to its former state.
of the dislocation of the elbow
Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and with difficulty returns;
and it is dislocated in all directions, and especially forward and backward, and the dislocation is not hidden, for it is clearly seen and felt; and dislocates according to each position. And when you compare the injured elbow with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is separated, and he cannot bend his arm or touch his shoulder at all.
And you must reduce it before a hot abscess develops there, because if a hot abscess were to develop, it would be difficult to reduce;
and perhaps it cannot be completely reduced, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and more painful, and sometimes death results.
And the restoration, if it is such that it can be reduced, is that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arm should be spread, and the physician's hands placed along the side, above and below, and push the joint with his thumbs together, or at the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is at the front, it is reduced when he bends his hand with his hand, and strikes with the base of the palm the side that is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, then apply strong extension;
and two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should hold him, so that he does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm in each direction, after you have wrapped it with a double-layered cloth, long and wide;
and when the physician has joined the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with some egg white, and bind it firmly, and suspend the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then untie it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the bandage and leave it;
and if you see that the joint is not tight, reapply the plaster and the bandage, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set; then untie it.
And if he feels severe pain after the reduction of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and apply pressure until it is relieved; or you put on the joint a greasy sheep's bladder, then leave it for a day and a night, then remove it, and have him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint temperately, then put the bladder back on, and then enter the bath; and do this two or three times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, put on warm, moist cow dung with butter, and bind it on;
it will return to its proper position.
Dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and the return is easier than other joints. However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the very hour it is dislocated, before the area swells, or a hot abscess develops there.
And the reduction is done by placing the injured hand on a table, and the practitioner extends the hand, and carefully sets it evenly, placing their palm over the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns to place.
However, you must check if it is properly in place; then have the patient place the back of their hand on a table for the extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient should place the back of their hand on the table, and the physician should place their hand over the appearance of the joint.
If it returns to place now, that is good. If not, bind it with soothing plasters for hot abscesses, and leave it thus without restarting.
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put it in place after a few days, the joint will remain crooked;
and it doesn't harm the patient except that the hand is weakened, and he cannot grip anything at all: then know that the nerves are cut, or the artery;
so there is no other solution but to burn with a cautery next to the break, and perhaps nothing else will help.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster that we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then untie it and leave it like that.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, then wet it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated in any direction, sometimes on the back of the hand or on the palm;
then stretch the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the tip of the finger, and bend it toward the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then set it straight that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it during the day, and make it move, and bind it again at night;
and do this often, until it is stable, and do the same if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do the same, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or the neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocated, there is no cure, because death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that the excrement comes out involuntarily, and he cannot hold it, and often some limbs are paralyzed, either both thighs or both arms or one.
And often the spine is displaced in four parts;
that which is displaced to the rear is called "gibbosity": (or hunchback)
The treatment is that you look to see if the gibbosity has come from childhood: then there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or blows or similar things, the ancients spoke of methods of treatment with grand words, where there is not much benefit in any of them;
but I have shortened it according to my understanding, and have fashioned instruments in various ways.
I say that for the gibbosity that comes on the chest in front, there is no remedy nor health;
and also that which comes directly on both sides, and one cannot treat except properly that which comes on the back, as I say;
and the patient should be lying on their face in a level place, and have padding beneath them so they do not injure themselves;
then firmly fix a firebrand in the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a cord beneath the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants hold the cords, one at the head and the other at the feet, across the two firebrands;
and let them be firmly fixed, the firebrands as we have said, and the physician places his palms firmly on the spine until it returns to place.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three cubits long, and dig beneath the wall, and let the patient be on their side, and put the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, you can do this with a winch that is turned by hand. And you should place two firebrands at the patient's head, an arm's length away, and towards the feet two others, and there should be between each firebrand, above and below, a handspan of space in length;
and each firebrand should have a hole through which the winch runs, and the firebrands should be firmly fixed in the ground so that they do not move;
and between each two firebrands there should be a turning bar, around which the ropes turn, and on the two turning bars, two small bars a handspan long, to turn the winch;
and then tie the rope that is through the armpits to the winch towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other winch, and each of the assistants turns his winch with all the rope, and the physician places the spine straight as we have described.
And when it is straight, apply a desiccative plaster with plenty of egg, then the compresses, and then the splint of a small board three fingers long, so that it covers the place of the gibbosity and the healthy part of the vertebra, then tie it with a bandage, as we have said, and the patient should consume a light diet until he is healed;
and if any problem arises at the end of the healing process, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medications, along with the splint that we mentioned previously; and sometimes a piece of lead is applied there, and sometimes the appearance arises in the last vertebra of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation; and it is the bone that is showing, therefore one should not be presumptuous about it: perhaps it would cause death.
Know that at the hip joints and at the shoulder joints only dislocations occur, not like in other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated in four ways: inwards and outwards, and forwards and backwards;
and more inwards than elsewhere, and rarely dislocated forwards and backwards.
And the sign of its inward dislocation is that when the injured leg is placed next to the healthy one, it is longer, and the patient's knee appears higher than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their knee to the buttocks; and the area close by is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the femur comes there.
And the sign of one that dislocates outwards is that these symptoms are opposite to the previous ones.
And the sign of one that occurs forwards is that they can extend their leg fully; however, they cannot bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make them walk, they cannot move forward, and retain their urine, and the groin swells, and when they walk, they step on their heel.
And the sign of the one that occurs backwards, is that they cannot extend or bend their knee, and that leg is more crooked than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is positioned under the ribs.
The reduction of this type of dislocation is such that you consider if the dislocation is old, and it remains fixed in its position, there is no cure; and there should be no attempt (to reduce it).
And in the one where the dislocation is fresh, and it's one of the four types of dislocations, you must hurry to replace the joint, extending it inwards and outwards, and moving it right and left; perhaps it will return (to its place), and no other treatment will be needed.
And if it does not return in this way, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a strap that is tied above the knee; and another assistant should extend his hand from above in such a way that he puts his hands under his armpits, then tightens it with a soft band above the thigh; and another should hold the end of the strap;
and they all extend, upwards and downwards, at the same time, until the patient is lifted off the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to the four types, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is good.
If not, then a treatment appropriate to its type must be applied.
When the dislocation is inwards, you should lay the patient on his healthy side, then place the strap on the root of the thigh, and the place that is below the groin, then extend the strap upwards towards the groin, and towards the navel;
then have another assistant take his arms, and embrace the thick part of the injured thigh, and extend it outwards strongly: it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot fix it in this way that we have described, then you must tie the two feet of the patient together with a strong soft strap on both heels, and on both knees, and the injured leg should be extended two fingers more than the other;
then let him be hung by the top of a piece of wood, and be two arm-lengths above the ground;
then order an assistant to grasp the top of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly grasps the thigh, for the joint will return to its place quickly and suddenly.
And when the dislocation is in the nape of the neck, the patient should lie down as we have described for someone with gibbosity, and tighten a strap on the affected leg firmly, and on the weight as well;
then place two firebrands, one at the head and the other at the feet, then insert a firebrand between the patient's thighs amidst the mold/support; and have wet cloths placed around it, so that it doesn't injure the patient, then each assistant should stretch towards him, and the physician should set the dislocation evenly with his hand.
If it returns (to its place), that is good.
If not, put (him) on a table, and press as we have described for gibbosity, and have the patient lie on their healthy side.
And when the dislocation is forward, one must extend the affected leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and the physician should put his effort on the diseased groin, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is backwards, one should not extend the patient downwards, nor lift them off the ground, but rather they should be as if the hip were dislocated backwards, as we have said about lying on both hips; and (the patient) should be on their face, and the limb extended as we have said previously, and one should press on the joint against the table; and it will be correct when the patient extends their legs, and they are even; then bring the thighs together, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and (the patient) should rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are even, bind it as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and have him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee can be dislocated in three ways: namely, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you ask the patient to bend their leg at the thigh, and if it does not bend at the thigh, you know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all of them is that you have the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and put your back against their face, and put their foot on your feet;
then take their knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then bend both sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends their foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that they can bend their leg at the thigh easily;
and apply the plaster, and bind the leg to the thigh, and tie them together tightly for three or four days, then untie it;
and the patient should not exert themselves to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not aligned, then the assistant applies strong traction, as we have described in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes sprained, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwardly and outwardly.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and leans forward on the side where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should extend it gently with one's hands when it is only sprained.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and an assistant hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left twice, then stretch it upwards, and gently push the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot;
if it returns, that's good;
if not, repeat the procedure, because it will return;
and if it cannot return this way, have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly fix a stake in the ground between their thighs, and tie cloths around it so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with their hands or a cord, that they tie above the ankle; then each assistant extends evenly, and the stake should always be between the patient's thighs to hold the patient steady when extending;
then the physician evenly reduces the dislocation with their hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, apply the plaster and padding on top, and tighten firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves that are on the ankle behind, so that the bandage is not too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage loosens, tighten it;
then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses develop there, you must treat them as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without force, and this is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the back of the foot, you must make the patient sit on a flat surface or on a table, completely upright, and place your foot on the part of the joint that sticks out, then press firmly with your foot, until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing sticks out, place a two-legged table under the sole of the foot, then bind it tightly, and leave it for three days, then untie it; and let him rest until he is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound occurs with the dislocation, and one wants to treat it, it often happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, unless you are wise in the art and you have practiced it for a long time, and unless you are compassionate and merciful and careful, not reckless;
and at the beginning, use soothing things for a hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, then immediately return the limb to its place, before a hot abscess develops there;
and when the limb is in place, then administer things that soothe a hot abscess, and treat the wound, as appropriate, with drying ointments;
and if along with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bone fragments separated, remove them, and do what we have said about simple maladies;
and beware of entering the path of fear, according to what I have said, for this benefits you according to your Creator, and for the safety of your soul and your body.
