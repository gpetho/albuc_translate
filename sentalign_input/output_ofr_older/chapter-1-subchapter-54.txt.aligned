When someone trembles from the coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or another, it is necessary to make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the foot, and one on the stomach with the olive-shaped cautery; this will stop the trembling, and hasten the recovery from the cold disease.	When someone has a tremor, either from chill in a nerve or quartan fever, or from some other cause, you should cauterize him four or five times over the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra, and one on his breast and one on his stomach, with an olivary cautery. Thus the tremor will be stilled and the dispersal of the cold distemper will be hastened.	0.8812823
