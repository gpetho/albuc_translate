 BOOK ONE

[] [1]
 ON CAUTERIZATION

[12] []
But the fire, due to its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except to remove excess. And it is already known to us by experiment and by long service of study in the art on the truth of the causes; and therefore I am excused from the length of the discourse. And if it were not that it is not read in my book, in this I would pause to you a hidden secret with fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and of its expulsion by which it expels diseases, with a demonstrative philosophical discourse, which would be quickened in your minds.

[] [15]
Whereas fire, on the other hand, on account of the nobility of its nature and its superiority has no such effect unless it is overdone.

[] [16]
That has become clear to us by experience through length of service, devotion to the art, and acquaintance with the facts of the matter.

[] [17]
So I need not prolong this discourse.

[] [18]
Were it not inappropriate to this my book I should relate to you a deep secret concerning fire, the manner of its action on bodies and its expulsion of diseases; with a reasoned philosophical discourse too subtle for your understanding.

[23] []
And they said that the place of cauterization does not become rough, though this is not absolutely true, for I have already tested this and found that it does not do this except in some bodies and not in others, and cauterization with it is good and better than with iron as they said; but however, when you make cauterization with fire with gold, it is not clear to you, because it is ignited according to the quantity you want due to the toughness of the gold, and because it is prepared to receive cold; and if you apply ignition on it, the gold melts by the fire, and some layers fall into the fire, by which the artificer falls due to the occupation with it.

[] [31]
They also stated that the site of cauterization does not become purulent, but that is not absolutely so; for I myself have experience of that and have found that it happens in some cases and not in other cases.

[] [32]
Cauterization by gold is indeed better and more successful than with iron, as they have stated; except that when you are heating the gold cautery in the fire you are uncertain, by reason of the redness of the gold, when it reaches the desired temperature.

[] [33]
In addition to this it cools very quickly; and if you overheat it it melts in the fire, melts and runs, and the practitioner finds himself in difficulties.

chapter-1-subchapter-1.txt
[0] []
Of cauterization for head pain due to coldness and humidity.

[] [1]
On the single cauterization of the head.

chapter-1-subchapter-2.txt
[2] []
When in the entire head there is chronic and long-lasting pain and this has been prolonged in the patient, and he uses warm packs, cupping, head purges, poultices, ointments, suppositories, chickens, and the like, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery which we recount and none of those causes provide relief, then consider if the patient's head is of strong constitution in its nature; and it is not fragile and has found great coldness, then cauterize with another cautery a little below that.

[3] []
Then cauterize that on the horn of his head with a cautery until the skin is split.

[4] []
Incise the skin and expose the amount of bone which we have recounted and cauterize it with a cautery on the back part of the head in the place called "vas" â€” and it is that place where cupping is done.

[5] []
And ease your hand in that, and do not expose the bone, because the patient finds much greater pain from that than from any other head cautery.

[] [2]
 When the whole head is affected by chronic headache which has for long vexed the patient, and electuaries, laxatives, errhines, oils, and plasters have been applied; and particularly if he has undergone the single cauterization which we have described, all with no effect, then look well, and if his head is naturally strong of structure and is not weak, and if he feels a vehement frigidity, cauterize him over again a little above the first cautery; then cauterize him on each frontal prominence with one cautery so as to remove the thickness of the skin and expose as much of the bone as we have mentioned above; and burn him with one stroke on the hinder part of the head in the place known as the occiput; but in this cauterization be gentle and do not lay bare the bone; for thus the patient would have intense pain, different from that of other head cauterizations.

And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is visibly manifest, then you must cauterize it with those cauteries we have mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, two cauteries on the cheeks, two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, a large one near the tailbone, one on the elbow, two on the hips, one on each hip, two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the elbows, two on the muscles, two on the soft parts of the chest; and cauterize it on all the joints of the fingers and toes, on each heel, and on the joints of the hands.

[] [6]
If the elephantiasis be widespread over the patient and appears obvious, you should give him, as well as the cauterizations described for the head: one at the end of the nose; two over the cheek bones; two over the cervical vertebrae; six over the dorsal vertebrae; a great one over the coccyx by the last vertebra of the tail; another above that on the flat of the back; two over the hip joints, one on either hip; two on the knees, one on either knee; two over the shoulders; two on the elbows; and two on the upper part of the breast; and burn him once on each joint of his fingers and toes, and on each ankle and on each forearm.

But if the incision is not enough, gradually make deeper incisions without causing any harm.

If it is in such a position that you cannot excise it without cutting through the lid, that will not harm the patient at all.

Then cut with scissors what is left over the iris, from above and below, until nothing remains adhering except over the cornea.

The reason why you must open an abscess near the anus while still unripe, before it is brought to a head, is to prevent it from putrefying the cleft and penetrating to the inner part of the anus and becoming a fistula, and incurable.

So, in the one that you see to be in good condition upon touching, of which the color of what is evident is close to the color of the skin, and it is movable in all directions, and it is not attached to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and it is not deep, it is appropriate that you incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line G to line B, and peel it off completely, and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks if you need them, just as we have said for abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.

[] [5]
But those that you find by touch to be benign and are of a colour not greatly differing from the skin, freely movable in any direction, not adherent to the nerves of the neck nor to a jugular vein, nor to an artery, and are not deep-lying; these should be incised with a simple incision from above downwards, from line g to line b

And the accidental one is according to two ways, one of which is similar to fatty nodules, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by the obstruction of an artery, and in that there is danger.

[6] []
And it is not appropriate to make any attempt on it with iron except in that which is small.

[7] []
And you test it and investigate it with your finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty nodule, and it is not attached to any veins, then you incise it as with the nodes, and extract it with what contains it from the skin and sac; if not, then its whole being is examined, and then treat the site with what is appropriate for healing until it is healed.

[] [5]
The acquired is of two kinds: one resembles a sebaceous cyst, the other resembles the tumour arising from an arterial aneurysm, and it is dangerous to incise it, so on no account must you apply a knife to the latter kind, except any that are small; if you try and explore them with a probe and you find they are like sebaceous cysts and not adherent to any blood-vessel, then immediately cut down upon them as you would a cyst and remove them with whatever capsule may surround them, if they are contained within a capsule; and if not, dissect away the whole accurately; then treat the place with suitable remedies.

Then lift the foreskin slightly and extract the tip of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, because it is better; and sprinkle powder on it and place a cloth on the powder which is spread with moss from a boiled egg mixed with fresh rose oil; and leave it until the next day; and treat it with a cure until it is healed.

[] [14]
Then ligate the indicated place with a double ligature, and a second right round beneath; then take hold at the site of the lower ligature with thumb and forefinger, very firmly, and cut between the ligatures; then quickly push back the skin and draw out the glans penis; then let a little blood flow, for that is all the better and prevents the swelling of the tip of the penis; then wipe it with a piece of soft cloth, then sprinkle on it ashes of dried gourds (this is the best of all that I have tried) or else fine white flour, which is also good; then apply on top of the powders a piece of linen with egg-yolk cooked in rosewater, beaten up with fresh oil of roses of good quality.

And if the urine is not dissolved, and you see that the retention is due to a stone in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be bent over their knees.

[4] []
Then place their feet on their back and stretch their belly from the upper part of their back, and the patient should strain their groin as much as possible.

[5] []
Then the neck of the bladder is constricted, expelling the stone to the back parts, and the urine is released.

[] [3]
When you have carried out treatment in the ways we have prescribed in their place and the urine is not released; and when you see that it is held back by a stone sticking in the neck of the bladder, then you should have the patient down on his knees, squatting; then mount a man on his back to press his abdomen against his back; and let the patient himself hold his breath as tightly as possible; for then pressure will be put on the neck of the bladder to force the stone back and liberate the urine.

[] [12]
The reason why the operation is done in this manner is that the passage by which the urine is excreted is curved.

Then wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that none of the vessels that nourish them can transmit anything, so that no swelling or infection occurs from here.

And place another binding like the first binding, at least three fingers' width away from it; then leave from the sac, which is under the covering of the testicles, an amount the size of a finger, and cut all the remainder circularly, and remove the testicle.

Then take a needle with a stout tenfold thread and enter it near the end of the membrane which lies beneath the skin of the testicles alongside the rupture; then cut the end of the loop of thread to make four sutures and arrange one over the other in the form of a cross; and with these ligate the membrane of which we have spoken with a strong ligature on each side; then twist the ends of the thread and tie them with a strong knot to prevent anything from reaching the nutrient vessels of the testicles, lest an abscess occur thereby; and make also another ligature outside the first one, rather less than two fingers' breadth from it; and after making these two ligatures leave a finger's breadth of the membrane that is beneath the skin of the testicles and cut the rest away round, and with it remove the testis.

And I have already said in the division, when I mentioned the wounds, that every ulcer that is not healed or is not in naked flesh, is so due to one of these reasons: one is either due to a lack of blood in the body; or due to the bad quality of the blood; or because there is hard flesh between the ulcer and the lips preventing the growth of new flesh; or because there is a slight injury; or because the ulcer itself is rotten and the matter sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inappropriate for its treatment; or when corruption falls in the region and it is pestilence; or due to the nature of the region, as in Zaragoza, where it is difficult to digest diseases, and the healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because there is a bone or many bones there.

[] [5]
I said previously in the appropriate section, when I was discussing abscesses, that any ulcer that would not heal nor show growth of tissue was due to one of nine causes.

[] [6]
One is lack, or poorness, of blood in the body; or it may be because the hardness of the tissues, internally and at the edges of the opening, prevents the growth of sound tissue; or it may be because of the abundance of foul and evil matter; or it may be because the ulcer is necrotic in itself and the matter that it discharges is of bad quality; as also it may be because the remedy used in treating it is not suitable; or again it may be because of corruption arising at that locality, of the nature of pestilence; or it may be due to something special and peculiar in the localityâ€”as happens in the city of Saragossa, where diseases tend to linger and tumours are naturally slow to heal; or it may be due to one or more bones in it.

And take consolidative medicines that are placed on the sinus appropriate to what you want, spreading them on linen cloth.

[17] []
And the cloth should be of such a size as to cover the entire sinus; then you cut with scissors at the right of the opening of the sinus a hole slightly wider than the opening of the sinus; then spread another linen cloth with lion ointment according to the size of the hole, and place it over the first in such a way that it facilitates the outflow of discharge from it and does not remove the large cloth but only after a few days.

[] [19]
 As for the consolidating medicaments that are applied externally to the sinus, and the manner of their application: you take one of the ointments suited to your purpose, and spread it on a piece of lint of sufficient size to cover the whole sinus; then with scissors cut a hole in the lint over the mouth of the sinus and a little wider than the sinus opening; then spread on another piece of lint a quantity of softening ointment proportionate to the opening and put the one on the other so that it stands away from the opening of the sinus, in order to ease the discharge of pus from it; and do not remove the larger dressing until after many days.

And those that are according to the members and the parts where they strike are according to two ways: for the members or principal members like the brain, the heart, and the liver, and the lungs, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and their like; and so when it strikes any of these members and it appears to you signs of death, which I will recount shortly, then you must avoid extracting that arrow in those cases where death follows that in the major conditions, and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep in the member, then you extract it and cure the wound.

[] [4]
The difference due to the part transfixed by the arrow is twofold: for there are either the chief hollow organs such as the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs, the kidneys, intestine, bladder, and so forthâ€”when one of these arrows transfixes an organ of this kind, and you observe the signs of death which I shall describe to you later, then you must avoid the extraction of the arrow in that case, for death will generally follow; but when you do not see these fatal signs and the arrow is not quite buried in the depths of the organ, then extract it and dress the wound.

[37] []
And if the arrow is stuck in the bone of the head and has already penetrated into one of the ventricles of the brain, and any of those accidents I mentioned appear in the patient, then refrain from extracting the arrow and leave it until its presence is balanced after a few days; because if the arrow reaches the dura mater, then death is not prolonged.

[38] []
And if the arrow is not stuck except in the body of the bone alone and does not pass into the dura mater, and the patient remains for some days, and none of those accidents occur to him, then you work on extracting the arrow and its extraction.

[39] []
But if it is deeply stuck and does not obey extraction, then you use drills around the arrow as we have mentioned, and then treat the place until it is healed.

There are broad and narrow varieties of it according to the breadth or narrowness of the vein.

[] [52]
This one indicates what the others are like; it is well known to surgeons.

[60] []
But nevertheless, it is necessary for you, in the phlebotomy, to make sure that you do not puncture the muscle head with the phlebotomy tool, and look for the lightest place, and do not harm it, if it is not found with the first percussion, perform the phlebotomy a few times over it.

[] [71]
When you are cutting it you have only to avoid with the scalpel the head of the muscle and to look for the soft place.

The reason is that in some people the blood is multiplied to the extent that they need to extract it by cupping and find heaviness and dizziness in their head; and of those, some find repletion and redness in their face and head, and in their neck; and some find itching in their face and forehead and dimness and dullness in their eyes; and some who vomit the location of their cupping; and some whose laughter is multiplied; and some who find the taste of blood in their mouth, or whose tongue is inflamed and spit blood; and some whose sleep is multiplied, and those who see blood in their sleep as redness and old wounds and other similar causes.

[] [8]
For there are some people who, when there is an abundance of blood in them, so as to need cupping, feel heaviness and pain in the head.

[] [9]
Some find they have a fullness and redness of the face and also of the head and neck; some have an itching in their face and forehead and a dimness and irritation in their eyes.

[] [10]
There are some who scratch the places where the cupping-vessels are applied; some laugh immoderately; some find a taste of blood in the mouth, and the gums swell up and they spit blood; some sleep overmuch; some frequently dream of seeing blood and redness and murdered men and wounds and the like.

And then attach, then equalize and perform decent operation and constriction of that part, and rest and tranquility; warn the patient about this and make them avoid harming it during their waking hours and sleep, and watch their movements and activity, and monitor their excretions, and all their movements with all your ability; and make sure that the position of the part is such that pain is minimized, because when they feel pain or injury due to the position of the part, then you must change it to another position in which they do not feel pain; and ensure that the position is straight and even, so that the part does not become twisted when it is restored.

[] [27]
Then after you have exactly repositioned it and bandaged it, keep that limb still and quiet, and bid the patient beware of moving it while awake or asleep, and in his shifting and stirring, and in opening the bowel, and in every activity, to the utmost of his capacity; and that he should try to let the position of the limb be such that he is free from pain; when pain or distress is felt in any position in which he has disposed the limb, he should move it to a different position in which he feels no pain.

[] [28]
At the same time he should try to make that position even and straight, so that when the limb is mended there be no curvature in it.

However, the binding of the bone when it is without a wound or cut involves applying a plaster made of flour and egg white, covering it with cotton, and placing a pad under the patient's armpit if necessary. Then take a long cloth, like the one used by the Saracens, about a palm wide, and sprinkle doubled powders over the cotton and the plaster. Next, take a thin wooden splint about three fingers wide and of similar length, wrap it in cloth, and then wrap that cloth and splint around the area of the fracture. Bind it securely as described, wrapping it around the patient's neck and under the armpit of the healthy side and the injured side, covering the whole area. This way, the binding of the fracture remains firm and secure, which is not unknown to you.

[] [19]
As to bandaging the bone when it is without wound or incision, it is thus: apply over the bone the plaster composed of mill-dust with egg-white and put over it soft tow; then put a pad in his axilla if necessary; then take a very long sling about a span broad; then place a doubled pad over the tow and plaster; then take a splint made of thin board; its width should be three fingers and its length the same; then wrap it in a rag; then wrap the rag together with the splint in that part of the sling that is over the site of the fracture; then tie the sling round the fracture and wind it round his neck and under his sound axilla and under his injured axilla and carry it several times in every direction as you judge best that the bandaging will hold the fracture firmly, for it will be apparent to you.
