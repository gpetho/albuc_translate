Chapter Sixty-Four.
On the treatment of hydrocele with varicocele.
Varicocele is a tortuous, somewhat twisted swelling, similar to a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.  The treatment of this disease is nearly the same as what has been mentioned previously.
However, it is necessary to describe the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary to sit the patient on a high chair, then push the scrotum downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
And let another assistant hold it and stretch it tautly. Then, with a wide, sharp scalpel, make an oblique incision next to the vessels until the vessels are exposed. Then dissect them from every side, as I described to you in the chapter on dissecting the arteries in the temples. Then insert a needle with a double thread through them.
And tie them at the beginning of the places where the varicocele appears, and tie them also at the end.  Then cut them in the middle with an incision lengthwise along the body, and drain the turbid, corrupt humors that have collected in them.
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for wounds that you want to suppurate so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall off, and there is no harm in that. If the varicocele affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the testicles with the vessels so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment.
Because of cutting off the vessels, it withers and becomes useless.
