when the nose is cut and sewn
Know that when a break in continuity occurs in one of these cartilage structures, little benefits, except in some men.
It is therefore necessary when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it is healed; and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, then you must scrape all the parts of their core until they bleed, then bring the two lips together with a suture, and tighten it, and sprinkle on powder of dragon's blood, and ground incense; and put on the powders a piece of strong plaster or other binding plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suturing is that you bring together the break: either with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the abdomen; or with thread, as I have explained to you.
