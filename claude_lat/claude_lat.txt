Preface.
After I completed this book for you, O Sons, which is the last [book] of medical science with its completion, and I achieved its end through its expositions and explanations, it seemed right to me to complete it for you with this Treatise which is the part about operation, that is, surgery by hand.
Since operation by hand has been laid low in our region, and in our time is entirely absent: until perhaps its science has perished, and its trace has been cut off: and nothing remained of it, except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered: and error and uncertainty befell them, until its purposes were closed off, and its power was diminished: It seemed right to me to revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise according to the way of exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation: and to present the forms of cautery instruments, and other instruments of the work: as it comes from the addition of explanation, and from the hastening of what is necessary.
The reason why a good practitioner of it with his hand is not found in this time of ours, is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author needs to be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the uses of the limbs, and their forms, and their connections, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their exits, and of the pulsing and quiet veins, and their places of exit.
And because of that Hippocrates said, that the name with the name is much, but with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We indeed have already spoken about that in the introduction of this book.
Since whoever is not knowing what we said about anatomy, cannot avoid falling into error, by which men are killed: as I saw many of those, who are formed of this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Which is, because I saw a foolish physician who cut a scrofulous abscess in a woman's neck, and cut certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed, until she fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a man, who had advanced in age, and the stone was large.
He therefore reached it, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And I indeed had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
And I saw another physician, who accepted payment from one of the Dukes of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, that there was a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions, and splints with strong binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he released him according to his desires.
Then he left him for several days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained thus until his leg became swollen, and his foot, and came to destruction.
Therefore I was called to him: and I hurried to loosen the bandage: and tranquility followed, and he escaped from his pains.
However, corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who pierced a cancerous abscess: and it became ulcerated after days, until its malignancy increased with its owner.
Which is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then one should not approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate having all of it cut off.
And because of that, O Sons, it is necessary for you to know that operation by hand is divided into two divisions: namely, operation associated with health: and operation with which there is danger in most conditions.
And I have already warned in every place of this book where an operation occurs in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and leave it alone: so that fools may not find a way to speak and dishonor.
Therefore take measure with care and protection, and your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy success: and leave terrible diseases of difficult healing: and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, lest hesitation enter upon you in your faith and your benefit.
For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your measures.
For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Do not treat a bad disease: lest you be named bad physicians.
I have already divided this Treatise according to three Chapters. ¶

Part I.
¶ On the Benefit and Harm of Cautery: and which complexions it suits, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Chapter I.
But Before Indeed I recall operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its Benefits, and of its Harms: and in which complexion it should be administered.
I say therefore, that discourse on the quality of the benefit of Cautery, and its harm, is a lengthy discourse, and subtle, a science, and a hidden secret.
Indeed many wise men have spoken about it, and disagreed about it: and for me a little of their discourse suffices, fearing prolongation.
I say therefore, that Cautery is universally beneficial for every complexion that is with matter and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
However, regarding the hot and dry complexion with matter, they disagreed.
For some said that Cautery is beneficial in it.
And others said the opposite of this, namely that Cautery is not suitable in illness which is from heat and dryness: since the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness be cured with something hot and dry.
And he who says the opposite of this said: that through Cautery benefit occurs in every hot and dry illness which happens in human bodies: since when you compare the human body, and its humors, to the complexion of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I indeed say through his discourse: because experiment has already revealed this to me several times.
However, none should attempt this unless they have already been tested and trained in the chapter of Cautery with ultimate training, and has known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their symptoms, and their duration.
Concerning the remaining complexions there is no fear upon you: and especially in cold and wet illnesses.
For all physicians have agreed about these: and they have not disagreed about the benefit with Cautery in them.
And know, sons, that from the secret of treatment by Cautery with fire, and its goodness over Cautery with burning medicine is: since fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member that is cauterized: and does not harm another member connected with it, except with small harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the members: and perhaps causes in the member an illness difficult to heal, and perhaps kills.
Fire however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it is excessive.
This has indeed become known to us through experiment, because of long service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I am excused from length of discourse.
And if it were not that it is not permitted in this book of mine, I would bring you a hidden secret about fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses with philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be sharpened by your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree about the time in which it is suitable to perform cautery, and they place the best time as spring.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at any time: because the harm that occurs due to timing is outweighed by the benefit that is drawn from cauterization.
And especially if cauterization is for pains among necessary, severe, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay: because it is feared from them that harm may occur which is greater than the small harm entering because of timing.
And do not let it fall into your minds, O sons, that which only the common people and foolish physicians believe, namely that the illness which is cured by cauterization never returns: and they make this a rule, but things are not as they think: because cauterization is nothing but a substitute for medicine, which alters the constitution and dries up the humors which are the causes why pains occur.
However, cauterization surpasses medicine through the speed of its effectiveness, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the constitution of the sick person, and the location of their illness, and its strength: and what is prepared in their body from the accumulation of superfluities in it: and what reaches it in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from causes, unless it is an illness in which cauterization is administered.
A subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and humors, like cauterization of a tooth for pain, and similar to it, it is indeed possible that that pain may not return in it.
But this happens in few cases.
But again the saying of the common people, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is a correct saying: not in the way that they intend it: since they believe that there is no cure that helps with medicine, nor with anything else after the setting of cauterization.
The matter is actually contrary to that, and the intention that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is nothing but that when we administer modes of treatment in any of the illnesses, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cauterization at the end of the matter, and it helps: then from this it follows that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
The ancients moreover said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say that except because of the evenness of gold, and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that the site of cauterization does not produce pus.
But this is not absolutely true: since I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in certain bodies as opposed to others.
And cauterization with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However when you heat the cautery in fire made from gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated according to the amount that you want, because of the redness of gold: and when cold hurries to it, and if you increase the heating upon it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Therefore the practitioner falls from it into occupation: and because of that cauterization with iron among us is quicker and closer, from correctness to operation.
And I indeed have already arranged this Chapter on Cauterization, according to chapters: and I arranged them from head to feet: so that they might ease for the seeker that which he wants from it.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the Head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
Here cauterization helps against the dominion of humidity and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of headache, and abundance of fluid flow from the head to the parts of eyes and ears, and abundance of sleep, and tooth pain, and throat pain: and universally every illness which occurs from coldness, like paralysis, and headaches, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar things from illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the sick person: that they should be evacuated first with purgative medicine cleansing the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the sick person requires, and their age, and their custom.
Then command him to have his head shaved with a razor.
Then have him sit squarely before you, such that he has placed his hands upon his chest.
Then place the base of your palm above the bridge of his nose between his eyes.
Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the Olive-shaped Cautery: of which this is the form.
Then place it on the spot marked with ink, descending with your hand gradually restrained, and rotate it.
Then lift your hand quickly, and examine the spot.
If you see that a portion of bone the size of an alkiel or a zeuherb has been exposed, then lift your hand.
And if not, repeat with the same iron, or with another if it has cooled: until you see the bones I told you about.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Then place cotton soaked in butter on it, and leave it on the spot until the fire scab is destroyed.
Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it heals.
They have said that the longer the wound remains open, the more pus it releases: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said to cauterize the skin down to the bone: and hold the Cautery until some thickness of bone is burned.
Then scrape away what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that one should proceed with the cautery to the ultimate point, until it makes a strong impression in the bone, so that the bone falls away, which becomes like the form of a carat: or the instrument that women use with a small alphabet infusion: and they believe that vapors of the head are expelled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it consolidates.
However, these two types of Cautery do not seem to me at all except in certain people by way of fear.
And leaving it alone, in my opinion, is better for their safety.
For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity: as we have witnessed in other limbs: and especially when the patient's head is naturally weak: and indeed the first species of Cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore operate with it safely.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the head for pain in the whole head.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head: and it persists in the patient, and he uses hieras, and cochias, and head purgatives, and oils, and poultices.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we described, and none of those things helps him: then consider.
For if the patient's head is of strong natural creation, and is not weak, and he experiences severe cold: then cauterize with another cautery slightly below that one.
Then cauterize him over every corner of his head with the cautery, until it passes through the skin, and exposes bone to the quantity we described.
And cauterize him with one cautery at the back of his head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is the place where the cupping glass is placed: and lift your hand in this, and do not expose the bone.
For the patient experiences because of that severe pain, different from the pain of all other cauteries of the head.
And I will discuss this Cautery in its place: and it is necessary that the cautery, with which the corners of the head and its back are cauterized, be more subtle than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
On the method of cauterizing in migraine, both with burning medicine and with iron.
Chapter 4.
When pain occurs in part of the head and migraine, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is evacuated with medicines that cleanse the head, and the remaining treatment that I mentioned in the division of diseases is administered, and all that does not help: then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with sharp burning medicine or with iron.
Cautery with sharp burning medicine is when you take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Then cut the site of pain at the temple with a broad lancet, until there is a space under the skin in which the clove can be held.
Therefore insert it under the skin until it is hidden: then bind it with a compress with appropriate pressure, and leave it for about fifteen hours then loosen it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterward place cotton soaked in butter on it, until the site produces pus: then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, do this with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, concerning burning Medicines.
But its cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Heat the Cautery, whose form is this.
And it is called Clavilis: because the form of its head is like the form of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in its middle there is a small protrusion.
Then place it on the site, and hold your hand steady: and rotate the iron gradually with speed: and let the amount that is burned of the thickness of the skin be about half of it.
And lift your hand, so that the artery which is below is not burned, and bleeding occurs.
Then soak cotton in salt water, and place it on the site, and leave it for three days: then place cotton with butter: afterward treat with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the second knife-like end of the Cautery.
And beware of cutting the artery in this migraine, especially if not chronic.
On the method of cauterizing in chronic migraine.
Chapter 5.
When you treat migraine with what we mentioned from the preceding treatment, and what we mentioned in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the disease that what we mentioned from the first cautery with medicine or with cautery with fire is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the knife-like Cautery until it becomes white after you mark the site of pain with a line whose length is half a finger or thereabouts: and lower your hand once, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuity of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, lest the side or the nerve that moves it be burned, whereupon spasm occurs.
And be on guard and cautious about the bleeding of the artery which has been cut.
For in cutting it there is danger, especially for one who is ignorant of what he is doing, and is not studious nor experienced: and abandons the operation with it at first.
And I will come with the remembrance of the management of bleeding occurring from the artery according to its method, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the disease that this Cautery is not sufficient for it, and you see the body of the patient tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we narrated, treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the Cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on extraction of the artery with the Cautery having two knives.
For it is better cauterization than this and more beneficial.
On the method of cauterization for ear pain.
Chapter 6.
When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and is treated with solvents, and the remaining treatment which we described in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and this is what is called the Point, whose form is this.
Then puncture with it after heating it around the entire ear, as it revolves: or around both, if the pain is in both simultaneously.
And distance yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with ink: and let the amount of cauterization be ten points in each ear, or thereabouts.
Then treat the areas until they heal.
On the method of cauterization for Facial Paralysis.
Chapter 7.
Facial paralysis which is treated with cauterization is only from the types that occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the division of diseases.
And avoid cauterization of the type that occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this type of facial paralysis with hierae [medicines], and head purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment doesn't help, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little below from its temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
For the softening occurs only in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize with the cautery in line with the upper extremity of the ear slightly below the horn of the head: and another at the temple: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
And lower your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife-like instrument, whose form was mentioned before: however it is not much more subtle than it, as you see: and the knife in it should be slightly more thick than usual.
Then treat the areas with what was previously mentioned: until it heals.
On the method of cauterization in chronic Apoplexy.
Chapter 8.
When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we mentioned, and your medication doesn't help, and the patient doesn't have fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries above every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and a cautery in the back of the head, according to what preceded: and let the method of cautery be according to what preceded.
Also cauterize with a cautery above the mouth of the stomach: and this is most ultimate.
Then let it be treated with what preceded.
On the method of cauterization for Memory Loss.
Chapter 9.
First, the patient should be given great hierae to drink, and pills that purify the brain.
Then shave the patient's entire head, and place on his occiput the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times.
For this is a method of cautery: and do it according to the same order that I described there.
If therefore he is healed by that, it is good.
If not: then make three cauteries in the posterior part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Then treat the cautery with what preceded.
But if you want an addition, and the patient can tolerate it: then make him a cautery in the middle.
And if you want an addition: then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he heals: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form which was mentioned before.
On the method of cauterization in Paralysis and softening.
Chapter 10.
You should proceed in purifying the head with hierae, and with what we mentioned.
Then shave the patient's head: afterward cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of the head, and a cautery above every horn of the head, and a cautery above its posterior part, and three above the vertebrae of the neck.
But if you need more than those in the disease of softening of the body, and the patient can tolerate it, and the disease is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and finish with the cautery, until most of the skin is burned, and lift your hand.
Then treat him until he heals: and thus the olive-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing in Epilepsy.
Chapter 11.
An epileptic person should not be cauterized, except one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Therefore it is necessary that you first cleanse their brain with hierae [herbal medicines], and with the remaining treatment which we mentioned in the division: when the patient is grown, or is tolerant in accepting medicines.
If however it is a child, who does not tolerate medicines, then administer gargling, and chewing substances that cleanse the brain, before that for many days with improvement of foods.
Then shave their head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what was previously described in the method: and with another cautery at the back of the head, and over every corner of their head with a cautery.
But if the patient is strong, and is tolerant, then cauterize them with the cauteries which I described for one having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded.
If however the patient is a child, then apply a fine cautery, according to this method.
On the method of cauterizing in Melancholia.
Chapter 12.
When the causes of melancholia are corrupt humidities and thick phlegm, then cauterize them with the cauteries which we described for one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclining to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give them to drink what will cleanse their brain, according to what preceded in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a properly made circular pad from linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and let the patient sitting square be held from all sides.
Then present the liniment.
And it is most worthy from old sheep's butter.
And heat it over fire with moderate heating to a measure which a finger tolerates when it is inserted into it.
Then empty it in the middle of their head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do that to the patient once every week, with the rest of their good regimen, until they are healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize them making many small points, beyond which you do not hold the hand with the cautery: rather let it be by sensing.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Then place cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat over it.
On the method of cauterizing in water descending to the eye [cataract].
Chapter 13.
When the beginning of water in the eye becomes clear to you through the signs which I mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink what will cleanse their head.
And guard them from all moistures, and make them sit in the bath, fasting for some days.
Then command them to shave their head, and cauterize them in the middle of their head.
Then cauterize them over the two temples with two cauteries, if it is the beginning of water descending in both eyes together: or from one side, if it is the beginning of water in one eye: and cut with the cautery all veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauteries in it be long in the width of the temples: and beware of blood flow.
But if you see any of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them, and caution against blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries ultimately produced.
On the method of cauterizing in Ancient Tears.
Chapter 14.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient, constant: and are over veins and arteries which are manifest externally on the head, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I narrated in the beginning of descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
And if you need addition, then cauterize them on every side of the eye cavity, over the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
On the method of cauterizing for foul smell of the Nose.
Chapter 15.
When you treat it with what we described in the division, and the treatment doesn't help: then hurry, and give the patient to drink for three nights: then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, using an olive-shaped cautery.
Then cauterize it with a nail-shaped cautery using two cauteries, above the two eyebrows slightly under the hair.
And be careful of the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the form of the nail-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing for laxity of the Eyelid.
Chapter 16.
When the eyelid of the eye becomes lax from illness or moisture: then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on each side: and let them be distant from the two temples: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not extend your hand with the cautery, but rather according to the amount that burns a third of the eyelid.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of the crescent-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing the Eyelid when hairs turn inward pricking the eye.
Chapter 17.
Cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cautery with fire: or cautery with burning medicine.
In cautery with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let his hairs grow, if he is among those who trim them, until they become long and even.
If however they prick him at their growth: then bind his eyes with a band, so they don't move, until they grow.
When therefore they grow and become even, then place the patient's head in your lap: then mark on his eyelid with ink, a mark that should be in the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white: or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Then cauterize over the figure which you marked gradually in many passes, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, all visible specifically.
And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye has contracted, and the hairs raised at the point where they prick the eye.
Therefore lift your hand then: and leave it for three days.
Then place Cotton with butter on it, until the scab falls off.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
But if any of the hairs return after a while, and the eyelid becomes lax: then repeat the Cautery over that place, as you did at first.
If however the hairs are in the lower [eyelid]: then cauterize it, until it rises to its natural place: and becomes even so that the hairs don't prick the eye.
On the method of cauterizing with burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter 18.
It is that you should instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they become long and even.
Make from paper or cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, of each one ounce or thereabouts: then grind them together with good grinding, and do this quickly, so that it does not cool.
Then spread this over the paper which you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or both.
And place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white: and let the patient's head be in your lap.
And place your index finger over the medicine, and press it slightly.
And move it whenever the patient feels the stinging of the medicine: for its stinging feels like fire.
While therefore the stinging that he feels persists, then leave the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the stinging subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And observe then, if you see the eyelid rising, as it rises during contraction with fire, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat with the medicine over the same place, where the medicine did not make an impression, and did not blacken, until your operation is even, and the eye contracts.
Then place upon it cotton with butter, until the burnt skin is removed.
Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it heals.
And it is necessary for you during the operation to guard with utmost care, lest anything from the medicine falls into the eye.
But if the eyelid softens after days, and some of the hairs fight in the eye, then repeat the medicine over that place which is softened from the eyelid specifically, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it heals.
And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
And know that people's eyes differ in size, both large and small.
Therefore according to that should be your consideration: and the path of correctness is not hidden from one who has studied this art.
On the method of cauterizing in lachrymal fistula.
Chapter 19.
When you treat a fistula with what we have described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not help: then, it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Command the patient to place his head in your lap, and let an assistant hold his head between his hands in such a way that he does not move, nor shake with his head.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage over his eye: then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be hollow, like the shape of a vulture's feather quill at one end, with which the cauterization is done: and if you wish it may penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it may be held up thus.
However, this hollow one is better for your work.
Then squeeze the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Then place upon it the cautery, which should be very hot.
And hold your hand with it a little while during cauterization away from the eye, toward the nose, so that your hand does not err, or the patient become disturbed: and you place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If therefore you reach in the beginning of your cauterization all the way to the bone, it will be good.
And if not: then repeat the cauterization once, or twice, if you need that: and leave it for three days.
Then place cotton with butter, and treat it with drying ointment, until it heals.
But if forty days pass, and it does not heal: then place upon it sharp corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the ancients have described.
Look to the location of the fistula, and split it open: then place in this split a thin camahan, that is, a thin tube, whose form is this.
And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with the tube with a good grip, and the patient should not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach their eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white, or in water.
For the lead burns the site of the fistula, and heals it with wonderful healing.
If the fistula is healed with what we have described of cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to work on the opening of the nose, and redirect the fistula to the passage of the nose, according to what will come in its own proper place.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in fissures of the Lips.
Chapter 20.
Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called Pili, and especially in the lips of children.
When therefore you treat these fissures with what we have described in the division of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife-like cautery, according to this form.
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of the knife.
Then place it heated quickly in these fissures, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then treat it with wax salve until it heals.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in fistula of the Mouth.
Chapter 21.
When an abscess occurs in the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of teeth: then it makes pus, and bursts: afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and becomes a fistula: then you treat it, and if treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you heat a cautery according to the size that will fit in the fistula.
Then introduce it heated into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the heated iron reaches its depth and its end: do this once, or twice.
Then treat it after that with what we have described of treatment until it is cured.
If therefore the discharge is cut off, and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the area, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come in its chapter.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in Gums and loosened Teeth.
Chapter 22.
When the gum is softened because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it is not effective: then place the head of the patient in your lap.
Then heat a cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place the tube over the tooth: and introduce into it the heated cautery quickly: and hold your hand a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand: then repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
For the loose tooth becomes firm, and the softened gum tightens, and the corrupt moisture dries up.
On the method of cauterizing for tooth pain.
Chapter 23.
When tooth pain is due to cold, or there is cold in it, or a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help: then Cautery for it is according to two methods: either Cautery with butter or cautery with fire.
The cautery with butter is when you take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a vessel.
Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe.
Then submerge it in the boiled butter and place it quickly on the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools: then repeat this several times, until the power of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth: and place a heated iron over it, until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
The cauterization with fire is when you use a bronze tube or an iron tube.
And there should be some thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the Cautery, whose form will come: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the Cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that same day or another day.
And in the application of that Cautery, the patient should fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour: then spit it out.
And this is the form of the Cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish according to what is possible: and this is the form of the Tube.
On the method of cauterizing Scrofula.
Chapter 24.
When Scrofula is from phlegm and from cold humors, and they are not responsive to digestion through medicines, and you want their digestion quickly: then heat a hollow Cautery, whose form is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may exit during Cautery from the other end: and place it heated on the abscess once, and a second time if you need it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small: then apply the Cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place cotton soaked in butter on it, until what the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment until the form of the tube heals.
On the method of cauterizing for hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Chapter 25.
When humors overcome the pulmonary canal, and especially when this is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient first be evacuated with purgative medicines.
Then cauterize them in the depression at the root of the throat: and be careful not to reach the throat with the Cautery, nor in the skin, except a little of it.
Then cauterize them with another cautery at the joint of the neck at its last vertebra finally: and let the Cautery be nail-shaped according to the method that preceded.
Then treat them with what preceded until they heal.
On the method of cauterizing in diseases of the Lungs and Cough.
Chapter 26.
When Cough and disease of the Lungs are from cold humors, and the patient does not have fever, nor consumption, and the disease is chronic: then cauterize them with two cauteries above the collarbone in depressed, smooth, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be tube-shaped according to the form that preceded.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncturing with the cautery which is called Point, whose form preceded in the puncturing for ear pain: and let the points be from thirty points up to about others.
Then treat them with what preceded until they heal.
And now let there be a cautery having three branches: according to this form.
Whereby cauterization is made easier, when you make with it three Cauteries at once.
On the method of cauterizing in the Armpit, in dislocation of the Humerus.
Chapter 27.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to humidity, and is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation, until this becomes a habit of returning, then it dislocates from a small motion that occurs as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation.
Then let the patient lie on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then lift the skin, which is in the inner Armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint dislocates inward.
Then heat a Cautery having two prongs.
Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin, until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, whereby the figure of cauterization then becomes six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the probe.
And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added above this method, whereby there are eight cauteries.
Then place crushed leeks with salt over the cautery.
Then have the patient remain still, so that the limb does not move for some time, until it strengthens.
And if the dislocation is upward, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a nail-shaped cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint becomes firm, and humidity is removed: and the patient is healed.
On the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Chapter 28.
When cold and many humidities occur in the Stomach, until they draw it from its complexion, and catarrhs multiply to it, and you have tried continuous modes of treatment, and it does not help: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery below the breast bone the measure of one finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below from the two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And separate between both so they do not join when they make pus.
And let the depth of the cautery be the measure of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery by which this is done be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing for one who is terrified of this cautery: and it is, that you mark upon the stomach points according to the quantity that you wish with ink: then cauterize it with a point cautery: then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing a cold Liver.
Chapter 29.
When pain occurs in the Liver from coldness and humidity, or from thick windiness, until it departs from its natural complexion in excessive departure, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit in that: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his neck, and you mark with ink three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity over the Liver below the hypochondria, where the elbow of the person reaches: and let the space that is between every cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cautery much.
And let the quantity of what is burned from the thickness of the skin be the quantity of half of it not added: and let the patient be standing on his feet.
If however he is not standing, then let him be lying, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
This is the form of the cautery.
And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-shaped cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And guard yourself, that you do not proceed ultimately in cauterization, and the thickness of the whole skin is burned, whereby the whole body is burned, and it reaches to the intestines: since the skin there is thin, know therefore that.
¶ On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Chapter 30.
When an abscess occurs, and you want to know if that swelling is in the liver tissue or in its membrane: then if it is in the liver tissue, the patient is seized by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the liver membrane, there is severe sharpness with the pain; and you see that its treatment has already exhausted the physicians.
Therefore, the patient should lie back on their neck.
Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then heat the cautery that resembles a rod.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it one cautery until the whole skin is burned and reaches the peritoneum, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for abscesses until it heals.
And one should not use this type of cautery unless one's study in the medical art has been prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have occurred with some experimentation; only then should one dare to perform such an operation.
But to leave it alone is, in my opinion, better.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Chapter 31.
The ancients spoke of cautery with birthwort roots for cold pleurisy in this way.
That is, take from the dried long birthwort roots one of the longer roots that can be found, and let it be about the thickness of a finger.
Then submerge it in oil and light it in the fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery in the area between the joint of the collarbone with the neck, and with two small cauteries below the guidezi slightly inclined to the part below the beard.
And also with two cauteries in the area between the fifth and sixth rib inclined slightly backward; and another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And three cauteries from behind: one between the shoulder blades, and two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be evident on the skin by smell.
And some ancients have said that there are among men those who use an iron cautery similar to a rod: and they heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess itself and the pus comes out, as we said regarding the liver abscess.
But in this perforation with cautery there is the fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no cure.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the Spleen Chapter 32.
When you treat a disease of the spleen with what we mentioned about treatment in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then cautery for it is according to three methods, all of which are correct.
One of which is that you make three or four cauteries in a line according to the length of the spleen following the pattern of liver cauteries, whose form preceded.
And let there be between each cautery the width of a finger, or a little more.
And let the method of cautery be what we mentioned in the liver cautery equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie on their back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you heat a cautery having two prongs, which we mentioned in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and lift the skin that is in line with the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches: and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert the two prongs very hot, until you penetrate the skin with them from the other side: then remove the cautery: thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then treat the cautery after you let it discharge pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than the other treatments that preceded.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Dropsy.
Chapter 33.
Cauterization is not applicable in dropsy, except specifically in ascites.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we mentioned in the classification, and the treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize them with four cauterizations around the navel, and one cauterization over the stomach, and another cauterization over the liver, and a cauterization over the spleen, and two cauterizations behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
And do not cease treating the patient after cauterization with this: for it is necessary that two intentions be combined for him: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be nail-shaped: according to its previous form: and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped according to its previous form.
On the Method of Cauterizing Feet and Legs.
Chapter 34.
When they swell in a dropsical patient, and are filled with yellow water: you should cauterize over the top of the Foot in the nocrati, which is between the little finger and the ring finger: and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then lift your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will seep out, and let the cautery be according to this form.
Then make two cauterizations on the two legs on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-edge of the cautery: and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower than it, around the middle of the leg: and two cauteries on each hip: and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time: so that some of the water may seep out: then treat it with the remaining things we mentioned.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Looseness of the Bowels.
Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and moistures, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers, which are in the stomach and intestines: and this is treated with methods of treatment, and is not cured: and you see the patient able to tolerate cauterization of abundant strength, then cauterize them with a large cautery over their stomach, according to what preceded in cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauterizations around the navel, with a small nail-shaped cautery: and a cautery over the lower back above the sacrum large, or with two cauteries.
And if you see abundant moistures, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize them with a cautery over the pubic region, and a cautery over each flank: and perhaps you may add two small cauteries over the stomach near the large one.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not fail.
On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter 36.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupt moistures, and they are treated with what we mentioned in the classification, and the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauteries over the lower vertebra of the back below the coccyx a little in a triangular pattern, and with a cautery below the navel about two fingers' width.
And if you think that their stomach has become cold, and their food is not being digested, and you see their face swelling, then cauterize them over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and with a cautery over their Liver, and another over their Spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat them until they are healed.
On the method of cauterizing althelul (hemorrhoids) after cutting them off.
Chapter 37.
When you cut off the althelul, then heat a cautery that resembles a rod.
Then insert this heated instrument into the cut althelul: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
If therefore there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Then treat them with whatever ointments benefit them until they heal.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the hip, it is most effective in helping.
On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38.
When the patient does not submit to the incision and procedure which we described in its place, and is frightened of it, perhaps he can be healed with cautery.
When therefore someone develops a fistula, and it becomes chronic, pus flows from it, and corrupted fluids.
Therefore what is most proper is to probe it with a fine probe.
Then determine the depth of it with the probe.
Then heat a cautery which is similar to a rod.
Then insert the heated instrument into the fistula to the same depth that the probe entered.
And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupted tissues are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
And guard yourself from burning a nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the area until it heals.
If however the area seals up, and the discharges cease from it, and it remains so for a long time: then know that it has healed completely.
And if the discharges do not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is corrupted bone, or something like that among those things: mention of which will come in its place.
On the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
Chapter 39.
When pain occurs in the Kidneys from cold, or from thick wind, and because of this the patient's strength diminishes, then you should cauterize him over the back over the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over each kidney with a nail-shaped cautery, mention of which came before.
And perhaps we cauterize him a second time in the same place.
Wherefore three lines will come.
Therefore they will be most effective in helping.
On the method of cauterizing the Bladder.
Chapter 40.
When weakness occurs in the Bladder, and softening from cold and moistures, until the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize him in the lower part of the abdomen over the Bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and with a cautery on the right side of the abdomen, and another on the left of it: and let the length of that lateral cauterization be according to the size of the thumb joint: and cauterize him with a cautery on the lower back, or with two cauteries, if you need that: and let it be according to what preceded with the nail-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing the Womb.
Chapter 41.
When cold and moistures occur in the Womb, and because of this she is prevented from becoming pregnant, and her menses are corrupted, and their onset is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is proper that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery over the hip lower on the back, or with two cauteries: and let it be a nail-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing the Hip in dislocation.
Chapter 42.
When mucous humors flow into the hip socket, and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg becomes longer than the other when they are compared: and the site of dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore you should cauterize the patient on the hip socket itself with a circular cautery: after you mark with ink around the socket, as it revolves: and so that the socket itself falls in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form that was previously described in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat it until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing in Sciatica.
Chapter 43.
When pain occurs in the hip socket, and cold and humors are the cause of it: and the patient is treated with what we described in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then you should free the patient from thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar ones.
Then cauterize him.
And the method of cautery in it is according to two modes: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cautery with fire is according to many modes.
One of which is that you cauterize above their hip socket with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them of good depth, or bad.
And let the space between each cautery be the width of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes the cautery is made in the middle over the head of the hip itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with a circle, whose form was previously described in the cauterization of hip dislocation, one: so that the circle contains the entire hip.
And burn through the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery in Sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place where the patient indicates there, where the pain is, and with your cautery above the ankle four fingers toward the outer part slightly: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the skin's thickness.
But if the patient indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes of the foot, then cauterize there where he indicates with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if that is needed.
And if he indicates the pain is below the knee toward the leg, then cauterize there with one knife-shaped cautery.
And in all your cauterization, beware that you do not go so far with the cautery as to burn a nerve, or a major artery, and thereby bring upon the patient severe harm, or contraction.
And I indeed have seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in cauterization, and the leg swelled up, until the swelling reached the foot, and it was all perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then diarrhea occurred, and death after that.
If the pain is in both parts simultaneously, cauterize both according to this method.
And certain wise men spoke about cauterization of the hip, whose cautery is of this mode.
Make an iron similar to a forceps, whose diameter should be half a palm: and at its opening it should be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less: and within that forceps should be a third forceps.
And let the space between each forceps be the size of a thumb joint: and let the forceps be open on both sides: and let their height be about one joint, or two joints: and make them an iron handle properly fitted to the forceps.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in fire until it becomes red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed over the hip socket with the patient lying on their healthy side.
So cauterize it with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave it for three days.
Afterwards dress it with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Albucasis said, "O my sons, we have used this type of cautery little, because of its terrifying appearance: and because we find few who can endure it.
However, it is among the good cauteries for one who can bear it, and finds relief with it.
The cautery with burning medicines is done thus: you make two curved pieces having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge of its gate made of bronze or iron, the length of the wall: in their height there should be two knots, or something like them.
And let the space between both be the width of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let them hold together, according to this form.
Then place it over the hip socket, with the patient lying on the healthy side.
And press your hand firmly over the hip socket.
Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated somewhat with fire, and hold it for about an hour: and let the patient endure its biting and burning, for he will feel a biting like fire, until the biting subsides.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and clean off the hot water from the entire hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will flow from it.
For this is ultimate in benefit.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg: make for it a vessel containing water, just as you did for the hip in the same way.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the preparation of medicines.
Take alkali and unslaked lime, one part each: grind both and put them in a new pot whose bottom part is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that a rod might enter it: and place under the bottom of the pot another glazed pot: and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water that covers both by a finger's width: after you compress them well with your hand: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glazed pot.
Then collect all that water and pour it over other lime: and strain until it is renewed.
For it will then be of very strong sharpness, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterization of other limbs.
Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
And among the medicines with which the hip is cauterized are also like euphorbias, and cashew honey, and lime with soap, such that both are mixed. ¶
And Galen indeed reported in narration a certain ancient man's cure, by which hip pain and sciatic vein were treated: and he greatly praised its effectiveness.
And he said that he needed no other treatment, and that he was cured in one session, until he reported that he perhaps entered the bath carried and left it already healthy.
And it is thus: take green seitaragi: and if green is not found, take dry, fresh: and grind it well with some fat, and place it on the hip where there is pain, or leg, or in the thigh: and bind it, and leave it for about three hours, or for the time until the patient feels relief from the burning.
Then bring him into the bath.
When therefore his body becomes dewy, put him in the tub.
For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines except after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides indeed said that when goat dung is used to cauterize the sciatic vein, it helps it: and the cauterization is done in this way.
Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep spot which is between the toe of the foot and the shin bone, and is closer to the shin bone.
Then take dried goat dung, and inflame it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Then repeat that.
Do not cease doing this until the sensation reaches through the middle up to the hip, and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the Bovine cautery.
¶ On the cauterization of Back pain.
Chapter 44.
Sometimes pain occurs in the Back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and wet material: and cautery indeed is only applicable in this single type, which occurs from the infusion of cold material.
Therefore after evacuating the patient with foul pills and similar things, it is necessary that three lines be made over the Back where the pain is, according to the width of its medial part, after you mark with ink in every line five cauteries, or more according to the amount that comes from the patient's tolerance of his strength: and let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a medium nail-shaped cautery, according to this form.
¶ On the method of cauterizing at the beginning of Hunchback.
Chapter 45.
This illness often occurs in small children.
And the sign of its beginning in children is: that constriction occurs in their breathing during elevation and movement: and you find in the last vertebrae of the Back and its nodes, that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore when you see that, and you wish to do it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular according to this form.
And let the cautery take hold equally over every part of the vertebra: and if you wish cauterize around the vertebra with a point cautery in two or three lines: and let the points be close to each other.
Then treat the area until it heals with what we have mentioned.
And beware, do not apply cautery in hunchback which occurs in nerve spasm.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in Gout and pains of the joints.
Chapter 46.
When joint pains are from cold humidities, which are poured out to any members of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name that specifically Gout.
Therefore when Gout of cold cause is treated with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is that you cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be Olive-shaped.
This is its form.
And if you need to make points on the surface of the foot, then do it with a point cautery.
But if the pains ascend up to the knees, or other joints, and this often occurs, then cauterize above every knee with three or four cauteries on every side, with this same nail-shaped cautery.
If however more than this cautery are necessary for you, then cauterize it.
And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If however the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we said about cautery in its chapter.
But if the pains are in the hands only, then make points around the arm bones, as two lines revolve.
If however pain remains in the fingers, then make points over every joint a point, and over the back of the hand.
If however the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both on every side.
And do not empty the patient from good regimen, from the receiving of medicines.
For if good regimen is maintained, and phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with God's help with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Chapter 47.
When a Rupture occurs in the groin, and intestine or omentum descends to the testicle, and it is in its beginning stages and nearby: then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to stop eating on that day.
And he should use laxatives, by which stool may descend from his belly.
Then he should sit before you on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath, until the omentum or intestine comes out or appears.
Then return it with your fingers, and mark with ink below the Rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose end is similar to half a circle toward the upper body.
Then heat the cautery, which is of this form, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Then return the intestine or omentum to its cavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand over the spot, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the patient's legs, and placed a pillow under him, and another servant is on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery on this mark, your hand holding the cautery straight.
And hold it until you reach bone with it: or repeat with it a second time, if you did not reach the bone with it on the first try.
And carefully watch for the exit of intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and through that either death or great harm comes upon the patient.
And know that when you do not reach bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be thin, according to their size.
Then treat with the remaining ointments until it heals.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound seals.
And it is necessary that you arrange his nourishment throughout the duration of his treatment to be that which loosens his belly: so that the intestine does not come out during straining and defecation.
Then when he wants to rise after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
And let him reduce labor, and fullness of food and drink, and violent voices.
For when he follows this regimen, he is thus healed with complete healing.
And I will describe the treatment of Ruptures with incision in its chapter.
When however Ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and they are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize its Rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be like a third of it.
Then treat it with what we have mentioned: and it will not increase.
And some of the ancients have already said: that the Rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which goes across the upper side of the Rupture, and another line to the lower part.
And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to falls or blows.
Chapter 48.
When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow: and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is not effective: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a Point cautery.
And let the cautery of each limb be a cautery according to its size and its smallness, and its weakness and its strength, and the location of the twisting and pain in it.
If therefore it heals from the first cautery, it is well.
If not: then repeat the cautery on it.
For it is the habit of these pains to move from one limb to that which is near it.
Therefore it is necessary that you follow them with the cautery until the patient is healed.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Leprosy.
Chapter 49.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with the greatest benefit.
And especially the type of Leprosy which occurs due to putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: when therefore you wish to cauterize it, consider the following.
If therefore the Leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it neither descends nor stays: and you fear for the patient that corruption might overtake his entire constitution: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the known head, and a second lower towards the forehead near the hairline, and two above the corners [of the forehead], and one behind on the nape of the neck.
And [apply] your hand with the cautery gradually, until it makes a small impression in the bone, and scales are displaced from it: so that the expiration of thick vapors from it is relieved, and also cauterize with cautery over the spleen, according to what was previously stated.
But if the Leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries which we mentioned in the head, and with cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two jaws, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the coccyx near the tail bone and one above it, in the same sacral region: and two on the hips: namely one on each hip, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the tender parts of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint of the joints of his hands and feet: and cauterize on every heel of his feet and the bones of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with cautery over the pubic bone, and another over the stomach bone, and another over the liver.
And know that the more cautery you add, the greater the benefit and the more helpful it is.
And know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery as healthy people feel it: because his body has already become numb.
And the cauteries should be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to what was previously stated about the types of iron instruments.
Then treat the cautery with vetch flour with honey, and the remaining treatment, until it heals.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Numbness.
Chapter 50.
When any limb becomes numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb itself with cauteries, according to what the size of the limb or its smallness deserves.
And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes it is cauterized for certain numbness, which occurs in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves, which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume to do this unless they are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of the nerves moving the body.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Vitiligo.
Chapter 51.
When vitiligo becomes chronic, and nothing from medical treatments helps in it: then cauterize over it with a somewhat deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Then treat it with vetch flour and lentils with rose oil, and plantain leaves, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: of each take one part: mix all these, and spread them on a cloth, and apply to the place until it heals.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Cancer.
Chapter 52.
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it revolves.
The wise ones however said to cauterize with a final cautery in the middle.
This does not seem right to me: since I fear that it might ulcerate: and I have already seen this several times.
And it is more correct to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said: or with many cauteries.
On the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Chapter 53.
When someone has Adubelati, and it is slow to mature, either due to excess matter causing it, or due to the age of the patient, when he is decrepit with little blood, or due to timing, and you wish to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around its circumference with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this form.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which the patient follows, so that the flow of pus may be relieved.
Then treat it until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing in corrosive disease.
Chapter 54.
Corrosive disease is nothing but corruption moving in a limb, and it corrodes it: like fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see corrosive disease in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat many cauteries, small and large nail-like ones, according to what is suitable for that place where the corrosive disease is.
Then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate all corruption, and nothing remains of it at all.
Then leave it for three days, and place ground sulfur with oil over the cauterized areas, until all scabs and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days flesh grows with healthy growth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then repeat the cautery over what remains of the corrupted areas.
And corrosive disease is sometimes treated with sharp medicine.
For it rises in place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of swifter benefit: and I indeed have already spoken about its cauterization with sharp medicine in the division: therefore take it there when you need it.
On the method of cauterizing in Nails and Warts.
Chapter 55.
Many times this illness occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, compacted thing, which harms the foot.
And cautery indeed in these is according to two modes: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for with fire, it is that you heat a concave cautery similar to a vulture's feather: which should be made of iron, of such size that it contains the nail from all sides: and it should have thin edges.
Then place it heated over the nail.
Then rotate your hand with the cautery around the circumference of the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Then plaster it with wild mallows, ground with salt: and leave the plaster on it overnight.
For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the area with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
But if they are not converted, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer in them cautery with hot water: that is, take a small tube of brass, or iron, or from a vulture's feather: and place it over the nail, or althelul.
Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand, and rotate it with compression of your hand a little, so that the edge of the tube is impressed in the root of the nail, and the hot water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait a little over the stinging of the hot water for one hour.
Then leave it, for the nail will be eradicated with its roots.
Do thus with them one after another, until you come upon all of them that are in the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from the ointments.
On the method of cauterizing for Tremors.
Chapter 56.
When someone experiences tremors from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize them with four or five cauterizations above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on their chest with a cautery, and above their stomach with a cautery.
Indeed, tremor subsides with olive-shaped cautery, and healing of cold illness hastens.
On the method of cauterizing Albathir [pustules].
Chapter 57.
Sometimes foul Albathir appear on the body, that is, pustules, which form from thick corrupted matter.
Therefore it is necessary when they first appear, that they be cauterized above every pustule head with a fine cautery using myrtle wood, whose end is lit with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes ademenul are cauterized, at the beginning of their emergence according to this method: and they do not increase: and the excess causing them breaks open, and is healed from these.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation through bloodletting.
On the method of cauterizing for blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Chapter 58.
Often blood flow occurs from an artery which is cut near a wound that happens externally, or near the incision of an abscess, or cautery of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
When therefore this happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger over it: and press it firmly, until the blood is contained under your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Then place small and large olive-shaped cauteries, several in number, in the fire: and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and location where the artery is torn, and place the cautery on the vein itself, after you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood stops.
If it spurts out when you lift your finger from the artery opening, and the cautery cools, then quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire.
Do not cease doing this with one after another, until the blood stops.
And take care not to burn the nerve that is there, lest another misfortune befall the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it: especially when the artery is large, except by one of four methods.
Either with cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
For when it is extracted, its ends contract, and the blood stops.
Or it may be tied with thread in a strong binding.
Or medicines may be placed over it whose property is to stop blood, and it may be compressed with a cushion with proper pressure.
But he who attempts to stop it with bandaging, and tightening with cloth, or placing burning things and similar items, it helps him not at all, except rarely.
If however this happens to someone, and no physician or medicine is present: then let him begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and pressing it very firmly, until the blood is contained from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
And the finger should not be removed, [but] pour very cold water over it continuously, until the blood congeals, and thickens, and stops.
And meanwhile consider what is needed from cautery or from medicine.
End of Part One.
Surgical Book of Albucasis Part II.
¶ On Incision, Perforation, and Bloodletting in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already spoken in the First Chapter about every illness in which cauterization with fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauterization.
And I have placed chapters there from head to foot.
And I shall proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the search may be made easier for the seeker.
And before I begin it, you should learn, O sons, that in this chapter there is as much terror as there is in the first chapter about cauterization.
And because of that it is necessary that caution in it be more vigilant, since in the operation which is in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands, during the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a swelling, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision for a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and in many of them death occurs.
And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation should fall upon you, for sometimes in this art types of men come to you with types of infirmities.
Among them is he who becomes angry with his illness, and death is light to him: because of the severity of what he finds from his infirmity and the length of its malice.
And with the illness there is fear which signifies death.
And among them is he who gives you his wealth, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, while his illness is fatal.
Therefore you should not consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be more vigilant than your desire and your greed.
And do not presume upon anything from that, except after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which praiseworthy success leads.
And use in the treatment of all your patients, prognosis and indication of that to which health suitably follows.
For in that there is help for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire in you, O sons, His understanding, and not take away from you guidance and inspiration: since that is in His hand.
And indeed I have arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from neck to feet: so that the quest which you want from it, and which you need, may be made easier for you.
¶ On the treatment of Water which collects in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife squeezes the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this illness in others than in children: and death hastened to all of them whom I saw: therefore because of that it seemed to me better to abandon operation in it.
And indeed I saw among them a child, whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit up by himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
And indeed this moisture either collects between the skin and bone: or collects under the bone over the membrane.
And the operation in that, if the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, then it is necessary that you make in the middle of the head one incision in width: and let the length of the incision be about two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of the spatula.
If therefore the moisture has increased more, and the swelling is larger, then make these two incisions, according to this form. 
And if moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from all sides: and the water is depressed when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and this is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this way. 
And after the incision extract all the moisture. 
Then bind the incisions with cloths and small pads. 
Then foment it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day. 
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with probes and ointments. 
And do not cease to bind the head evenly. 
And feed the patient every dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed. 
And another method of incision is that you observe where the size of the swelling appears, and the collection of water. 
Since sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the sinciput, or on the right, or on the left. 
Therefore ascend with the incision where the swelling and fullness of water appears to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you. 
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and bleeding occurs, and the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture. 
¶ On the Incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter 2. 
When catarrhs occur to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and this becomes chronic, and treatment with medicines does not help: then the most ultimate treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries. 
Therefore it is necessary when you wish to cut them, that the patient shave his head. 
Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear. 
Then let the patient bind his neck with whatever cloth of his. 
Then observe where the vein pulses. 
And the locations of both are the depressed places which are behind the ears: and rarely is it hidden, except in certain men. 
Then mark with ink over both: and cut both with a double-sharp spatula, with an incision reaching to the bone: and let that be done across the width of the head. 
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and cut it upwards with an incision. 
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers. 
For when the vein is cut, blood exits in a pulsing manner, which leaps inward with frequent jumping. 
If however the artery does not appear to observation, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the space of three fingers. 
Then mark with ink, and cut until reaching the bone. 
And that which is necessary to emit of blood is 6 ounces and perhaps you emit more or less from it. 
All that according to the amount which appears to you from the patient's strength and the fullness of his artery. 
Then attend to the wound. 
Then if anything remains of the membrane at the bone, then cut it, so that a hot swelling does not occur: then bind the wound with linen cloth strips. 
Then treat it with ointment, until it heals.
On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Chapter III. 
When a person suffers from chronic migraine, or acute catarrhs due to sharp humors, and heat in the muscles of the temples, or chronic severe headache, and similar conditions: and when treated with methods of medical treatment, and it does not help: then we have tested in these illnesses the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described. 
And the method of operation in extracting them is that the patient should shave the hairs that are on the temples, and attend to the visible artery in the temple. 
For it shows itself to you by its pulse, and rarely is hidden except in few people, or in extreme cold. 
But if it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind his head with any of his cloth: then rub the area with a rough cloth. 
Or steam the area with hot water, until it appears to you with clear appearance. 
Then take the spatula, which I formed a little while ago. 
Then carefully strip the skin with it until you reach the artery. 
Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upward until you extract it from the skin, and make it free from the membranes that are beneath it on all sides. 
If the artery is thin: then wrap it with the end of the hook. 
Then cut a portion of it according to the length by which its ends separate and contract, and bleeding does not occur. 
For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, blood does not rise at all. 
Then drain from the blood six ounces, up to three. 
If the artery is large: then you must tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk: or with strings of gut, so that decay does not hasten to it before the wound consolidates, and bleeding occurs. 
Then cut off the excess that is between the two ligatures. 
Do that in that hour, or after another hour. 
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife-like cautery: until its ends are cut, and it will remain in place of the same operation. 
And it is the better procedure, unless the patient has fever, or is of hot complexion. 
Since cautery is among those things that help to end humidities. 
Therefore it is the better aid. 
And after the extraction of arteries, it is necessary that the place be filled with old cotton: and properly made compresses be placed upon it. 
And after loosening treat with dry medicines, which make flesh grow, and with lint pledgets, until it heals. 
But if meanwhile while you are operating bleeding occurs from the artery, then hasten to stop it with cautery, or to fill the place with vitriol: and press your hand, until the blood stops. 
But if none of those things is present with you, then place your finger over the place, until the blood congeals. 
And bathe the place with very cold water, until the sharpness quiets, and it is bound as necessary. 
And among what is lighter and easier than extraction of the artery, is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to almagdatem. 
However they are of much less sharpness than two knives. 
For if they are sharp, like two knives, cold hastens to both: and they do not cut flesh quickly. 
When therefore there is some thickness in them, the heat of fire is retained in them, and flesh is cut quickly: with this therefore the procedure is better than every procedure, and lighter, and easier. 
And let the space that is between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink: and set both down very hot, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its ends separates. 
For they do not consolidate at all with this cautery. 
And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ On the treatment of constant acute tear flow from the eyes.
Chapter 4.
When tears are constant, and their flow is from the veins that are on the outside of the skull of the head: and no medical treatment with medicines helps them, and you see the patient's face becoming red, and he feels in his forehead a movement, like the movement of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their eyelashes have been eroded with corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of tears: then the ancients needed this operation in treating them, and they called it treatment with the Sword.
And it is that you should order the patient to shave the hair that is on his forehead.
Then make three equidistant incisions in the forehead according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be about two fingers, and let one incision be parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length slightly away from the movement of the muscles, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on the two sides: and keep your hand away from the connection of the two jaws, and let the space of each incision be the width of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dried cloths, with which to dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose form follows next.
From the incision which is on the side of the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with the membrane that is over the bone.
Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp knife, sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side toward the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side toward the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision should not continue up to what appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after an equal amount of blood has flowed, squeeze the areas to remove pieces of clotted blood.
Then place in every fissure a wick of old cotton, and place over them compresses soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar.
And see that no hot inflammation occurs.
And on the third day loosen the bandage, and apply plenty of infusion with lukewarm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment and the other things with which wounds are treated: until it heals.
¶ On the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the interior of the head.
Chapter 5.
When someone experiences acute, sharp, constant catarrhs: and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their sight has already been weakened: and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and in the depth of the head there is sharp, harmful pain, and consequent sneezing: then take from these symptoms, that those materials and catarrhs come only from many veins.
And the best treatment for them is this.
And it is that you should order the patient to shave his forehead.
Then make one incision in it in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to the other side across the width, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be down to the bone: and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples, which move during chewing: until when the bone is exposed: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton, or with linen wicks.
Then bind over it with compresses: and soak the compresses with wine and oil, so that no hot inflammation occurs.
And when you loosen it, and you see that the hot inflammation has already diminished: then it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that makes flesh grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony: and prepare from them a plaster, and let it be administered for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
On the treatment of what falls into the Ear.
Chapter 6.
Everything that falls into the Ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone, or something similar to stone, like iron and glass; or it is from a plant, like chickpeas and beans; or it is a flowing substance, like water and vinegar and similar things; or some animal. 
When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or a type of stone from those which neither expand nor grow in the ear, expose the Ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then drip into the Ear something from violet oil, or sesame oil. 
Then administer its extraction, and cause sneezing with condisi, and block the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear upward. 
Many times indeed it comes out with this treatment. 
If however it does not come out, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, fine tweezers: whose form is this. 
If therefore it comes out with tweezers, it is good. 
And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine blunt hook of little doubling. 
If therefore it does not come out by that means, then make a tube from bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal deeply, and block what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there is no path for air except through the tube: then extract with your breath by strong suction. 
Many times indeed it comes out with what we have described. 
If however it does not come out this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it on the tip of a probe after you wrap it with cotton properly positioned: then insert it into the ear canal with care, after you dry the ear from moisture. 
If therefore it does not come out with all that we have described, then hurry to cut, before a hot abscess occurs, or spasm. 
And the method of cutting is that you first bleed the patient in the cephalic vein: and draw blood from him according to the measure of his strength. 
Then have the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fatty part in the depressed place there: and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you. 
Then sew the incision immediately with speed, and treat it until it heals. 
But if the thing falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell: then administer its extraction. 
If however it does not yield to you for exit, then take a thin, fine spatula, according to this form. 
And administer with it the cutting of that type of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do that when you think that grain has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you make it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with fine tweezers, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is made easier. 
For water however which enters the ear, it is necessary that the patient use sneezing with condisi first: and he has already filled his ear with some old cotton: and he is lying on that ear in which the water is. 
If therefore it comes out by that means, it is good. 
And if not: then take many stones, the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire a little, and let the patient insert one of them into his ear canal: and let him hop on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear. 
Therefore he should not cease doing that with stone after stone, until all the water comes out. 
And water indeed comes out so that you take from papyrus, or from reed one piece, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until most of it burns. 
Then repeat with another reed, and do that many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a tube according to what was described previously for the stone.
In extracting small animals that enter it (the ear), if it is of small body, like a flea or similar, treat it as I described in the division. 
But if it is of large body, which is visible to the senses: then perform its extraction with forceps and hooks: and this matter is easier than all things that are held in the ear. 
In extracting a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we described in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you should examine the ear in sunlight. 
If therefore something appears there from the worms, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks. 
If however nothing appears there, then take a small tube, which has this form, narrow below, wide above: and insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate: then suck with it using strong suction. 
Do this many times, until all worms come out. 
If however they do not yield to you for exit, then seal the circumference of the tube with wax, as I said regarding the stone. 
But if they do not come out with what we described: then administer the distillations which the ancients have already tested in killing worms: and you will find that in the treatise on distillations. 
And let your pouring with which you pour oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. 
As you see make it from silver, or bronze, narrow below, in which there should be a small opening, wide above. 
Therefore let the plunger which is in the cavity of the tube be made appropriately from bronze. 
And if you wish, take a probe, and wrap cotton at its end with a proper wrapping: then pour the oil, or juice, or whatever you want from these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then insert the probe with cotton from above, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is forced into the cavity of hearing, and the patient feels it inside: and let that which is poured into the ear be already slightly warmed with fire: and take care that the thing which is distilled into it is not very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
On the treatment of blockage occurring in the Ear.
Chapter 7. 
Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs with [ears] not perforated.
And blockage in the ear canal also happens to some people from a wound, or flesh growing in it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear hole, which sight cannot reach: and sometimes it occurs near the exterior of the hole, and sight can reach it.
Therefore that which occurs deep in the ear, and which sight cannot comprehend, is in most cases difficult to cure.
And for that which sight can reach, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look into it: then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a thin spatula, whose form follows here, let its tip have some small width, of which some part should be sharp: and let the rest of the spatula have two smooth sides: so that it does not harm the ear. 
If therefore the blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal: then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it with careful force, until all the flesh is removed.
But if the blockage is deep in the ear: then take a thin, smooth probe, and heat it slightly with fire: then insert it into the ear canal.
If therefore you sense the blockage with it, which the patient finds with difficulty of hearing, attempt to open it carefully: and beware, lest you wound the ear nerves.
Then place in the ear a lint according to the size of the hole's width, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days, until you are assured of the wound's healing.
Or take lint, and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle ground vitriol over it, and use it. 
If you see the ear becoming infected: then you should remove the lint, and replace it with another lint, which you will wrap in a wax preparation made with rose oil, until the hot inflammation subsides: then treat it until it heals.
But if bleeding occurs: then submerge a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place them over that ear: and use the remaining treatment, which stops bleeding as described in the treatise on distillations. 
On the treatment of warts of the eyelids.
Chapter 8. 
These warts that occur on the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist, and are dry.
Therefore you should hold them with forceps: or with a hook, and cut them with a spatula from their roots.
Then place ground vitriol over the areas.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
And cauterizing them is better after incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and do not return. 
On the treatment of Hailstones of the eye's eyelids.
Chapter 9. 
Often occurs in the eyelids something that resembles Hailstone in its hardness, and its firmness, and because of that it is called Hail: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid, and lower eyelid.
Therefore the operation on them is, that you should consider then, if it is Hail proceeding in what appears of the eyelid, and they move to every part, and its matter is easy.
Therefore make an incision over it lengthwise.
Then carefully excise it from all sides until it comes out.
Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
But if its removal is not possible for you, except after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the patient somewhat.
But if the incision is large: then bring it together with sutures: and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it, and makes it heal.
And if the hail is declining toward the interior of the ear toward the inner surface, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the hail with a hook: rather than needing incision, and press it from all sides.
But if the eyelid is elongated by the incision, that does not harm in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the hail, with salt water: and treat the area with that which heals, until the patient recovers.
On the treatment of Axirnath of the eyelids.
Chapter 10.
Axirnath is a fatty substance that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid: and indeed it occurs mostly in children: and it weighs down their eyes, and they get catarrhs in the mornings, and they cannot look at sunlight, because tears come quickly to them, and because of this you see them always lying on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, which swelling has already covered: and indeed the prominence of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them. 
And the method of operating on it is that the patient should place their head in your lap. 
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare strips from it, and make from that strip a circle according to the size that contains the Axirnath from all sides. 
Then place it over it, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle. 
Then make an incision in the middle of that moisture with a cutting spatula, making cuts across the width, and let the incision not be deeper than what is made in phlebotomy. 
Either it is necessary that you cut the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath for in many cases the Axirnath comes out of the incision in the form of a piece of white fat. 
Therefore extract it with a cloth, which you have worked between your fingers toward the outside: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it disperses: and take care not to deepen the incision, lest you reach the eye with the spatula and harm it. 
If however the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should deepen the incision a little bit carefully, until the Axirnath comes out. 
Then extract it, as we have said. 
Then soak cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with small cushions. 
And among people there are those who grind salt and place it in the cavity of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may dissolve. 
Then treat it until it heals. 
If however a hot abscess occurs in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ On the types of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft, whereupon it wrinkles in a way it shouldn't.
Chapter XI.
When additional hairs grow in the eyelids beneath the natural hairs and become established: then they harm the eye and cause various types of ailments, such as constant tearing, softening of the eyelids, and white spots, until this becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
And indeed Ataxmir of the eye is treated in four ways.
Either by cautery with fire.
Or with sharp medicine, according to what was described in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Or by tubes, according to what I will describe.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap.
Then turn the eyelid with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle with thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate through with the thread from above, and let this be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it with a probe.
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the additional hairs with a cutting spatula from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with ink a figure like a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the figure be according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: since this varies among people.
Among them indeed is one who needs to have cut from the eyelid a large amount, according to the amount that has become soft from the eyelid.
Then with the spatula cut along the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct up to the smaller tear duct, and let one cut be near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a probe.
Then insert a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Then excise all of it.
Then join the two edges with sutures, using a needle and fine wool thread: and wipe away the blood, and make what is excess of the threads adhere above the two eyebrows, with certain sticky substances, if you wish to do this: and if not, don't worry about it.
Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days: afterward treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with something that dries and constricts.
For the eyelid is elevated during the sealing of the wound and its joining: but suturing is better.
The ancients taught this method of treating Ataxmir.
However, in it there is concern for the patient, and it is from good practice, and there is no fear in it.
And there is another method also in Ataxmir: and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure that is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we described.
Then elevate the eyelid with three hooks separated or joined, according to this form which follows, then cut what is excess with small scissors, according to this form, with evenness of incision.
If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and that is not even: then take a needle with thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and gather the threads between your fingers evenly.
Then raise your hand with an even elevation: and elevate the skin over which the cotton is marked, as we described.
Then join the two edges of the wound with sutures: and treat it until it heals.
If however swelling occurs at your incision or your cut: calm that swelling with wax ointment, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it also happens to the eyelid that its hairs turn inward.
Therefore it is necessary that you use in it what we said in incision: but suturing in both cases is more skillful.
On the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds. 
And it is thus: you turn over the eyelid and make an incision in the inner fissure, according to what I have described. 
Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood: their length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already made cuts in the extremities of both on both sides where you hold the threads. 
Then carefully bring both together over what protrudes from the eyelid, and bind the two reeds tightly on both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. 
For the constricted skin will die, turn black, and rot, until it falls off by itself. 
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. 
Then treat it until it heals. 
When therefore it heals, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick. 
And this is the form of the two reeds, which you will make according to this figure and measurement in length and width. 
On raising pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII. 
The operation in this case is that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread. 
Then gather its ends, and tie both with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm. 
Then arrange in the Alinxotati another fine thread below it briefly, and tie its ends if you wish. 
Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation is clear: since it is a delicate or minute operation. 
Then insert the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair. 
Then draw the hair up above the alinxotati: and insert into the alinxotati that hair: whether it is one, or two, or three, not more. 
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair. 
But if the alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull the alinxotati downward, with the thread that you arranged in it, until the alinxotati comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with your eye: then indeed pull the alinxotati and the thread: and extract both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it. 
But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is raised with it: or leave it until it lengthens after a time, and then raise it. 
On the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII. 
When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina (Hare-eye). 
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental. 
The accidental therefore occurs from the healing of a wound, or an incision, or a cautery, and similar things to these. 
And the method of operation in it is that you split that healed area, and separate its edges, and place between them a lint of flax, and bind it until it heals. 
And it is not proper that you use in its treatment things which dry out and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather use in it things which soften, like fenugreek: and foment with water in which marsh-mallow and flaxseed have been cooked: and with diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some of the oils: and wrap the lint with it, and treat with it. 
And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all ingenuity, that it does not heal according to the form which was there at first. 
And this operation which we have described is nothing but a certain rectification of Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return entirely to what it was.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Chapter 14.
This Alxatrati which occurs below is what is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental type occurs from a wound, or a fissure, or cauterization, and similar things.
And the method of operation for it is that you should take a needle with a double thread, and push it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upward with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a probe, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them: until when they are joined their shape becomes this figure, which is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower edge, from what follows the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts: sew it with wool thread.
Then treat them with what we mentioned, with softening medicines, and lint, until they heal.
And if Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cauterization: then you should make a flat fissure under the eyelid hairs, also according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with lint, according to what we said.
And the summary of the discussion about treating Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed in it according to how the form of Alxatrati presents itself.
For it has many variations in form: and the skilled craftsman prepares his technique in whatever way is possible for him, until he makes the shape return to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him in terms of operation and instruments in most conditions.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter 15.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, such that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid, and raise it upward: or stretch it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not have a sharp cutting edge, rather it should be somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not harm the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you are skinning that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion heals.
Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with water: or drip into it from an eye-salve made from verdigris dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and eye with linen lint: and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white: and after the third day use eye-salve, and with healing agents, until it heals.
¶ On the incision of the pterygium and the prominent flesh of the tear ducts.
Chapter 16.
Know that the pterygium occurs in two forms.
Either it is fibrous: and it is similar to a hard, thin membrane.
Or it is non-fibrous, similar to white congealed fluid: which when iron touches it, or when you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks apart, and the hook does not hold in it.
And both types begin only from the larger tear duct, until it gradually progresses until it covers the vision, and blocks light, and movement of the eye.
And the method of operating in its incision is: that the patient places their head in your lap.
Then open their eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Then gather the pterygium with a hook of little doubling, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from a horse, and ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the pterygium: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the pterygium with the thread, and extend it upwards: and strip away with the hair the side of the pterygium that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair all the way to its end.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that constant tearing does not occur from its incision.
And sometimes the pterygium is extended with just a hook: or with thread, as we have said.
Then it is stripped away with a smooth spatula, whose form is this.
And be careful, lest the spatula touch the cornea, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is perforated.
Then after the incision, throw into the eye some ground salt, or from an eye-salve made from verdigris, and leave it until another day.
Then treat it with what is appropriate, until it heals.
But if the pterygium is non-fibrous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor does a hook hold in it, then many times this type of pterygium is treated with medicines, and heals as I described in the division.
But if you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take a fine spatula, smooth, of weak sharpness, according to this form.
And scrape the pterygium from above with a scraping motion with delicacy.
But if you see that it becomes thin and breaks apart, and the scraping makes an impression in it, then drip at that time into the eye from an eye-salve made from verdigris, or from red eye-salve, or ground salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation upon it, until all of it is removed.
Unless there is opposing you in the eye a hot abscess: then indeed leave it, and treat the abscess, until it heals.
Then repeat the operation upon it with scraping, until it heals.
The prominence of the tear duct flesh, however, if it causes great harm in the eye, let it be suspended with a hook, and cut from it a part of it: and do not complete the incision, so that constant tearing does not occur.
Then drip into the tear duct red eye-salve, or one made from verdigris, until it heals.
On the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh growth in the eye.
Chapter 17. 
Sometimes in certain human eyes there grows red flesh, either composite or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or binds over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a pomegranate flower. 
And the operation for this is also that the patient should place their head in your lap. 
Then open their eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for that purpose: and hold it with one forceps, or surgical instrument. 
Then first cut the flesh, until all of it is removed with the cutting instrument. 
And be careful with the eye, so that you do not harm it during the operation: and let your incision with which you cut it be either with the small spatula, which we described in the section on pterygium incision: or with small scissors, with which asebel is collected, according to the form that will come after this chapter. 
Therefore when your incision is complete, and all of the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or drip in red powder, and similar corrosive medicines: and place externally on the eye a cotton pad with egg white: so that it may be protected from hot inflammation. 
If any of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear hot inflammation: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms inflammation. 
Then return to it with the operation, until it is healed. 
And similarly do with additional flesh which occurs in the eye of this type. 
However, it is necessary that you avoid treating any eye that is weak by nature or by accident by operating with iron: and do not introduce your hand in any of these operations until you see that that member can tolerate that operation. 
On the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter 18. 
Sebel are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent vision its operation: and weaken the eye with the length of days. 
Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is Sebel is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides Sebel: then collect its Sebel. 
And it is that you should instruct the patient to place their head in your lap. 
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be of subtle doubling, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, according to this form. 
Then collect with subtle scissors those veins with subtlety, and wipe away blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are dissolved: and be careful not to harm the eye with the ends of the spatulas. 
And let your operation be at noon before the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you cut nothing except those veins. 
And when you have finished, then drip green or red sief into the eye: so that by its sharpness it may corrode what remained of the sebel. 
If however it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which sedates the pain of the eye: and leave it for some days, until its pain is sedated: and it is secured from hot inflammation: then return to it in the same way, until it is healed. 
And this is the form of the scissors.
On the Reduction of Arissati to the Nose.
Chapter 19.
Doctors call Arissati a Fistula, which you treat with cautery, or with sharp burning medicine, according to what was previously described.
And if it does not heal, then there is no technique for it except to cut open above the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption in it, or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is called "of the rough head."
Let it be made from Indian iron, and let its head be round like azir, which should be dotted with file-like dotting, or with aliskilfer dotting with fine points: and place it over the corrupted part of the bone.
Then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Then restore the area with drying astringent medicines.
If therefore the area heals, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus stops: and it remains for forty days, and does not renew, and does not form an abscess, and no complication occurs in it: then know that it has healed.
And if not, then there is no technique for it except to redirect the fistula to the nose opening, according to this form.
That is, expose it from the second bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill of this form, let the iron tip be triangular: and its wood should be a pyramid tapered to the tip, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and keep your hand a little distance from the eye.
Then rotate your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: by this that he finds wind coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the area with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh grows, and the area hardens: then the matter which was pouring to the outside returns to the nose: this is therefore easier for the patient.
On the Reduction of Eye Protrusion.
Chapter 20.
When the Eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm occurs to vision, nor diminishment: then it is necessary that you loosen the patient: then perform phlebotomy on him: afterwards place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the Eye a liniment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Then bind the Eye from above over the plaster with many compresses.
And the method of compresses is: that you take many soft cloths, and each cloth from them should be folded in four: make many of these: then place them one above another, according to the quantity that the Eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth with strong binding.
And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound for a day and night.
If however the bandage becomes loose again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly: then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has returned to the uveal tunic, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and compresses, and binding, and cupping glasses, until it heals.
On the Incision of the Uveal Membrane.
Chapter 21. 
When a rupture occurs in the uveal membrane, and then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is disfigured because of it, and you wish to cut it: then the operation on it is as I describe: that is, you should insert a needle at the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part. 
Then insert another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate: and leave the first needle in its position. 
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the needle: and tighten it firmly. 
Then remove the needle, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye: and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea. 
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound heals. 
And sometimes the uvea is constricted from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye produces a large protrusion. 
Then it should be perforated with a fine spatula, which should reach to the depth of the eye, and the albuminous fluid should flow, and the eye should descend, and enter immediately: then compress it until it heals. 
On the Treatment of Alcomnati.
Chapter 22. 
This Disease which is called Alcomnati is nothing but pus, which collects in the eye, similar to descending water, but is not the same. 
And the method of operating on it is that you should have the patient sit on a prepared or straight seat. 
Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower part with your eyes. 
Then it should be fixed, and not descend, and light should be released: and the patient should see things as he used to see: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water. 
If however the descent of pus is not achieved with what we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands. 
Then take a fine spatula, and make a small incision with it above the corneal membrane at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the corona, until the pus comes out. 
When therefore it comes out, then drip warm water mixed with honey into the eye: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then it should be treated with the remaining treatment until it heals.
On the treatment of water that descends in the eye, or cataract.
Chapter 23. 
We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing with explanatory and expository discourse, so take that same according to health. 
Therefore you should have the patient sit square between your hands, facing the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and bind it tightly: then [hold] his eyelid with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one. 
Then take the needle (almagda) in your right hand, if the eye is left: or in your left hand, if the eye is right. 
Then place the tip of the needle near the corona [iris] about the width of a radius in the white of the eye appearing at the smaller tear duct: then push the needle with force: and you rotate your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the needle has reached an empty space. 
And the measure of the needle's path to the depth should be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: which is the corona of the eye. 
For you will see these things in the pupil itself by visual inspection, due to the clarity of the corneal membrane. 
Then place the needle up to the place where the water is. 
Then press it downward one time after another. 
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the patient sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, with the needle still in his eye. 
Then rest for a little while. 
If therefore the water descends, then lower it a second time, before the needle comes out. 
When therefore it is fixed and does not rise: then extract the needle with care: and you rotate your hand gradually. 
Then dissolve some clear rock salt in water: and wash the inside of the eye with it. 
Then place outside the whole eye either tow or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white: and bind the healthy eye with it. 
We moreover, and those of our time, place ground cumin with egg white upon it. 
But if the needle does not yield to you for entry into the eye due to its hardness, since among men there are those whose eye is very hard: then you should take the small spatula which is called Alberid, of which this is the form. 
Therefore perforate the conjunctiva itself only with it, and do not complete your hand in the hole: and it is only so that you make a subtle path to the place for the needle. 
Then insert the needle, according to what we have said. 
And at the completion of your operation, let a properly made sleeping place be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and let him be prohibited from all movements and from coughing: and make his food that which softens his nature: and let him not move his head right or left at all. 
And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day. 
Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his vision: and make him look at things. 
Then replace the bandage until the seventh day. 
And he should not do that at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather you should keep that away: because the water rises quickly through intense looking. 
But if a hot swelling occurs: then you should loosen the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with that which calms the swelling, until it is calmed: then free his vision, and place over his face a veil by which his vision may be regulated under it for some days, while he remains in that dark room. 
Then let him leave the room gradually, and spend time in his houses. 
And know that in surgery the student cannot be excused from observing sometimes: for then he may dare to perform the operation. 
And indeed there has come to us someone from those who are from Alayrach, who said that in Alayrach a perforated needle (magdan) was made, by which water is sucked out. 
But truly I have not seen anyone in our land who has done that: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that this is new. 
And these are the forms of the types of needle, so that one who is ignorant of them may understand them. 
Let them be made specifically from brass: and let their ends be with this same subtlety triangulated, and the end sharp. 
Forms of the needle.
¶ On the Treatment of Flesh Growing in the Nose.
Chapter 24. 
Various types of additional flesh sometimes grow in the nose, among which is one that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and among them is cancerous flesh, stone-like, of dark color; and among them is flesh that is smooth, not of dark color. 
Therefore in the case of flesh among these that is smooth, not deceitful, nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit before you facing the sun, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into that flesh; then draw it outward, and cut what you have grasped of it with a thin sharp spatula from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed. 
If any should remain whose removal is not possible: then scrape it with one of the fine instruments gently, until nothing of it remains. 
If however blood overwhelms you, or a hot swelling occurs: then treat it as appropriate: or if it is among the malignant swellings, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is stopped, and all flesh is removed. 
Then after the incision, pour vinegar and water, or wine into the nose. 
If however the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it down to the palate, then know that it is already healed. 
If truly the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it there is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nostril, which the instrument cannot reach with cutting. 
Therefore then it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it: and place between each knot the distance of a finger, or less: and the patient should contrive to insert one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for them after making it similar to azer: and draw in their breath until it reaches the palate and comes out above their throat. 
And indeed many times the school boys do similar to this in schools: and it is an easy thing for one who wishes. 
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out above the nose, and the other which remained in the nose. 
Then administer the sawing of the flesh with the knots that are in the thread. 
Do this until you know that the flesh has been caught with the knots of the thread. 
Then extract the thread: and place in the nose after cleaning the blood a plug which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remained of the flesh. 
Then at the end of the matter place a lead tube in the nose, for several days, until it heals. 
If however it needs treatment that dries, use that. 
For making head-purging, with which oils and other medicines are dripped into the nose, make that from silver, or bronze: which should be similar to a small lamp, open like a small shell: and its passage likewise. 
And if you wish make a closed tube, like a reed. 
And the shell of the instrument for making head-purging should be full, uncovered: which should have a handle at its back, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you want from juices and flowing substances. 
And this is the form of the instrument. 
¶ On the Treatment of Thelul of the nose.
Chapter 25. 
Many times Thelul is born at the extremity of the nose, and grows large, and increases with days, until its appearance becomes foul. 
And because of that it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning of its appearance, and root out all of it. 
Then place over the spot either cautery, or burning medicine which serves in place of it. 
If therefore its cutting is delayed until it grows large, then consider, if it is stone-like, hard, of dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: since it is a cancerous swelling. 
For many times I have seen one who cut such a swelling, and great harm occurred from it to the one who had it. 
And if the swelling is soft to touch, not of dark color, and you see that cutting is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient, and cut it without fear, without dread: and treat the spot with that which dries and constricts, until it heals.
On the suture of the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter 26.
Know that when a break in continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, treatment is of little benefit, except in certain people.
Therefore when something of this sort happens to someone, you should consider whether it is a fresh wound with its blood: and then join the two lips of the wound with a suture: then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the break in continuity are already separated, and each part has become healthy: then you should scrape each part from its visible skin until it bleeds.
Then join the two lips with a suture, and bind them, and sprinkle over it dragon's blood and ground frankincense: and place above the powders a piece of diaphoenicon plaster, and some other consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then loosen it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads fall off by themselves.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is to join the break in continuity, either with needles, as we described in the suture of the belly: or join the break with thread, as I made known to you. 
On the extraction of nodes from the lips.
Chapter 27.
Indeed, many people often develop hard swellings similar to vetch seeds on the inside of their lips: and some of them smaller, and larger.
Therefore you should turn the lip, and cut into each of its nodes, and lift it with a hook, and cut it away from all sides.
Then fill the place after the incision with ground vitriol, until the bleeding stops.
Then let it be washed with vinegar, and let the area be treated with something astringent, until the wounds heal. 
On the cutting of flesh grown over the gum.
Chapter 28.
Often flesh grows over the gum additionally, which the ancients called abuluss.
Therefore you should lift it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Then place ground vitriol on the spot, or other astringent, drying powders.
But if that flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization. 
On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Chapter 29.
Sometimes rough, unsightly crusts gather on the surfaces of teeth from the inside and outside, and between the gums, and sometimes they become black, and yellow, and green, until corruption reaches the gum from this, and the teeth become foul because of it.
Therefore you should have the patient sit before you, and their head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth in which crusts and things similar to sand appear to you: until nothing of them remains, and similarly do this with blackness, and greenness, and yellowness, and others until they are cleaned.
If therefore what is in them is removed from the beginning of scraping, it is good: and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second, and third time, until finally you achieve what you want.
And know that the tooth needs scrapers of different forms, of many shapes: according to what is prepared for your operation: because the scraper which scrapes the tooth from below is different from the scraper which scrapes between teeth, according to other forms.
And these forms of scrapers should be prepared with you, which you see.
¶ On extracting tooth pain.
Chapter 30.
It is necessary that you treat the tooth and its pain with all skill, and delay its extraction.
For there is nothing that can replace it when it is extracted: since it is an elevated substance: until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary when the patient is forced to extract it, that the painful tooth be confirmed and verified by you.
For many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a healthy tooth and extracts it: then the pain does not go away, until the diseased tooth is extracted.
We have indeed seen this from the work of bloodletters.
When therefore the painful tooth itself is verified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a small spatula, in which there should be some force, until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it loose.
Then place large forceps on it with good positioning, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have already held firmly, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from all sides with care, and attempt to move it, as you did at first.
If however the tooth is perforated, or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and tighten it with the end of a fine probe, so that it does not break at the moment of your gripping it with the forceps.
And it is necessary, that you act precisely with scarification around the gum from all sides extensively.
And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and part of it remains, and return to the patient from it an evil which would be greater than his first pain.
And beware, lest you do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste, and their boldness in extracting it, without administering what we have described.
For many times they cause great illnesses to happen to people, the more difficult of which are that they break, and all or some of their roots remain: or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have witnessed many times.
Then after its extraction it should be washed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
If bleeding occurs from the sites (for it often occurs) then grind some vitriol, and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the vitriol does not help you.
The forms of fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved, should be of long tips, short handle, thick, so that they do not bend when pressed upon the tooth with them: they should be as you see of thick handles, so that when you grip with them, they do not give way, nor bend: of short tips, and they should be made of Indian iron, or of steel properly made, with straight tips: and in their tips there should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with proper, strong constraint.
And sometimes the tips are made like the form of the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, and they are of strong grip.
¶ On the Extraction of Teeth and Removal of Broken Jaw Bones.
Chapter 31.
When something remains broken during the extraction of a tooth, then it is necessary to place cotton with butter on the spot for one or two days, until the area softens: then insert the forceps, or pliers whose tips resemble the beak of a bird called the stork.
This is the form of the forceps.
Let their tips be made like a file on the inside: or like the aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you hollow out above the root, and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short at the tip, somewhat thick: and not be absorbed, so that it does not break.
If therefore the root comes out by that means, it is good: and if not, one must assist with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Form of the first with triangular tip, in which there is some thickness.
Form of the thin triangular tip.
Also one is aided by this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
And with other instruments and iron tools which preceded in the scraping of teeth.
Also there is help with this instrument which resembles a large hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular tip, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break: and let it not be absorbed.
And know that dental instruments are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the prudent craftsman, skilled in his art, finds by himself an instrument, according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves indicate to him.
For among illnesses there are those for which the ancients did not prescribe an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
If however a bone from the jaw breaks, or from other bones of the mouth, or decays: then examine it in its place with what is suitable for it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and assist with the gesti, whose form is this.
Let there be in it some thickness gradually, so that the bone may be gripped, or held with it, and not escape and go away, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable for that.
If however there is small decay in the bone, then scrape it from its decay, and treat it until it heals.
On the Filing of Teeth Protruding Above Others.
Chapter 32.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, the form becomes ugly: and especially when this happens in women, and girls, namely those for sale.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not located, or its filing is possible, nor its smoothing: then extract it: and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made from Indian iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your cutting with which you cut it be over many days, both because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
If however it is protruding exposed to its filing: then file it with a file made of Indian [iron], whose form is this.
Let it all be from Indian [iron], and its handle very finely pointed, like the file with which needles are made: with which the tooth should be filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls: then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
But if it is a tooth, from which a part breaks, and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary that you also file it, until the roughness of that break is removed, and it is made even: and smoothed, and does not hurt the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ On Binding Teeth with Gold Wires
Chapter 33 
When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite firmly on what they eat without it falling, and you have treated them with astringent medicines without success, then the clever solution for them is to bind them with gold wire, since silver turns green and deteriorates after some days, but gold never changes. 
And let the wire be medium in thinness and thickness according to the space it must fit between the teeth. 
And indeed the form of binding is thus: take a wire and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then weave with the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you arrive with the weaving up to a healthy tooth on the other side. 
Then repeat the weaving back to the side where you began, and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it does not move at all; and let your tightening with which you secure the wire be at the roots of the teeth, so it doesn't slip away. 
Then cut off the excess wire ends with scissors, and bring both together, and turn them with a tool, and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so they don't harm the tongue; then leave it bound thus while it remains. 
If however it loosens or breaks, bind them with another wire, and it will stay thus for the entire time. 
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the binding of two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see. 
And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two return after the fall of either in their places, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and none does this except a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman. 
And sometimes something from cow bones is fitted, and is made into the form of a tooth, and is placed in the spot from which the tooth was removed and is bound, as we said; and it remains, and serves for a long time. 
¶ On Cutting the Ligament that Occurs Under the Tongue and Prevents Speech
Chapter 34 
Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed. 
And the operation on it is thus: open the patient's mouth with their head in your lap, and raise their tongue; then cut that sinewy ligament across its width until the tongue is freed from its restraint. 
But if there is any hardness and knotting in it, and this is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and split it across its width until you cut the ligament and the knot is loosened. 
And beware lest the cut be too deep in the flesh, and you cut an artery there, and bleeding occurs. 
Then immediately wash the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or cold water. 
Then place under the tongue a linen plug, which the patient should keep there every night, so it doesn't heal a second time. 
If however bleeding occurs, then place ground vitriol on the spot. 
But if the blood overwhelms you, then cauterize the spot with a lentil-shaped cautery, which is suitable for this; then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals. 
¶ On Removing the Ranula that Forms Under the Tongue
Chapter 35 
Sometimes an swelling occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural operation; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth. 
And the operation on it is thus: open the patient's mouth facing the sun, and examine the swelling. 
If therefore you see it is of a dark or black color, hard, which the patient cannot feel, then do not touch it, for it is cancer. 
And if it tends toward whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it and cut it with a fine spatula, and free it from all sides. 
But if blood overwhelms you during your operation, then place ground vitriol on it until the blood is stopped; then return to your operation until you extract it completely. 
Then let it be washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with the remaining suitable treatment until it heals.
On the treatment of apostemes (abscesses) of the two Tonsils.
Chapter 36. 
Sometimes there occur between the throat godad, that is, glands, which resemble the algodad that occur externally: and they are called the two Tonsils: when you treat them with what we have described in the division, and they do not heal, then consider. 
If therefore the aposteme is hard, of dark color, with little sensitivity: then do not touch it with iron. 
And if it is of red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it also with iron, fearing blood flow, but rather leave it until it matures. 
And then either you will pierce it: or it will break by itself. 
And if it is of white color, round, and its root is thin: then it needs to be cut. 
And the operation on it is that you should consider before its operation, if its hot aposteme has completely quieted, or has diminished somewhat: then therefore have the patient sit facing the sun, and his head should be in your lap: and open his mouth, and let a servant take between his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, whose form is this. 
Let it be made from silver, or bronze, which should be thin like a small knife. 
When therefore you press the tongue with it, and the aposteme is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, without pulling with it anything from the membranes. 
Then cut it with an instrument, whose form is as follows. 
It resembles scissors: however its ends should be curved, so that the orifice of each of them is directly opposite the other sharply: hence ensure that it is made from Indian iron, or soaked alfuled. 
If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this. 
Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side. 
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision. 
Then after the incision let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water. 
But if bleeding occurs, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate peels have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar astringent things, until the blood flow is stopped: then treat him until he is healed. 
And sometimes other apostemes grow in the throat, besides the two tonsils. 
Cut them therefore according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally. 
And I indeed once treated a woman for an aposteme, which had grown between her throat, which tended toward darkness, with little sensitivity, which had already nearly closed the throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating, and drinking water: and she would have reached death, if she had remained one day, or two days. 
And the aposteme had ascended so much, that it had sent out two branches, until they came out above the two nostrils. 
I hurried therefore hastily, and fixed a hook in one of them. 
Then I drew it, and a large portion was drawn from it. 
Then I cut it off, where I had grasped it from the nostril. 
Then I did the same to what had proceeded from the other nostril. 
Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: and afterward fixed the hook in the aposteme itself: then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood ran from it: therefore the woman's throat was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food. 
Therefore I did not cease to cut from that aposteme many times over a long time: and the aposteme would succeed in the place of what I had cut, until it was prolonged excessively with her. 
Therefore I devised, and cauterized the aposteme between the throat. 
Therefore it stopped from increasing: then I went away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
On the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Chapter 37.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes swollen, and is long: then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in its lower part, then it is called grape-shaped.
When it is treated with what we described in the section, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the hot swelling has subsided from it, and it is thin: then it is necessary to cut it.
And that which of it is collected round, and has no length, and is bloody, or of dark color, or black, and has no feeling: then you must avoid cutting it.
For in it there is danger to the patient.
Therefore when you see it according to the manner I described with whiteness and length, you should have the patient sit facing the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument, whose description preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula, and pull it downward: and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And you should not cut from it except that which extends beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the incision use what we described in the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it heals.
But if the patient is frightened of the incision: then you must use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
And the method of cautery in it is only with sharp water: and it is that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Then take from the water which I described to you in the chapter on cauterizing, and mix with it unslaked lime, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the cavity of this instrument, whose form is this.
Let its extremity in which the medicine is placed have a cavity like the cavity of a probe's spoon.
And place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself: and let the patient lie on his side, so that saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that none of it descends to his throat and harms him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And press it on the uvula for half an hour, until you see it has become black, and the stinging of the medicine has subsided.
And if you wish to take cotton, and wrap it around the end of the probe, and soak the cotton with the medicine, and insert the probe with the cotton in the tube from above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula.
Do that many times, until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula.
Then leave it: for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and clean what is around it from the medicine: and let it be rinsed with cold water.
And let it be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
This type of treatment is therefore safer than incision and further from danger.
And sometimes the uvula is also treated with what is more subtle than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Take calamint, and hyssop, and oregano, and rue, and sseah, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and let them boil: and let the pot be properly sealed with clay: and let there be in the middle of the pot a hole, over which a hollow instrument is placed according to this method.
Let it be made from silver or brass: and let the extremity, in which there is a pomegranate, be inserted into the patient's mouth, until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula becomes quite dark.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries up.
And beware, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling: and you should not do it except during the decline of its hot swelling.
If however this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed, and attach an eggshell at its end: so that the patient's mouth is not burned: since the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is among the good treatments with safety.
¶ On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often a bone, or fish bone, or something else gets stuck in the throat.
Therefore you should extract what is visible of these upon which sight falls, after you press down the tongue with an instrument in sunlight, and what is in the throat becomes clear to you.
And what is not visible to you and is hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip, or lettuce root, or swallow a morsel of dry bread: or take a piece of soft dried sea sponge: and tie it with a thread, then let him swallow it.
When therefore it reaches the place where the thorns or bone are, and is withdrawn, then it comes out.
If therefore it does not come out with what we have mentioned: then use a lead instrument according to this form.
Let it be somewhat thicker than a probe, and at its end let there be a curve, which he should insert into his throat with ease: and he should have his head raised upward.
And he should beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing occur, and push the bone or thorn with it, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
Indeed it is better that the patient insert it: because of his knowledge of the location of the attached thing: and push downward, or pull his hand with the instrument upward, all that according to the amount that is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ On the extraction of Leeches.
Chapter 39.
When a leech is treated with what I mentioned in the division about treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then examine the patient's throat in front of the sun, or by the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument I described to you.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps appropriately.
But if it is not possible with these: then take a hollow reed, and insert it into the patient's throat up to near the throat: then insert into the hollow of the reed an iron heated with fire.
Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water all day.
Then let him take a glass full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow any of it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately falls when it senses water.
If however it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs, or with asafoetida using the instrument I described for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this many times, for it will fall.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot, in which there are live coals with fire: and let the pot be covered with a lid, in whose middle there is a hole: and let the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Then cast the fumigation, and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the reed, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall.
But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
It is therefore necessary that it come out with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when sight falls upon it.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
And its end is similar to the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
On the opening of Abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many types of abscesses, of many kinds, according to what has been mentioned about them, namely one by one in this book: and they differ in their perforation and incision in two ways.
One of these is from the type of abscess itself, and what it contains of fluids.
And the second way is because of the places in the body where it occurs.
For an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment regarding treatment.
And among abscesses there are those which should not be opened except after the maturation of pus in them and its completion: and among them are those which should be opened while they are raw and not fully matured.
Like abscesses that are near to joints.
For when an abscess occurs near a joint and its existence is prolonged until what is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: which is a more immediate cause of contraction of that limb.
Or it is an abscess near a principal member: for if you delay its opening until it matures, it will harm either it or through it the principal member.
Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it while immature: and you should not pierce a raw abscess of incomplete digestion, except what is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or reach a point where it cannot be healed.
You should know the time for opening an abscess that is fully matured: and it is upon the settling of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness and pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and other signs.
And you should make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and at its most prominent point: and let the perforation go in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in parts of the hands and feet, and in places of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and finally in all even places which have no bend.
In those that do bend, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
When the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to postpone its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we said, to completion.
For if you pierce it before that, the flow of virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and dirt, and perhaps its lips and its depth become hardened.
And certain abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body when necessary: or according to what the member needs.
And you should administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a wide perforation: or many incisions according to the similarity of the size of the abscess.
And there are among abscesses those in which it is necessary to hollow out the skin: and cut it when it has already become like cloth, and has reached the point where it is already dead: like that which occurs in many, such as dubelet and buboes.
And among them are those which are cut with a triangular incision.
And among them is that from which is cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like the abscess of the groin.
And among them are those in which a round incision and a lunar incision are administered: and similar ones from incisions.
That which has no head, like superficial smooth abscesses, you should pierce it with a superficial or flat perforation only.
And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not hurry and extract all the pus at that time: rather extract a portion of it.
Then plug the abscess until another day.
Then extract some more pus again.
Do this many times gradually until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old man: for the vital spirit often leaves the body with the release of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore be very careful with this chapter.
And after your perforation, with which you pierce these abscesses, you should clean the wound: and observe.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is flat, then apply lint made from linen or old cotton.
And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures from the perforation, then it is necessary to insert lint into every fissure, until they meet each other.
And if in the abscess you have cut away part of the skin, or hollowed it out around the circumference: then you should fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is woven, or with scraped flax fiber without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with whatever ointment is necessary, until it heals.
If however bleeding occurs at the time of your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them: and place it over the site of bleeding many times.
If however the bleeding persists, then you should administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and from the division.
If however it is in winter time, and the site of the abscess has many nerves: then you should soak the compresses with warm wine and oil: and place them over the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then you should place compresses soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then you should loosen the abscess, and clean it, and administer in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it heals.
This therefore is what is necessary to know about the treatment of abscesses in general.
According to the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment chapter by chapter individually.
On the incision of abscesses that occur in the skin of the head.
Chapter 41.
Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the types of Nodes, which are contained by tunics that are like sacs to them: as if they were like the crop of a chicken.
And their types are many.
Among them are fatty ones: and among them are those that contain moisture similar to mud: and among them are those that contain moisture similar to ground grain and porridge: and similar things, and among them are those that are stone-hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction there is no fear, as long as during their incision no artery presents opposition.
And the procedure in cutting them is that you examine them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called the Probe, until you know what it contains.
For if it is that which contains fluid, then cut it with an incision along the length with a superficial cut: according to this form.
And begin with the incision from line b. to line g. Then when the fluid is evacuated, strip away the cyst which contains that fluid, and do not leave any of it at all.
For many times it returns, if anything of it remains.
Then submerge cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remained of the cyst.
Then repeat the cotton with Egyptian [ointment] a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess contains a fatty node: then cut it according to this form, with an incision having the form of a cross: and insert hooks between the two lips of the incision, and strip it away from all sides: and concentrate your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
But if an artery presents opposition to you, then do what I will tell you later.
And similarly do in the case of an abscess, if it is stony, with the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
And the incision upon a stony abscess is easier: since it has little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses which are in the head in some people, with which there is absolutely no moisture.
That is: because I cut into an abscess in the head of an old woman, and found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone were struck by throwing it, it would wound them.
In other abscesses occurring in the head, besides these namely abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Or place their perforation always at their lower part, so that the flow of pus is eased downward.
Then treat them with what is suitable for them in terms of treatment.
On the Excision of Scrofulas in the Neck.
Chapter 42.
These swellings often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And those of them that occur in the neck are single or multiple: and they generate from one another: and every Scrofula among them is within its own membrane, as is the case with nodes and swellings of the head, as we have described.
And the types of these Scrofulas are many.
And among them indeed some are stone-like: and some of them contain fluids: and some of them are malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
Therefore, for the one among them that you see to be of good condition to the touch, whose appearance is close to skin color, and moves in all directions, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the jugular, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you should cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b. to line g. and separate it from all sides: and stretch the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said regarding swellings of the head, and extract it gradually.
And one must be cautious not to cut a vein or nerve.
And let the spatula not be too sharp: so that it does not slip in your hand during cutting, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
If however you cut a vein, or artery, or it prevents you from operating, then place ground vitriol in the wound, or certain powders which stop blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the swelling subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to putrefy.
For the blood is stopped at once. Therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Then investigate with your index finger if any other small Scrofulas remain: therefore cut them out and clean them.
But if there is a large vein at the root of the Scrofula: then you should not cut that Scrofula from its root: rather you should tie it with a strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you have already immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Then treat it.
If the whole Scrofula is cut out, then you should bring together the two lips of the wound: and suture it immediately, after you see that absolutely no excess remains.
If however you see that excess remains due to the size of the Scrofula, then you should aim to cut its root, and extract it: and apply the suture which we mentioned.
And for those Scrofulas which contain fluids, pierce it with a superficial perforation: so that its point of maturation appears to you: and make the perforation from that which follows below the body, as we said.
Then after perforation, apply dressings with ointment, and similar things, to remove what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound is now clean: then treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
¶ On the incision of the Epiglottis from an abscess occurring inside the throat.
Chapter 43.
The ancients spoke of this incision in the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it: and this is the writing of their discourse.
In those having quinsy, the cutting of the Epiglottis should be avoided: since no benefit comes from it: because all the veins and the lung are weak.
But in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no disease in the airway, it is necessary to use incision of the Epiglottis, to escape from the destruction that comes from suffocation.
Therefore when we wish to do this, we should cut the Epiglottis below three rings of the Epiglottis, or four, with a small incision across the width, in that which is between two rings by such an amount, that the cut is in the membrane, not in the cartilage: and this indeed is the suitable place for cutting, since it is devoid of flesh, and blood vessels are far from it.
But if the physician is timid, then he should stretch the throat skin with a hook.
Then split the skin, until when he reaches the airway: avoid blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Then cut the membrane which we described: and the cutting of the airway is indicated by phlegm which comes out of it, with that which bursts forth, and loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
When therefore the time passes in which suffocation is feared, bring together the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then apply medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it heals.
Albucasis says:
The sum of this discourse which we have related, the explanation is only when they see that one of these abscesses has already blocked the throat of the sick person: and the sick person has been raised above death, and his breath wants to be cut off: they proceed to cut the Epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe through the wound site with some breathing, and be saved from death: and because of this they instructed to leave the wound open, until the malignancy of the disease is consumed, and its malignancy is three days, and almost the same: then therefore they instructed to sew the wound, and treat it until it heals.
And that which I saw myself is that a maid took a knife, and put it in her throat, and cut with it part of the lung's airway.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning, like the moaning of the dying.
I thus uncovered the wound, and found the blood which had come out from the wound was little.
I was thus confident that she had not cut a vein, nor the jugular: and wind was coming out of the wound.
I hurried therefore, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maid, except hoarseness in her voice: and after days she returned to her better conditions.
Hence therefore I say: that in cutting the Epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ On cutting the Hernia of the throat.
Chapter 44.
This Abscess named Hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is common in women.
And it is of two types: for either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In the natural certainly there is no remedy.
But the accidental is of two types: of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
And the other type is similar to an abscess which occurs from knotting of the artery.
And in it there is danger, and one should not make an attempt at it with iron, except in that which is small: and you test it, and investigate it with a probe.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not suspended with any of the veins: then cut it, as nodes are cut: and extract it with that which contains the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then search out all of it.
Then treat the area with what is necessary from treatment, until it heals.
¶ On the surgical treatment of various types of Nodes
Chapter 45.
There are many types of Nodes, and I have already described all their types in the classification: and here I must explain the difference between a Node and an Abscess, since it can cause confusion.
Therefore I say that with an Abscess there is heat, and fever, and severe pains, until the boiling of the superfluity subsides, and putrefaction is complete: for then the fever and heat cease.
With a Node however there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and they are contained within a membranous cyst, which is their proper sac, and it is the same color as the body: and they begin the size of a chickpea, and become like a melon, and larger and smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty, or containing fluid.
And the colors of the fluid are many, according to what I said in the classification.
Therefore, when you come to treat a Node, you must examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called the Probe, according to the form that will be shown in the chapter after this.
And the method of investigating swellings and all Nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most fluid place that you find in the swelling: and you rotate your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Then advance your hand according to the size of the swelling.
Then withdraw the Probe and examine what comes out in its track.
If therefore fluid comes out, whatever color it may be: then cut it with a superficial incision, according to what I said regarding other swellings.
And if no fluid comes out in the track of the Probe, then know that it is fatty: therefore cut over it with a cruciform incision, according to this form, as I taught you: and hold it with hooks, and carefully separate the skin from all sides: and preserve the cyst if you can, so that you may extract it intact with the Node.
But if the cyst ruptures during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it intact, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece until none of it remains.
For if any of it remains, whether little or much, the Node usually returns.
But if it defeats you, and a little remains: then fill the wound upon your completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place upon it what calms a hot swelling, and treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
If therefore the Node is large, then suture its two edges, and treat it with what causes flesh to grow.
But if you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vein: then hurry and fill the place with ground vitriol, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the blood's boiling subsides: then return to cutting what remained of the Node.
¶ On the forms of instruments for cutting and perforation.
Chapter 46.
Among these are the forms of probes, and they are of three types.
Of these, one is large, one is medium, and one is small.
They are made of iron with squared ends appropriately, so that they may quickly enter into abscesses.
And these are the forms of probes, and of perforating instruments: and one of them is called beris, that is, perforator: and they are of three types.
Of these indeed is large, medium, and small.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, lesions, fistulas, and swellings from what lies between them in the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, polished, like large needles with which cushions are sewn, made from brass, or from bronze, or iron, or silver.
And the best of them are those made from brass.
And probes are also made from black lead, which are suitable for examining fistulas that have bends in their cavity, so that they may bend with their smoothness along those curves.
And again they are of three types.
For among them are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
The form of hooks, and they are of many types.
For among them are simple ones, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three types as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And among them are blind hooks: and they are of three types.
And among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types: and among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three types: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and excoriated: and they are of three types: for among them is large, medium, and small.
Their ends with which cutting is done are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not made thus, except that with them help may be given in the excoriation of nodes when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that through them the patient may be healed, and find some relief from the burning which occurs during the excoriation of an abscess.
These are probes (Magda), and they are of three types.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to the stick with which kohl is applied: and in the broad end there is a hidden spatula point: and in it runs to the interior and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
The form of spatulas which are hidden between the fingers when perforating abscesses: and patients do not perceive them: and they are of three types, large, medium, and small.
The forms of cupping vessels with which blood flow is stopped: and they are of three types, large, medium, and small.
They are made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat elongated, as you see: and they should be rather thin.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping vessels be available to you, large and small: so that you may stop blood flow quickly when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
However, do not use them for stopping blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the muscles of the leg, and thigh, and muscles of the arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar to these, from among the fleshy, moist muscles.
And sometimes small instruments are made from these similar to pistachio shells, according to their form: with which blood is stopped when it flows from the place of bloodletting, or during the cutting of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
On the treatment of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Chapter 47.
Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to have nocturnal emissions) until they resemble women's breasts: and they remain swollen in an unsightly way.
Therefore, whoever abhors this condition should cut above the breasts with a lunar incision, according to this form from line b. to line g. Then strip away all the fat.
Afterward, fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
If however the breast droops downward and becomes soft due to its size, as happens in women: then it is necessary to make two incisions on its upper sides similar to the lunar figure, each of which connects with the other at both ends, so that the larger line contains the smaller one, according to this form from line b. to line g. Afterward strip away the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we mentioned about sutures and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
If however you cannot complete the incision of what you need to cut, due to the patient's restlessness, or due to blood flow: then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then treat it until it heals.
On the perforation of swellings that occur under the armpit.
Chapter 48.
These swellings that occur under the armpit are of the types of hard scrofula which contain cysts, and some of them contain fluids.
Therefore those of them which contain fluids should be cut with a lunar incision, according to this form, from line b. to line g. When therefore all the pus that is in the swelling is evacuated, then fill it with old cotton, and leave it until another day.
Then remove the cotton, and treat it with suitable ointment until it heals.
But if the swelling is of the type of scrofulous nodes, then cut into it, just as we described in the section on scrofula similarly.
If however the wound extends to emit pus, then apply cautery to it, according to what we described previously.
On cutting swellings that occur due to arteries and veins.
Chapter 49.
When an artery ruptures, and the skin above it heals over, then often a swelling occurs from this: and similarly it happens with veins also, that swelling and inflammation occur in them.
And the signs by which it is known that the swelling and inflammation are due to an artery and vein are: that when the swelling is due to an artery, it is long, gathered in the depth of the body: and when you push the swelling with your fingers, you feel as if it has a whistling sound.
And that which is due to a vein is round and visible on the body's surface.
And cutting into this type of swelling is an error, especially that which is under the armpits, and groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very dangerous.
Therefore its treatment with iron [surgical instruments] should be avoided, and those of them which are in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Therefore for that which is from inflation of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin lengthwise.
Then open the incision with hooks, then the artery: and free it from its coverings, until it is exposed.
Then introduce a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the swelling is resolved.
Then administer treatment which generates pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterward treat it with ointments suitable for that, until it heals.
If there is an abscess due to cutting a vein, then you should hold with your hand as much of the abscess with the skin as you can.
Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Then bind the abscess with this thread with a good binding: according to what I told you about binding a grape, from two parts with the two ends of the thread.
If however you fear that the thread might come out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess near the first needle's incision: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is inside comes out: then cut away the excess skin, and leave what is bound from it.
Then place upon it a compress which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer treatment, which is done with lint and ointments, until it heals.
¶ Concerning the abscess which occurs from twisting of Nerves.
Chapter 50.
Just as an abscess occurs in Artery and Vein, similarly an abscess occurs in Nerves: which occurs in them from a blow, or occurs from excessive work, and similar things: and it happens most often in those places of the upper arms, or heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Its color resembles the rest of the body, and is in most conditions without pain: and when it is pressed firmly, the patient feels something like numbness in it.
And it is not an abscess gathered in the depth of the body, but rather is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward, or ahead, nor backward to the rear.
Therefore those of them that are in joints, should not be invaded with iron.
For perhaps contraction will occur.
But in that which is of them in the head, or in the forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
If therefore the abscess is small, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it: then remove it, and join the wound with suture: and treat it until it heals.
¶ Concerning the cutting of an abscess, which occurs in the belly.
Chapter 51.
There occur in some people many times in their bellies, and in other parts of their bodies, warts, which are called Fungal, due to their similarity with mushrooms.
Whose root is thin, and their head is thick, and their edges are turned outward.
And some of them are small: and some of them become very large.
And I indeed have seen a man, and in his belly there were two warts, which were more similar to mushrooms than other things: there was no difference between them, white, of minute root, and their edges were turned outward, and they were split, and moisture always ran from them.
Therefore I cut them, and found in the weight of one about 18 ounces and in the other about 6 ounces And the operation in cutting them is, that you consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the wart is white, moist, of thin root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and let there be cauteries in the fire in your presence.
For many times during its cutting much blood is expelled: hurry therefore if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
But if you see the patient fearful and afraid of cutting with iron, then take a thread of lead properly made, and bind the wart with it: whose method is what we have said, and leave it for two days.
Then increase in the tightness of the lead.
Therefore do not cease to tighten the lead, as often as it makes an impression in the wart, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without effort.
If however the wart should be of thick root, then in cutting it there is something of fear and dread: especially that which is in the belly.
Nevertheless it is possible, that you cut half of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it, until the wound heals.
And beware lest you presume to cut a wart which is of dark color, of little sensation, of foul appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess: and I will come with the remembrance of Cancer after this.
On the Treatment of Protruding Navel.
Chapter 52.
A protruding navel occurs from many causes.
Either from tears in the sifac [abdominal wall] which is above the belly: and from it emerges the althub [omentum], or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood that flows from a Vein, or from an Artery, according to what was mentioned before.
Or from trapped wind in it.
If however it is due to a tear in the sifac, and exit of the omentum: then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body: and it is smooth, without pain: and appears in different positions.
And if it is due to the protrusion of intestine, then its position, with what we have described, is of greater variability.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears: then returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it greatly increases upon entering the bath, and with vigorous exercise.
If indeed it is due to fluid, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it increase.
But if it is due to blood, then with these signs the swelling appears declining toward blackness.
If however it is due to grown flesh: then the swelling is heavy, thick, hard, and fixed in one size.
If indeed it is due to wind, then its touch is smooth.
And the procedure in that case is, that you should consider then, if the protrusion of the navel is due to blood from an Artery, or Vein, or wind: then you must refrain from treating it.
For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of swellings due to artery and vein.
But if the protrusion of the navel is due to intestine, or omentum: then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and stand upright extended.
Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Afterward command them to lie back between your hands upon their back.
Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel above the place which you marked with ink.
Afterward extend the middle of the swelling upward, with a large hook.
Then bind it around firmly with thread, or with silk cord in a secure binding: and let the knot of the binding be of the alenxotati type [special surgical knot].
Then open the middle of the swelling extended above the binding.
If therefore you find it has been caught by the binding: then remove the alenxotati, and insert your index finger, and push the intestine to the interior of the belly: and if you find omentum, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
If however an artery or vein opposes you: then encircle it extensively.
Then return to your procedure.
And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads: and insert the two needles around what you made around the swelling in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then tighten the swelling in four places above the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefied.
Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments, until it heals.
But if the protrusion of the navel is from flesh grown in it, or from fluid: then you must hollow out the swelling, as we said.
And extract the blood, or fluid, which you find in it.
Then treat it with what solidifies the area.
On the treatment of CANCER.
Chapter 53.
We have already discussed in the classification the types of Cancer, and how it may be treated with medicines: and that treatment with iron [surgery] should be avoided, lest it become ulcerated: and we discussed Cancer generated in the womb, and the precaution in treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: like Cancer that is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar ones, from members situated for extracting all of it: especially when it is small and beginning.
When it is old and large, you should not approach it.
For I have not been able to cure any of it: nor have I seen another before me who achieved that.
And the operation on it, when it is situated as we said, is that you should proceed first and purge the patient of black bile several times.
Then bleed them if you find obvious fullness [of blood].
Then prepare the patient with preparation, in which they are positioned for the operation.
Then cast suitable hooks into the Cancer.
Afterwards hollow it out from all sides with the skin, according to careful examination, until none of its roots remain: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it off quickly, rather compress the areas, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
If however the flow of thick blood from cutting an artery or vein gives you trouble: then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
On the treatment of DROPSY.
Chapter 54.
We have already described in the classification the types of Dropsy, and how water accumulates: and the signs of every type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only the ascitic type alone: and the tympanitic type should not be approached with iron: nor the hyposarca type at all: for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this tympanitic type of Dropsy with medicines, and your treatment has not helped: then consider.
For if weakness has already followed in the patient, or there is another illness besides Dropsy: such as if they have a cough, or looseness of the belly, and similar things: then beware of treating them with iron: since that is dangerous.
But if you see the patient has abundant strength, and they have no illness besides Dropsy alone: and is neither a child nor elderly: then the method of operation on them is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and an assistant behind them compresses their belly with their hand pushing the water to the lower part of the pubic area.
Then take a spiny spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with a sharp end like a Spatula.
However let there be some gradual shortness in it, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation all the way to the intestine, and harm it.
Then consider.
For if the generation of Dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then you should distance yourself with the incision from the navel by the amount of three fingers, downward in line with it above the pubic area.
If however the generation of Dropsy is due to illness of the liver: then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and also the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wants to lie, so that excess fluids do not run to that weak place.
Then pierce through the whole skin with the instrument.
Then introduce into that incision, and raise your hand with the Spatula between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are skinning it: and let the amount that is skinned be the amount of a fingernail, or thereabouts.
Then pierce the peritoneum, until the Spatula reaches the empty space: which is the place of the water.
Then remove it, and introduce into the hole an instrument, of which this is the form.
And it is like a small tube: made from silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: which has a small hole in its lower part, and in its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and its end is cut, in the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate half the quantity of water at that time.
Since if you evacuate more of it than necessary, at that moment the patient may die through the dissolution of his vital spirit: or he may suffer a fainting spell that approaches death.
Indeed, evacuate from it according to the measure of his strength, and according to what the patient's conditions indicate to you from his pulse strength, and from its quality.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Which is because it is retained immediately due to the skin that holds the opening which is above the peritoneum: about which I told you to pierce it according to that method.
Then repeat the instrument the next day, if you see the patient can tolerate it: and draw out also a small quantity of water.
Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until nothing remains of the water except a little.
But if you are worried about the patient, and you leave much water: then treat him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in the bath and sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after extracting the water: according to what I described in what preceded.
¶ Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Chapter 55.
When any of the infants emerges from his mother's womb, and the head of his penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or not in its proper place.
Therefore it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when he is born with a very fine probe, according to this form.
Then place in the opening a thin nail of lead, and bind it: and keep it there for three or four days.
Therefore when he wants to urinate, let it be removed, and let him urinate.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is indeed possible that the urine which flows over the area will not allow it to close.
He whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is widened.
Those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are harmed.
Which is because among those who are born, the opening is at the end of the head of the penis: wherefore he cannot urinate forward, until he lifts the penis with his hand upward.
Nor does he have procreation, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul illness.
And the method of operation in that case is that the patient should lie back upon his back.
Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with strong extension, and cut the tip of the head of the penis from the place of the priapus, with a sharp point, or sharp probe: like the cutting of a reed, or as you scrape something, so that its middle comes to resemble the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
And guard yourself during your operation from the flow of blood.
For this often happens.
Therefore oppose it with that which stops blood, and treat the wound until it heals.
¶ On Albather (warts) which occur on the foreskin and head of the penis, and on corruption, blackening, and adhesion.
Chapter 56.
These Albather often occur on the penis, and it is an emergence of unsightly flesh.
And of these, some are malignant, and others non-malignant.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine hook, and cut it away until you have cleaned it all away.
Then place upon it cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Then treat it afterward with diafinicon ointment until it heals.
But if the Albather is malignant, of foul color, then you should apply cautery to it after cutting and scraping it.
If however the Albather is on the foreskin of one uncircumcised, and part of the Albather is between the foreskin and part of it outside: then you should first remove the Albather that is inside, until when it heals, then treat it externally: because when you treat it all at once, the foreskin is not secured from being perforated.
And blackening and corruption also occur in the testicles and foreskin.
Therefore, you should hollow out all that has already blackened, and what is about to corrupt, or has already corrupted.
Then spread over it afterward honey that has been mixed with powder of pomegranate peels, and sifted ground vetch.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
If however there occurs a flow of blood, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is beneficial for two conditions simultaneously, namely for blood flow, and when the wound becomes corrupt.
But if the head of the penis is corroded, and is completely destroyed in an hour: then you should insert into the urinary passage a small tube of lead, so that the patient may urinate through it.
Regarding adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion indeed does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required on it: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound or abscess: therefore you should separate it with a blunt spatula until the attachment is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides.
But if it is difficult to separate them precisely, then you should scrape something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
This is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it becomes perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate between the foreskin and head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has been moistened in cold water, so they do not adhere again.
Then let it be treated with astringent wine until it heals.
On the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of errors occurring to them.
Chapter 57.
Circumcision is not a break in continuity like other wounds: however, since it is done by our operation, by our will, and its practice is specifically for boys, it is necessary that we indicate in it the better operation and the easier way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: since they do not use it in their laws, and it is nothing except what we have acquired through experience.
Which is because I found the greater part of practitioners and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors: and they use the thimble, and binding with thread, and cutting with a fingernail.
And I indeed have already tested all these methods, and have not found better than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread.
Since in cleansing with a razor, many times the skin escapes.
Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower membrane remains: thus one is forced to cut to cut the other, and future pain.
And with cleansing which is done through the thimble, that is, the finger-guard which cobblers use, the cutting of the extremity of the male member is not secured: since perhaps it enters into its opening.
In cleansing with the fingernail, perhaps the iron slips and corrupts your operation: and indeed a boy's skin is naturally short, and many times they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have seen this.
However, cleansing with scissors and binding with thread, good experience has revealed to me: since scissors are of proportional cutting: because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Therefore when you press your hand, the two sharp edges are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation in one time: and the compression happens in a similar figure, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, with which error does not occur at all.
And the mode of proper operation is that you make estimate, especially the boy, if he is among those who understand a little, that you do nothing except that you bind a thread on his penis only: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him happy and joyful in every way possible for you, from that which his understanding receives.
Then make him stand between your prepared hands in position, and let him not be sitting: and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, lest the boy see them at all, or any of the instruments.
Then introduce your hand to his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it upward, until the head of the penis comes out.
Then clean it from that which gathers in it of dirt.
Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Afterward bind a little below it with a second binding.
Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower binding with good retention, and cut between the two bindings.
Then lift the skin upward quickly, and extract the head of the penis.
Then let the blood run gradually (for it is better) and put powder above: and above the powder a cloth in which has been spread egg yolk cooked in rose water, mixed with fresh good rose oil: and leave it upon him until another day: and treat him with the remaining treatment until he is healed.
However, this is the form of scissors for cleansing.
Let the two extremities be blunt, and let them be cutting: let no branch of nail protrude in them: and let the length of the two sharp edges be like the length of the two handles equally.
Indeed the error falling in cleansing is: since perhaps the inner skin escapes entirely, or part of it during cutting.
Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your time with your nail before swelling of the place: and cut it according to equality.
But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
If three days have passed, and what remains under the penis is swollen and inflamed: then leave it until the hot inflammation subsides, and carefully remove the skin, and cut it according to what is prepared for you: and be careful of the head of the penis.
Indeed this will not harm him.
Therefore treat it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders, which we described in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut from the skin above measure, and escapes to the upper parts, this also does not harm him.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it heals.
¶ On the extraction of Urine retained in the bladder.
Chapter 58.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from blockage caused by stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh growth, and similar things from those which we mentioned in the types of treatment in the division.
And if the Urine is not released, and you see its retention is because of a Stone, which is now in the neck of the bladder: then the patient should be on his knees bent over.
Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as possible for him.
Therefore he is compelled with the neck of the bladder to expel the Stone to the posterior: whereby the Urine is released.
But if it is not released with what we have said, and the matter becomes severe for the patient: then you must administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's feather quill in the thinness of its shaft, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: which should have a thin tube at its head.
And the method of urine's exit through it is that you should take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton at its end with a good knot: and insert the end of the thread in the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with scissors if anything from the wool protrudes, but insert it into the tube with force, like alzer.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and have the patient sit on a seat, and bathe the bladder and his penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the penis carefully, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Then double it above from the region of the navel.
Then push the syringe within it, until it reaches the Bladder, and the patient feels that it has already reached an empty space: and this does not happen according to this order, except because the passage, in which it goes, is one in which there is tortuosity.
Then extend the thread with the wool gradually.
For the urine will follow the wool.
Then extract it, and make the Urine flow through the urinary path: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease doing this, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ On the method of administering an enema to the bladder with a Clepsydra.
Chapter 59.
When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus becomes confined in it, and you want to instill waters and medicines into it: then it should be done with an instrument which is called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
For it is deaf, that is, closed.
And in it there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the hollow space, in which is that which pushes, should be of such size that it blocks itself without addition, until when something is drawn with it, from the fluids it is drawn up: and when it is pushed, with it it is expelled to a distance: just as does the clepsydra, with which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is thrown in the battles of Mars.
Therefore when you want to inject fluids into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the fluid, and draw with that which pushes upwards, for the fluid is drawn into the cavity of the clepsydra.
Then insert its end into the penis, according to what we described in the syringe.
Then push the fluid with that which pushes for that fluid reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it.
Form of the fine clyster with which the bladder is given an enema.
Let it be made from silver, or brass: whose higher end should be similar to a small alcama, and below it a cavity between which the ligament may fall.
Then take a ram's bladder, and put in it the fluid with which you wish to give an enema to the bladder.
Then bind it between two cavities with a strong binding with a double thread: and warm that fluid a little over fire.
Then insert the end of the clyster into the penis, afterwards squeeze your hand over the bladder with the fluid with proper pressure, until the patient feels that the fluid has now reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment, and make from it a circle, and perforate it around its whole circumference.
Then insert a strong thread in those holes, as they are wound around.
Then gather the circle, as the alsofratu is gathered: after you put in it what you want from fluids, and oils, and waters.
Then bind it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand, until the fluid reaches the bladder.
¶ On the extraction of Stone.
Chapter 60.
We have already spoken about the division of types of Stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have spoken about the difference between Stone generated in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs of all that: and I have spoken about Stone in which operation by hand and cutting is appropriate: and it is Stone generated specifically in the bladder: and that which becomes fixed in the penis: and I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that Stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in boys.
And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its thinness: and white sand appears in it, and the patient rubs his penis, and struggles with it, and many times it hangs down.
Then it becomes erect, and the anus comes out with it in many of them.
And the healing of boys is easy, from it until they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in old men.
In young men however it is intermediate, in what is between that: and he whose Stone is larger, treatment is easier: and if small, its treatment is the opposite of that.
Therefore when we come to treatment, it is necessary first that we clean out the patient with an enema, which extracts all the feces that is in his intestines: for it sometimes prevents the finding of the Stone during examination.
Then let the patient be taken by his feet, and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the Stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or let him jump from a high place several times.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder becomes inclined downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him from the outside.
If therefore you feel the Stone in the space, then proceed immediately with an incision over it.
If it cannot be felt under your touch at all, then you must clean the index finger with oil of your left hand, if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if it is a grown youth: and insert it into his anus, and search for the Stone, until it comes under your finger: and gradually turn it toward the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outward toward the place where you wish to make the incision: and instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to pull the testicles upward with his right hand: and with his other hand, to remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is.
Then introduce the cutting Spatula, whose form is this.
And make an incision in the area between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, but to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be over the stone itself, with your finger in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the external cut is wide and internally narrow, according to the size that would allow the Stone's exit, no larger.
Perhaps indeed the finger that is in the anus compresses the Stone at the incision, and it exits without difficulty.
And know that among Stones there are those that have angles and edges, which makes their exit difficult because of that.
And among them are smooth ones, similar to an acorn, and round: and their exit becomes easy.
For those that have angles and edges, increase the incision.
If it does not exit thus, then you must devise a way to deal with it: either grip it with a suitable instrument whose tip is like a Moon, which grips the Stone and doesn't let it escape: or introduce beneath it a thin instrument with a curved end.
If however you cannot manage it, then widen the opening a little.
If some blood overcomes you, stanch it with vitriol.
If the stone is more than one, then first push the large one to the mouth of the bladder.
Then cut over it.
Afterward push the small one after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut over it with a large incision.
For one of two things happens to the patient, either he dies, or continuous urinary dripping occurs: because the area does not heal completely.
Rather, manage its expulsion until it exits: or devise a way to break it with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: to calm the hot swelling.
Then lay the patient back on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When therefore you have loosened it, bathe the area with water and plenty of oil.
Then treat it with diaphoenicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.
If however there occurs in the wound increased hot swelling, and erosion, and similar things: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented because of it: and this is recognized by the exit of blood with urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it leads to corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and counter each type with what is suitable from the treatment, until it heals.
And it is necessary during all hours of treatment to bind the two thighs together, and gather them, because of the medicines which are placed over the area.
If the stone is small and is lodged in the passage of the penis, and gets stuck there, and blocks the exit of urine: then treat it with what I will describe before you proceed to cutting.
For many times you may be spared from cutting through this treatment, as I have indeed proven it.
And it is that you should take a Perforator made of iron from Africa, which has this form: with a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and tie the penis with it below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating iron into the penis carefully, until the Perforator reaches the stone itself: and rotate the Perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and attempt to perforate it until you make it penetrate through the other side.
For the urine is released immediately.
Then press your hand over what remains of the stone on the external part of the penis.
For it breaks and exits with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for you, due to something that prevents it: then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Then cut above the stone in the penis itself between the two ties.
Then extract it.
Afterward, loosen the binding, and clean away the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
And the binding of the thread below the stone is only necessary so that it does not return to the bladder: and the other binding above, only so that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upward, so that it returns upon your completion and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ On the Extraction of Stones in Women.
Chapter 61.
Stone rarely forms in women.
But if a stone occurs in any of them, then the treatment is difficult and is prevented for many reasons.
One of them is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin.
And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a doctor, when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially operation by hand.
And the fourth is the distance to the location of the stone: wherefore it requires deep cutting, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity drives to that, then it is proper that you take a female physician, well-knowledgeable: and few are found.
But if you are deprived of her, then seek a chaste, skilled physician, and present a midwife well-trained in women's matters, or a woman who in this art suggests a portion of skill: therefore make her present, and instruct her especially, that she do everything that you instruct her regarding the investigation of the stone.
First what is necessary, is that she look if the woman is a virgin: then it is proper that she insert her finger into her anus, and search for the stone.
If therefore she finds it, let her constrain it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the patient, and investigate the stone, after she places her left hand over the bladder, and compresses it with good pressure.
If therefore she finds the stone, then it is proper that she gradually move it from the orifice of the bladder downward with the full extent of her strength, until she arrives with it at the root of the hip.
Then let her cut above it at the opposition of the middle of the vulva at the root of the hip, from whichever part is prepared for her, and feels the stone in that part: and let her finger not be removed from the stone, constraining under it: and let the cut be small at first.
Then let her insert the probe over that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then let her increase the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone exits from it.
Know that there are many types of stones.
Among these there is small and large, smooth and rough, long and round having branches.
Therefore know its types, so that through this you may be informed about what you want.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add ground vitriol to the place, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stopped.
Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and prepare with you the instruments which I mentioned for extracting stones in men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the discharge of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with bandages with proper binding: and do not change it: and leave the stone, do not extract it.
For perhaps the sick woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ On cutting for watery Hernia.
Chapter 62.
A watery hernia is nothing but a collection of fluid in the white sifac [membrane], which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called sifac.
And sometimes it is in its own proper membrane, which nature prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is thought: that it is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we mentioned: and this happens only rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter flows to them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
And this fluid has many colors.
For either its color tends toward yellow, or it is bloody red, or murky, black, or it is watery white, and this is what is more common.
And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
For if it is in the white sifac which we mentioned, then the swelling is round with slight length like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, since the fluid contains it on all sides.
And if the fluid is in its own proper membrane, then the swelling is round with part of the egg, and because of this one thinks that it is another egg.
And if the fluid is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under perception.
When therefore you want knowledge of the color of the fluid, then test the color of the fluid in the swelling with the square probe, whose form preceded.
According to that therefore which comes out in the trace of the probe, judge what is within it.
When therefore we come to treatment with the iron [surgical instrument], then it is necessary that you order the patient to be bled if that is possible for him, and you see his body is full.
Then let him lie back on his back on something slightly elevated, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit you on his left, and order the assistant to sit on his right, who should extend his penis to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the abdomen wall.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, up to near the pubis: and let the cut be according to the straightness of the parallel line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the containing white sifac: and excise it and observe, or beware of this, that you cut it: and let your excision by which you excise it be from the part which is suspended with the egg more: and carefully scrutinize with the excision according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then perforate the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Then separate between the two lips of the cut with hooks, and extend the sifac upward, and do not touch the containing skin of the testicles: and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either in its totality, or piece by piece, especially its thin side.
For if you do not carefully examine in cutting it, there is no security that the water will not return.
But if the egg proceeds outside from its skin at the time of your operation: then when you will have completed the cutting of the sifac, return it.
Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with suture.
Then treat it like other wounds, until it heals.
If you find the testicle corrupted by another blackness, then you must tie off the vessels which are the suspensory, fearing blood flow.
Then cut off the testicle with its suspensory, and remove the testicle: afterward treat it as we have described.
If water is collected in both parts, then know that there are two hernias: therefore cut the other part just as you did in the first one equally.
And if it is suitable for you to make it one operation, then do so: then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the abdominal wall: and place folded cloths above, which are small cushions: and tie them above with a bandage, which has six [parts] according to this form.
Then let two cloths be taken and sewn, and filled with carded wool, according to this likeness: and let the ends which press be made from cotton, or moist wool: and let them be gathered with tightness in the waistband of the breeches: and let one end extend over the anus up to the back, and the second extend to the pubic region: and two ends over the two thighs below, and two other ends over the two groins, and let all the tightness be gathered in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is skillfully treated with cautery in place of cutting with iron: that is, take a fine knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have described: until when the white membrane containing the water is exposed: then take a cautery, according to this form.
It resembles a Greek letter.
Then pierce that membrane with it while it is heated, until all the fluid comes out.
Then stretch the membrane with hooks, and strip it away with a fine heated cautery, and cut it as much as is possible for you, until you remove all of it.
And be careful of the testicle, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with cutting.
If however during the time of cutting, or during the time of cautery, you encounter opposition from a hot swelling, or blood flow, or something else: then you must treat whatever opposes you from that with the treatment that suits it, according to what was previously stated.
If however the patient is fearful, and does not await this operation, because of its horribleness: then perform the perforation according to what I describe: which is.
When it is certain to you through what we said about the signs, that the hernia is watery: then you must have the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then pierce the swelling in its lower part with a broad spatula: and make the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place cotton on the spot, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water runs out: then treat it until the wound heals.
If however there is resistance to the water's exit at the time when you pierce it: and this is only because the white membrane creates resistance at the opening of the wound, and prevents the water's exit: then you must insert a quill into the wound, or the instrument with which dropsy water is extracted, whose form was described before: or increase the operation of the wound slightly.
And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or thereabouts.
Therefore when it collects, let it be pierced in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ On the treatment of fleshy hernias.
Chapter 63.
Know that in cutting into this hernia, there is a fear leading to destruction in most conditions.
Therefore it seems to me better to leave it alone than to operate on it.
And I am recalling the operation for it, and the types of swelling.
I say therefore, that many swellings occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed: and this happens from many causes, namely:
Either from sharp or acrid excess fluid, which flows down to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the swelling matches the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a heavy swelling.
And perhaps it is a stone-like swelling, whose color is dark, and it has no sensation.
And sometimes it occurs from knotting of arteries, and their inflation: as has already been mentioned before: or from inflation of veins.
That which is from inflation of arteries is recognized by the condition of the swelling, when you compress it with your fingers.
And you should not touch it at all.
That which occurs from inflation of veins does not disperse at all when compressed with fingers.
And it is indeed possible that an incision be made on this type and on the remaining flesh: that is, that you cut the skin of the testicles.
Then pull the egg upward, and extract it with the white membrane: and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie off the vessels: and cut the suspensory after you free it from every part of the egg parts.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those grown flesh parts, then you must pull the egg and cut it.
And if there is adhesion between any part of the membrane, or in what is between the vessels: then you must free all that adhesion, and cut it with a circular incision.
If however there is flesh growth in the place of adhesion which is behind: then you must cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we said.
When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ On the treatment of hernia which is with Vine.
Chapter 64.
Vine is a swelling wrapped in a certain wrapping, similar to a grape cluster, with softening of the testicles: and movement and exercise become difficult for the patient, and walking.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which was mentioned before.
But it is necessary that we describe the operation for it according to what the ancients did.
I say therefore, that you must have the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then push the suspensory of the testicles downward.
Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the vessels that are near the penis: and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with strong extension.
Then cut with a broad sharp spatula a transverse incision in line with the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then peel back from every part, as we told you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Afterward fix in them a needle in which is a double thread, and tie it in the first of the places where the Vines occur: and tie it again in the last of them.
Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is collected from the corrupt feculent fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which you want pus to form, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles fall off.
For there is no harm in that.
If however Vine occurs in all vessels, then you must extract the testicles with the vessels because of this: so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and wastes away, or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
On the Treatment of Intestinal Hernia.
Chapter 65.
The occurrence of this hernia is from a tear that happens in the peritoneum stretched over the belly in the region of the groin from the abdominal wall.
Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from the peritoneum, or from its stretching.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or jumping, or shouting, or lifting a heavy object, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from stretching of the peritoneum:
It is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and the swelling is even towards the depth: because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign when it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that it causes from its beginning a sudden severe pain: and the swelling is irregular, appearing close under the skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its path to the outside of the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum comes out with the intestine: and this is called intestinal and omental hernia: and sometimes it occurs with gas.
And sometimes feces run into the intestine, and are retained there: and with this is the patient's peril: since it causes terrible pain, and especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this disease with iron [surgery] there is fear: therefore one must be cautious of mishap in it.
And the method of operation is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand to the interior of its cavity, if it submits to return.
Then he should lie back upon his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Then stretch the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut the whole skin of the testicles lengthwise.
Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and let the incision be of such size that it is possible for an egg to come out through it.
Then strip away the covering membrane and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard peritoneum is exposed from all sides: then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between the white peritoneum, which is under the egg's skin, and between the second peritoneum, and free with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inward with your right hand: and with this pull the white peritoneum upward with your left hand: and lift the egg with the peritoneum to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to pull the egg upward: and you release the adhesion which is behind with complete separation.
And search with your fingers so that there is not anything there from the intestine wrapped in the hard white peritoneum.
But if you find something of it: then push it down into the belly.
Then take a needle in which there is a thick thread, made into a wick from ten threads: and insert it at the end of the peritoneum, that is, of the membrane which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the ends which protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over others in the form of a cross: and tie with them the peritoneum, of which we spoke, which is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until none of the vessels which nourish them can send anything to them: so that no hot swelling occurs from it.
And place again a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers.
And after these two ligatures leave from the peritoneum, which is under the skin of the testicles, the quantity of the size of a finger: and cut all the rest according to the circle, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles an incision, from which blood and pus flows: as we narrated in what was presented before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place in the wound: and apply the ligature which we described.
And sometimes the white peritoneum which we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision fearing the flow of blood.
For many times that happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling is delayed, then foment it with hot water: and place upon it that which we mentioned, until it falls.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it heals.
¶ Concerning windy hernia.
Chapter 66.
In this type of hernia, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron [surgical instruments].
And indeed the ancients said that it is done as we described in the hernia which is with the vine.
That is, that you should bind the vessels after cutting above them with care below: then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with what opens it, until the vessels fall off: and treat the wound, according to what we said, until it heals.
¶ Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groin.
Chapter 67.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all times: but if time prolongs with it, the fissure in the peritoneum increases, until the intestines descend into the peritoneum.
And this occurs from the extension of the peritoneum, which is in the groin, as we said.
That is, because the peritoneum stretches: then it softens, and the area swells, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with cautery, as was previously described.
And sometimes it is treated with iron [surgical instruments], in this way: that is, that the patient should lie on his back between your hands.
Then cut the swollen and protruding area of the rupture, with a cut across the width, about three fingers wide.
Then compress the peritoneum and what is under the skin, until when the white peritoneum that is under the skin following it is exposed.
Then take a probe, and place it over the protruding area of the peritoneum, and press it toward the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two protruding places over the end of the probe from the peritoneum, and bind them together with sutures: then remove the end of the probe.
And do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor stretch an egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Then treat it with treatment of wounds.
When you therefore cut the threads, clean it, and restore the wound, until it heals.
Indeed the peritoneum contracts, and the protrusion of the rupture does not increase.
And cautery is better in this place: since it is closer to safety.
¶ Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter 68.
Often the skin of the testicles becomes soft in some men, because the flesh between them softens, and its appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore it is necessary for one who is asked to treat it, to make the patient lie on his back, and cut all the skin that has softened above the natural skin.
Then join the two lips with sutures: and if you wish, first sew the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Then cut between the sutures.
Then treat with the treatment of other wounds, until it heals, and the threads fall out.
¶ Concerning Castration.
Chapter 69.
Know that Castration in our law is excommunicated: and because of that it would be permitted for me not to mention it in this book of mine: and its mention is not necessary, except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the physician's knowledge when he is asked about it: and that he should know its treatment when it happens to someone.
And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals, for our benefit through that, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
I say therefore, that Castration is done according to two methods.
Either through crushing.
Or through splitting and cutting.
In that which is done through crushing, the way of operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water, until its testicles soften, and become smooth, and hang down: then crush them with your hand, until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castration through splitting and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory, and cut above each egg with one cut, until when the two eggs come out: then cut them after you have skinned both, and do not leave on them any of the peritoneum except the thin peritoneum, which is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done through crushing: since crushing perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
On the treatment of two types of Hermaphrodites.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite in men exists in two forms.
One of them is when there appears in the following space, or in the skin of the testicles, in what is between the two testicles, a structure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In women however there is one type, and it is when a woman's vulva above the pubic area has what look like very small male testicles, protruding outward: of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three types, two in men and one type in women, is: that you should cut away the additional flesh until their impression disappears.
Then treat them like other wounds.
In the second type in men, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
On cutting the Clitoris and protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Chapter 71.
The clitoris sometimes grows beyond what is natural, until its appearance becomes unsightly and ugly: and sometimes in certain women it grows so much that it expands like in men, and reaches the point of coitus.
Therefore you should hold the excess of the Clitoris with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it: and do not cut too deeply, especially at the deep root: so that bleeding does not occur.
Then treat it like wounds, until it heals.
The grown flesh is flesh that grows in the opening of the womb, until it fills it: and sometimes it extends outward like a tail: and because of this some of the ancients call the condition "tailed."
Therefore we should cut it as we cut the Clitoris, and treat it until it heals.
On the treatment of Alratica, which is an unpierced woman's vulva.
Chapter 72.
Alratica is when a woman's vulva is not pierced, or has a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
The accidental type is from a previous illness: and it indeed occurs either from additional grown flesh, or from thin or thick membrane: and occurs either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents coitus and pregnancy, and birth, and sometimes prevents menstruation.
And knowledge of it comes through the midwife's examination, if the blockage is visible and close.
If however it is not visible, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
If however the blockage is from thin membrane, and is close to the two lips: then proceed quickly, and break it open.
And it is done by placing cushions under the two lips.
Then place the index fingers of your two hands together, and the woman should lie on her back with her legs spread.
Then stretch the two lips forcefully, until the thin membrane breaks, and the blockage opens.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman have intercourse every day, so that the area does not heal over again.
If however the membrane is thick, dense: then you should cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If however the blockage is from grown flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and have with you medicines that stop bleeding without causing pain, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then apply a wide lead tube, so that the wound does not heal too quickly, keep it there for several days: and apply a dry linen wick, then treat with the remaining treatment until it heals.
And sometimes other flesh growths occur in the womb: therefore they should be cut according to this method: as long as it is not a cancerous tumor for a cancerous tumor that is in the womb should not be opposed with iron at all.
