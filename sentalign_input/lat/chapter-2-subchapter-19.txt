On the reduction of Arissati to the nose.
Chapter 19.
The physicians call Arissati a fistula, which you treat with cautery, or with a sharp, burning medicine, as was previously described.
And if it does not heal, then there is no further recourse except to cut open the swelling at its origin and extract all the moisture and pus within it, until the bone is exposed.
When the bone is thus exposed, and you see decay or blackening on it, then scrape it with a tool of this shape.
It is called Asperi capitis.
It should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round like azir, marked with fine notches made by a file or by a precise aliskilfer marking, and place it on the decayed part of the bone.
Then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand lightly, until you know that the decay has been scraped away; do this several times.
Then restore the area with drying, astringent medicines.
If the area thus heals, flesh grows in it, and the discharge stops; if it remains for forty days without recurrence, swelling, or complications, then you know it is healed.
If not, then there is no remedy except to redirect the fistula to the nasal opening, following this procedure.
And it is done by exposing the secondary bone with a blade or sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, take a drill in this shape, with a triangular iron end, and its wooden handle tapered to a point, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself, near the lacrimal gland; and extend your hand slightly away from the eye.
Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone, and the patient can feel it, as he notices air escaping from it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Then restore the area with drying, astringent medicines, as I have taught you.
When flesh thus grows, and the area hardens, then the matter that was discharging externally will return to the nose; this will be easier for the patient.
