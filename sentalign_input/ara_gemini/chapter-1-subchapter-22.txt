Chapter twenty-two on cauterizing pigs.
If the swellings are due to phlegm and cold humors,
and they do not respond to maturation with medications,
and you want rapid maturation,
then heat the hollow iron, which is pictured here:
Perforated at both ends so that the smoke may come out of the other end during cauterization.
Place it, protected, on the tumor itself once or twice if needed, until you reach the depth of the tumor.
If the tumor is small, make the cautery iron the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton dipped in fat on it until what was burned by the fire disappears.
Then treat it with the ointment and wicks until it heals, God willing.
