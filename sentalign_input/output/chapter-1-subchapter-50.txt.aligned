The treatment of canker sores by cauterization	On cauterization for cancer.	0.44995213
When a canker sore first appears, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all the way around the canker sore.	When the cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to arrest it, burn all round the circumference of the cancer with the circular cautery.	0.7614734
And yet, the wise say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the canker sore; however, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it may become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen this happen sometimes; and it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around it, with the cautery called "circular," as we have said regarding cauteries.	Some doctors have said that it may be cauterized with one extensive cauterization in the middle. This hardly seems right to me, for I should expect it to ulcerate out; which I have several times seen. So it is correct to burn around the circumference with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.	0.6799592
