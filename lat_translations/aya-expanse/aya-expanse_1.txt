Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Having thus completed this book for you, which is the last on medical knowledge with its additions and having reached the end through his explanations and statements, it has seemed to me fit to complete for you also this treatise, which is part of the operations, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery with the hand is neglected in our area and entirely private in our time, until perhaps knowledge of it perishes and its traces are lost; and nothing remains from it except for small descriptions in ancient books that have been altered by hands; and errors and hesitations occur until intentions are closed and sight of it has faded: It has seemed to me appropriate to revive it with the order of this treatise according to explanations, statements, and abbreviations; and to combine it with the forms of cautery instruments and other work tools; with additions from declarations and necessary elaborations.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	However, since a good craftsman of this art with his own hand is not found in our time, it is: for the art of medicine is long, and its author needs to be exercised in anatomy before he relates what Galen narrated, until he knows the members' aids, their forms, their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, tendons, the number of them, their exit, and the pulsations and quietude of vessels, and the exits of places.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this reason Hippocrates said that the name is much with the name and little with the work, and above all in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have indeed already spoken of that in the introduction to this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For those who are not aware of what we have said about anatomy, they will not benefit from our teachings and may fall into errors that harm people; as I have seen many among them who are proud of this knowledge but lack understanding and experience in it.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	This is because I have seen a careless physician cut into a scrofulous nodule on a woman's neck and he pierced some arteries in her neck; consequently, the woman's blood flowed until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen another physician who presumptuously tried to extract a stone from a man who was old and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore approached him and extracted the stone with a smooth forceps.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed, I had been called to extract it as well; and I saw from the size of the stone and the frailty of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I have seen another physician who was receiving a fee from a certain duke of our land for his medicine; and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him that there was a fracture in his thigh near the calcaneum: and the physician, because of his ignorance, tightened the fracture over the wound with bandages and tight lacing, and did not allow the wound to heal.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	He then completed it according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	After a few days, he sent him away and ordered him not to loosen the ligature. And so it remained until the swelling in his leg and foot went down, and it led to his ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore summoned to him, and I went to loosen the ligature, and peace came, and he was delivered from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption was already confirmed in the member, and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So the corruption ceased its progression through the member until it led to his demise.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who continuously perforated the cancerous abscess, and it festered for days until the evil of his disease became magnificent in the presence of its owner.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	This is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it should not be approached with iron at all unless it is in a member that can tolerate it, so that it may be cut off entirely.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of that, it is necessary for you to know that surgery with the hand is divided into two parts: the operation that is associated with safety; and the operation that involves danger in many positions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already examined in every place of this book, where the operation comes, which holds terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why is it necessary for you to be careful of that and give thought to yourself; so that the foolish do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take care with caution and protection, and tend to your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading to grace from God for a commendable health and succession: and leave behind terrible afflictions difficult to heal, and free your hearts from what makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter into your faith and convenience.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	It is indeed more remaining to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen indeed said in some of his advice.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness; do not call a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	But this Treatise is divided into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On precautions regarding fire, and precautions with acute medicine, chapters, and arranged from head to feet, and forms of tools, and tools for cautery: and everything necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On section and perforation, phlebotomy and venipuncture, and wounds: the extraction of arrows and similar objects. And all the chapter, arranged according to the order of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, dislocation, and treatment of twists, and similar conditions: a chapter arranged from head to foot, according to the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.

Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the healing and damage caused by cauterization: which dressings are appropriate, and when; and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before we proceed with the details of the operation, it is necessary to speak of the qualities of healing and damaging agents, and in what kind of dressing they should be applied.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore that speech on the quality of cautery aid and its harm is a long and subtle discourse, a science and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	There was also discourse on this by a multitude of scholars, and they disagreed about it; and for me, their brief statements are sufficient, fearing an extension.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore that cautery universally affects every condition that is with matter or without matter; excepting two conditions, which are the hot condition without matter, and the dry condition without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, there is disagreement regarding the hot and dry condition with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some said that cautery is beneficial in this condition.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, namely that cautery is unsuitable for a condition arising from heat and dryness; because fire's nature is heat, and it is unsuitable to be cured by what is hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite said: "Through cautery, a remedy is found for every hot and dry condition that befalls human bodies; because when you compare a human body and its humors to the fire's complexity, you find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I say this by way of his own words: for he has already withdrawn that from me several times through experiment.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, one should not approach it unless they have already been proven and exercised in the last chapter of the art of surgery, and have understood the diversity of human complexes, and the disposition of diseases within them, and their causes, and the accidents that befall them, and the space of time.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	However, as for the other complexes, there is no need to be afraid of them, especially in diseases that are cold and moist.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For indeed all surgeons have come together on these things, and they do not disagree regarding the treatment with cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, my sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with medicine, is because fire is simple, whose action does not reach unless it is directed to the member to be cauterized; and it does not harm another member connected with it, except for a slight injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of the medicine that burns does reach what is elongated from the member, and perhaps it causes to occur in the member a disease difficult to heal, or perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it exceeds.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Indeed, it has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of the service and study of the art, and the pause over the truth of things; and for that reason I am excusing the length of this discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if not, because it is not permissible for this book of mine, I will offer you the hidden secret in the fire, and the quality of the operation in the bodies from which it expels diseases, demonstrated by the philosophical discourse that sharpens your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, my children, that they disagree in the time when cautery should be performed, and set a better time for the wound.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times; for the damage caused by time is submerged in the healing brought about by cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially when cauterization is for pains from necessary pains, strong and urgent ones that do not tolerate delay; for it is feared that from them a greater harm may occur than the minor damage that does not pass due to time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let not your minds, my children, be deceived by the fact that they do not understand, except for common and stupid doctors; namely, that the illness that is healed by cauterization does not always return: and they put forth that conclusion, and the matter is not as they think; for cauterization is not unless at the place of medicine that alters the complexion, and dries up humidities that are causes, wherefore pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization surpasses medicine because of the swiftness of its healing, the excellence of its operation, and the authority of its master: and it is possible that the disease will return within a short period of time, according to the constitution of the patient, the location of his illness, and the strength of its effects; and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities therein; and what arrives at itself through the acquisition from food, and similar causes, unless a disease develops for which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Subtle pain in a member due to a few superfluities and humors, such as cauterization on the tooth because of pain and similar causes, for it is possible that that pain will not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the true speech about cauterization as the last resort of medicine is correct: not to what they themselves intend with it; for they believe that there is no cure that can be effected with medicine, or with anything else after the fire has been applied.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the reality is the opposite of their belief; the intention that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is incorrect, unless we apply methods of treatment to certain illnesses and they do not bring about a cure; then, at the end of the process, we apply cauterization, and it does bring about a cure. Thus, the claim that cauterization is the last resort of medicine arises from the misunderstanding of the common people and many ignorant physicians.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron; they did not say this except because of the equal value and superior quality of its substance, and they said that it does not form a crust at the site of cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	That is not absolutely true; for I have already tried it and found that it does not work the same way in all bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with gold itself is good and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you cauterize with fire using gold over fire, it is not clear to you when the burning reaches the desired quantity because of the red color of gold; and when it turns to itself towards cold, if you add more heat on top, it melts into the fire and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	That is why the artisan falls away from that work; and because of it, cauterization with iron has become for us more convenient and close at hand, from straightness to operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I myself have already arranged this chapter on cauterization according to the chapters; and I have ordered them from head to foot so that anyone seeking something from it will find what they want.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	§ On cauterization, Head in the coronial fold.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here is the translation of the given medieval Latin text:
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is as follows: you should advise the patient to evacuate the wound with medicated solutions that clean the head, three or four times a night, according to the strength of the patient's condition, their age, and their custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct them to make incisions on their head with a scalpel.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have them sit between your hands with their knees against your chest, so that they have placed their hands on their own breast.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of their nose between their eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Whenever therefore your middle finger touches it, mark that place with an unhealed wound.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then use the cautery iron with oil: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the raw side on the marked place with the unhealed wound, slowly drawing your hand down, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly withdraw your hand and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that it has detached from the bone, as much as it takes off the head, or as much as the substance of the herb, then withdraw your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if that does not help, repeat the operation with your hand or another instrument if it becomes cold; until you see the bones I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and moisten the cloth with it, and place it on the wound; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place over it the cloth moistened with butter, and leave it on the wound until the scar from the fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment of four drugs until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They also said that the deeper the wound remains open, the more it emits pus; therefore, it is better and more curative.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized from the mouth to the anus; and hold the cautery until something thick from the bones hardens.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then after that which is hardened from the bone, dig around it; then treat (the wound).
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to use a cautery until it leaves an impression in the bone so deep that the bone falls out, making a shape like a horn; or an instrument that women use to deliver children: and they believe that vapors from the head escape through this opening, and the wound heals over time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	He then treats it until it is consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	However, these two types of cautery are not seen at all in some people according to their fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to release it, I find it better for the health of that very person.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the loss of its natural continuity; as we have witnessed in the other members; and especially when the nature of a sick head is weak, the first type of cautery (i.e., mild/less destructive) is healthier and better for me, and I use it - so act with that one for the sake of health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	§ In the manner of cauterizing the head, it is done in the pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the head and is prolonged in a sick person, using hot compresses, ointments, and purgatives.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one of the cauterizations we have described and does not bring any relief from them, then consider this.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the nature of a sick head is strong and not weak, and it finds a freezing cold, then cauterize with another cautery under that one, rarely (or gently).
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then he cauterizes the very tip of every horn of the skull with a hot iron, so that it does not penetrate the skin and the quantity of bone that we have described is exposed.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And he cauterizes the same with a hot iron in the back of the head, in a place called the "vas" (vessel): and this is where blood flows, and you should raise your wound in this and not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	The patient indeed experiences a severe pain because of it, and a variety of pain from the other cauterizations of all parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say about this cauterization in its place: and it is necessary that there be a cauterization for the horns of the head, and the back of it more gently with a cauterization, which is cauterized in the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	§ Regarding the cauterization of the hemisphere, both with heated medicine as well as with iron.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When there is pain in a part of the head that is acute and intense, or the pain spreads to the eye, and it is relieved by washing with purifying medicines for the head, and the remaining treatment is carried out as I described in the divisions of illness, without removing all of it, then cauterization in that place takes place according to two methods: either cauterization with heated medicine burning, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	However, when a cautery is performed with an acute medicine burning, it is as if you take one tooth from another and strip its own scales, and sever its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain with a phlebotomist's side, until it becomes a place under the skin where the tooth is caught.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore, insert it into that place under the skin until it is hidden: then tie it with a string of moderate tension, and leave it for fifteen hours; afterwards loosen it and extract another one, and leave a gap for two or three days; then put a poultice soaked in butter on top of it until the place forms pus; finally treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do it with certain burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth chapter on burning drugs, then do so.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization of it with iron is indeed in this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The shape of the cautery fire, which is as follows.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a claw because its shape is like a claw, which has something of a spark at the tip, and there is a small eminence in the middle.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it (the wound) in the correct position and hold your hand over it; gradually and quickly withdraw the knife, and let the quantity of flesh removed be equal to half of its thickness.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And withdraw your hand so as not to damage the artery below, which could cause bleeding.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the dressing in salt water and place it over the wound, leaving it for three days; then apply butter to the dressing; finally, treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you see that this half-headache has not healed according to the rule of cautery, apply it again with the tip of a knife.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And burn from the cut artery in this headache, not too deeply or too shallowly.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	§ On the method of cauterizing old headaches.
Caput V.	Head (5th chapter)
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating a headache as we have said in the previous treatment and regarding the divisions of diseases, and if the treatment does not help; and you see that the disease does not respond to what we have said about the first cautery with medicine or with fire, then it is necessary to apply cautery with a knife until it turns white after drawing a sign on the place of pain with a line, whose length should be the thickness of a finger, or approximately; and hold your hand once over it and squeeze until you reach the artery, and then continue until you reach the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to allow the continuation of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, to become hardened on the side or the nerve that moves it, leading to a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And it is also important to pay attention and take care of the flow of blood from the artery that has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	Indeed, there is fear in its amputation, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is neither diligent nor expert, and thus he abandons the operation with it first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come to remember the management of the flow of blood from the artery according to its way and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for it, and you see the body enduring cautery in the middle of the head, as we have mentioned, care for the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, apply cautery, which we said in the chapter on extracting arteries with a cautery tool having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	Cautery is indeed better and more effective with this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	§ Regarding the method of cauterizing in the pain of gold.
Caput VI.	Head VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When a painful chill occurs and it is cured with poultices and the remaining treatment as we described in division, but the pain does not leave, then use a burning iron, which is called "Punctum," shaped as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the points should be applied around the entire ear after igniting it, as it is necessary; or around both ears if pain is present in both simultaneously.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And stretch it with the iron from the root of the ear, after you have marked the areas with wax: and the quantity of the iron should be ten points for every ear, roughly like this.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the areas until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	# On the Method of Burning in Surgery.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The surgery that is cured with burning (cauterization) is only from certain types of conditions arising from phlegm, as we described in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And the burning (cauterization) for these types of conditions, which occur from desiccation and spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this symptom of pain with burning, washing, gargling, and it does not bring relief, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cautery instruments: one at the root of the ear, the second a little below its natural position, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery instrument on the opposite side of the injured part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of the cauterization is such that you cauterize with a single cautery instrument at the very end of the upper ear, just below the forehead, and another at a different time, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And hold your hand with the cautery until the quantity of the middle part of the thickness of the skin is burnt.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, whose shape is as follows: however, it is not too thin, as you will see, and it should be that there is a little excess thickness in the knife.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with what has been done until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterization for ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	**Chapter VIII**
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes chronic and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four burns on every horn of his head, and with a burn in the middle of his head, as we have said, and another burn at the back of his head, according to what has been mentioned before; and the manner of cauterization should be as previously described.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	He is also cauterized with a burn over the stomach opening, which is more extreme.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then he should be cared for according to what has been mentioned before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	On the method of cauterization for oblivion.
Caput IX.	**Chapter IX**
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that the patient receives a large amount of water at first, and purifying pills for the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then, wash the entire head of the patient and place a plaster of linseed described in the treatise on plasters on his forehead, and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	Indeed, this is the method of cautery: perform it according to the same order that I mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then perform three cauteries on the posterior part of his head, which are descending from the superior part of the head to the lower part of the eye, and place between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then take care of the cautery, as with what preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If, however, you see the need for an addition, and the patient can bear it: then perform a cautery on him in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you want an addition: then cauterize the middle on top of both horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then take care of the middle until it is healed: and make the cautery oily according to the form that was mentioned previously.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	§ On the method of cauterization in paralysis and softening.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed with the cleansing of the head with herbs and as I mentioned.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Next, he prepares the patient's head: afterwards, he cauterizes the wound with a hot iron in the middle of the head, and on top of every horn of the head, and on top of its rear part, and three times on the spine of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	However, if you need to alleviate the body's pain in multiple places and the patient can bear it and the disease is strong: then cauterize it with four hot irons on the spine of the back, and the last one with a hot iron, until most of its flesh is burned and your hand is withdrawn.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it is healed: and thus the cautery is oiled.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	§ On the method of cauterization for epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	The epileptic is not cauterized unless it is from phlegmatic epilepsy.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the surgeons to examine his brain first with cauterization and with the rest of the care that we have mentioned in division: when the patient is weak or accepts medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then gargles and mouthwashes that purify the brain are given for many days prior, along with the improvement of food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then he should cut off the head, after that he should burn it with a hot iron in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another iron burn on the back of his head, and over every horn of his head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If the patient is strong and tolerates it, he should be burned with the irons I mentioned in the case of paralysis, and softening of the body over the spine of the neck and the spine of the back, and the burning should be done with oil according to the manner that preceded.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	However, if the patient is a young boy, then place the iron gently, according to this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	§ On the method of burning in melancholia.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then burn it with the irons that I mentioned in the case of paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of tears leading to melancholy, and the body is weak and moistened, then give him something that purifies his brain, according to what preceded in the separation: then cut off the head of the weak person, and afterward make a properly shaped torus from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head, and the patient, sitting square, should be held from every side.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better from an ancient butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And warm it gently over a moderate fire until the finger can tolerate it when inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then make a circle of the ointment in the middle of his head, and leave it until it cools.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this for the patient every week, with the rest of his treatment, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if not, cauterize it by making small dots on most of it, besides holding the hand with a cautery; indeed, it smells deeply.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	This kind of cauterization moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then place over it a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	§ In the manner of cauterization, descend water to the eye.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the beginning of the water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I mentioned in the division, then begin and wash the sick person, with that which will cleanse his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard yourself from all humidities, and make him sit in a bath, for several days of fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it over the two temporal regions with two cauteries, if there is a simultaneous seizure of the descent of water in both eyes; or from one side, if there is a seizure of water in one eye. And cut all the veins and arteries that are under the skin with the cautery, and let the cauteries be long in width across the temporal regions; and cauterize to stop the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I come with the wisdom that is in the extraction of arteries, their cutting off, and guarding against the flow of blood.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And when it is cauterized on the skin, under two bones, with the last two cauteries produced.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	On the method of cauterization for ancient tears.
Caput XIIII.	**Chapter XIV**
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are long-standing and excessive, affecting the veins and arteries clearly visible on the outer part of the head, this is due to the overflow of cold phlegm. Then, cauterize with the same iron used in the beginning for the descent of water (i.e., the nasal passages), with an iron in the middle of the head, and two irons above the two temporal regions, and two irons on the forehead beneath the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need further help, then cauterize the eye itself carefully on both sides, above the outer edge of the eyebrow with a small iron.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	On the method of cauterization for nasal pus.
Caput XV.	**Chapter XV**
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with the method we mentioned earlier (i.e., drainage), and treatment does not help: then apply a drink made from weak infusions three nights in a row. Then shave the head and cauterize it with an oil-soaked iron.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize the base with an iron in the shape of a key using two irons above each eyebrow just beneath the hairline.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And guard against the artery, lest you cut it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the form of cauterization of Clauile.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	§ On the method of cauterization for the softening of the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Head XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid is softened from irritation or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery iron, using this cautery in the manner of a crescent moon.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize the very top just above both eyebrows with two iron tools at every part, and they should be extended from two time periods; and the length of each cautery should be according to the length of the eyebrow, and do not apply the final touch with the iron, but rather according to the amount that is hardened on the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of cauterization according to this method of lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	§ On the method of cauterization for the eyelids when the hairs turn sharp and harm the eye.
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	There are two kinds of cauterization in this regard: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	However, in cauterization with fire, first and foremost, the patient should be made to remove any hair that might be burnt, if there are any, until they lengthen and equalize.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they are pricked near their origin: then close the patient's eyes with ointment so that they do not move until they heal.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have healed and equalized, then place the patient's head in your lap; then make signs on the eyelids with wax, in the form of a myrtle leaf, indicating that it is according to the figure of the leaf, and let the sign begin near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a cloth soaked in white of egg or in the mucus of a small grain over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then use fire for cauterization, whose form is as follows.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize according to the shape that you have marked gradually on many parts, until the surface of the skin is burnt, which appears as a myrtle leaf in its own right.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of your work's success is that if you notice the eyelids contracting and the hair growing out at the site of the puncture, then it is a sign of health.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore, release your hand at that time; and let it be healed in three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place a cloth soaked in butter over it until the scar is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply a treatment for it with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of the threads remain after an hour and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cauterization on that spot, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	However, if the threads are below: then cauterize it until it returns to its natural place; and ensure that they do not hurt the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	§ Regarding the cauterization with a burning medicament in that case.
Caput XVIII.	Head XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as if you urge the patient to release the threads until they loosen and equalize.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a form of a myrtle leaf from cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take a known soap, and a piece of unsoaked lime, about an ounce, or something like that; then rub it with gentle pressure at the same time, so as not to chill it.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take a piece of material from that which you have prepared like the form of a myrtle leaf, and place it over one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a cloth soaked in alum, and let the patient's head rest in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medicine, for its sting is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	So long as he continues to feel the sting of the medicine, let it be, and move your finger along with it.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the sting has subsided, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then, if you see the eyelids rising up as they do when a flame or cut is withdrawn, it is good; but if not, repeat the application of medicine over that place where the medicine has not impressed or discolored until your operation is complete and the eye contracted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then apply a cloth with butter over it until the burn on the skin is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with a salve of myrrh or other, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you, when performing surgery, to be vigilant with the final touch, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If after a day the eyelid softens and something from the hair falls into the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of the myrrh leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that human eyes differ in magnitude and size.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that, your consideration should be: and let the way of righteousness not be hidden from him who studies this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	# On the method of cauterization in the tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, because of what we mentioned in the divisions of illness, and your treatment does not bring healing, then you should cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap and hold it with both hands, ensuring it does not move or be agitated while he holds his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place the warm compress infused with a mild poultice or mucilage over his eye, followed by a hot caustic iron in the shape mentioned.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	The cautery iron should be shaped like the curved end of a reed used for writing, and if it penetrates to the other end or tries to lift up, it is improper.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this shape of the cautery iron is better suited for your task.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the abscess if it is open and drain the blood, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the hot cautery iron over it, which is lit with great flame.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold it with your hand close to the cautery iron near the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not stray or disturb the patient; and place the cautery iron on the fat of the eye and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you reach the end of your cautery iron near the mouth, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, as needed; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a poultice with butter and care for it with an drying ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If after more than forty days it does not heal, then apply to it a sharp, corroding medicine until the bone is exposed; and file it according to its own chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some have mentioned first.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Go to the location of the fistula and find it; then insert into that crack a thin needle, that is, a thin cannula, which has this shape.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And melt into it a quantity of a drachma of lead, and hold your hand with the needle firmly, so that it does not move at all, nor run, or let the melted lead reach its eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye a poultice dipped in albumen or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	Lead indeed burns the site of the fistula and heals it with a wonderful cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed by cauterization and treatment, as we have said, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to make a nostril opening and reduce the fistula to flow along the course of the nose, according to which it will return to its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	§ On the method of cauterization in lip cracks.
Caput XX.	Head XX.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times cracks occur on the lip, which are called pilings, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you treat these cracks, as we have said in the division of illness, and cure does not come about, then use a small fire cautery knife, in this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And the depth of it should be according to the thinness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then immediately apply the same fire rapidly into those cracks until the cautery reaches the depth of the cracks.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then apply care with bandage until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the manner of cauterizing a mouth fistula.
Caput XXI.	**Head XX1.**
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of a tooth, or on the palate, or among the roots of teeth; then pus forms and it ruptures; afterwards it scarifies, and pus flows out, creating a fistula; then one must treat it immediately, and not delay cure, so that with the right amount of heat, cauterization be applied to the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the same burning instrument into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand until it reaches deep down to its end, and the very last part; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then take care of it afterward, as we said about treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the infection is drained and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to remove the place and take away the corrupt bone according to what comes to its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	**On the manner of cauterizing gingiva and softened teeth.**
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum becomes soft due to moisture, and the teeth move and are no longer secure, and treatment with medicines does not help, then place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply a heated cautery, whose shape will come after these steps, so that you place a cannula over the tooth and quickly insert the ignited cautery into it; hold your hand for a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire reach the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And withdraw your hand; then repeat the cautery as many times as necessary.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then have the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour; then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	The tooth, having moved, becomes fixed; the softened gum tightens, and the corrupted moisture dries up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	# On the Painful Cauterization of Teeth.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the pain of a tooth is due to coldness, or there is actual frost on it, or the nerve is affected, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the cautery should be applied in two ways: either with butter, or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	However, his cautery with butter is like taking rancid butter and making the wound boil in a metal cauldron or in veins.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth and wrap it around the affected part.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse the wound in hot butter: place it eagerly on the painful tooth and hold it until it becomes numb; then repeat this several times until the strength of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	If, however, you use a cloth or a bandage in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, then put a hot iron on top until the fire reaches deep into the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	His cauterization with fire is to aim for the air tube or the iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And it should be in the body something of thickness so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the lower jaw.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply the cautery fire, which has come together: place it on that tooth and hold your hand until the cautery becomes numb.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be moved, or on that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And for the impression of that cautery, it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good lint and hold it for one hour, after which he should expel it.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with any available extremity according to what is possible, and this is the form of a cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	§ On the method of cauterization in fistulas.
Caput XXIIII.	Head XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When fistulas are affected by phlegm, and cold humors, and do not respond to treatment with medicines, and the limbs cannot digest them quickly, then apply a cautery of fire, whose form is as follows.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	It should have two open extremities so that smoke can escape from the cautery at the other end; and place the flame upon the skin once, and a second time, if needed, until it reaches deeply into the fistula.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the fistula is shallow, then apply the cautery according to its depth.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days and apply a compress of butter on top until the charred part is removed by the heat.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then apply a cure to it with an ointment of the tooth, until the shape of the canal is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	In terms of cauterization for hoarseness, and the constriction of the breath.
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When moisture accumulates over the lung canal, and especially when it is accompanied by a cold complexion, then it is necessary for the patient to be given a solution of medicine first.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then apply cauterization to it at the base of the throat in a depressed area; and be careful, so as not to come across the cautery with the throat or the skin, unless it is necessary.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then apply another cautery to it at the joint of the neck on the last spine, completing its final stage; and let the cautery follow the same manner as the one preceding it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then apply treatment with what has come before until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	In the manner of cauterization for lung ailments and coughing.
Caput XXVI.	Head 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and pulmonary illness are due to cold moistness, and the patient has neither fever nor phthisis, nor is the disease of long standing, then cauterize him with two instruments above the fork in depressed places with cloth or blades.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery instrument in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be a tube according to its preceding form.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if your cautery involves piercing with a cautery instrument called the "Punctum," whose form precedes in the piercing of the ear, then there should be thirty dots or so.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him with what precedes until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Why should the cautery be performed with him when you make one single cut with three cautery instruments?
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	# Regarding the cautery method for the "Titillico" (in shoulder dislocation).
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the helper (i.e., the shoulder blade) becomes dislocated due to moisture and does not return to its place within a reasonable time, until it develops a habit of returning, then it should be reduced with a slight movement that occurs as we have already witnessed it, at this point, it is necessary for you to reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient should be turned over on their back or side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then take hold of the skin, which is on the inner side of the joint, with your left hand fingers; and if the dislocation moves to the inner side,
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then take the burning instrument with two jaws.
Cuius forma est haec.	What is this shape?
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then burn the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the burning will have four burns.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And when the burning is done with an instrument having three jaws, then the shape of the burn becomes six, and the jaws are according to the thickness of the skin.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the shape of the burn with three jaws.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And if one is added to this manner, then there are eight burns.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then put crushed salt on the burn.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the patient lie still to prevent any movement of the limb until it is healed.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it over the humerus with a hot iron, or with many incisions.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For when the joint is stabilized and the moisture removed, then the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	**On the Method of Cauterization of the Stomach.**
Caput XXVIII.	**Head XXVIII.**
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When there occurs in the stomach a mixture of cold and great moisture, until they extract it from its condition, and the catarrhs multiply towards it, and persistent treatment does not help; then the patient should lie on his back, stretch out his legs, and extend his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize it with three hot irons, one under the cochlear breast in the shape of a finger, and two below the two sides of the same iron, until a triangular shape of the cauterized area is obtained.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And stretch it between both so that they do not join when they form pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cauterization should be the thickness of two-thirds of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the incisions be as follows without addition: and if you make a deep incision with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form, then let the cautery be made into one cautery according to the form of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by making points on it that are burned away by this cautery; and it is as if signs are made on the stomach with a point according to the quantity desired when using encaustic; then it is cauterized again with the cautery point; then it is treated with the cure that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	§ On the method of cauterization: Use the cold.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When there is pain in the liver due to cold, moisture, or excessive pressure, until it releases its natural excess and the patient recovers as we said, and does not improve in that condition: then the patient should be placed with his head raised, and three signs made with encaustic cautery according to this form, and the same quantity of burning below the hypogastric region where the elbow of the man reaches; and let there be space between every cautery according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And the quantity of it that is burnt should be according to the thickness of the skin, half its quantity not added; and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already stretched his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of cauterization.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these wounds with a surgical knife when subtlety and caution are on your side in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And be careful not to proceed too far in cauterization, lest the thickness of the skin throughout becomes severe, affecting the whole body and reaching the intestines; because the skin there is thin, so be aware of that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	# The Method of Cauterization for the Liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When there occurs a perforation and you know that this apostema is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic; then if it is in the flesh of the liver, an intense and severe pain appears, without acuity; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, the pain is severe with acuity. And now you see that his treatment has exhausted the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, the patient must lie down on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then follows a drawing of the place of the wound with wax, then a flame of cautery which resembles a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And it is cauterized with one cautery until the whole skin is burned and it reaches healing, until all the pus is drained; then care is taken for its own cure of the wounds, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And this kind of cautery should not be used unless one's study in the art of medicine is prolonged; and by whose hands these illnesses concur with experience several times, then he may dare to perform such operations.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	To be sure, it is better for me to release her.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	## On Cauterization in Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that cautery with roots of aristolochia is used for cold pleurisy according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you receive from the dried roots of aristolochia long roots, one root longer, which is found from that, and it should be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil; and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then apply a hot iron to the space between the fork of the bone and its neck, and with two small irons, make slight inclines underneath, towards the part below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two irons, make slight inclines also between the fifth and sixth ribs towards the rear a little; and with another iron in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three irons from the rear: one in the space between the two ribs; and with two irons on both sides of the chest, below the iron that is between the two ribs.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to press your hand with the iron; indeed, it should be applied to the skin so that it smells clearly.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And certain ancient writers have said that there are men who use an iron like a ray to burn, and they insert it between the ribs until it reaches the spot, and then let it emerge, so that the pus comes out; as we said about the rib of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with the iron, there is a danger that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs at the site, which does not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the manner of cauterizing the spleen's head (32)
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat an illness of the spleen, as we said, by dividing the illness rather than applying treatment directly, then cauterization should be performed on it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of these, one involves making three or four incisions along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the smaller livers (the ones preceding it in order).
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And for all cauterizations, the thickness should be that of a finger, or slightly more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And the method of cauterization, as we said in the cauterization of the liver, should be equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the cauterization; let it be weak, lying upside down on its back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is as follows: having a fire with two burning ends, as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus, raise the skin that is directly on the spleen where the lower left cubit arrives, and make your elevation such that you raise the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two burning ends into it with great force until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then extract the cautery; thus, four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a caustic agent while holding three wounds,
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then, after releasing the pus for many days, care for the cauterization; for it is more beneficial than any other that preceded from treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	§ On the method of cauterization in hydrops.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cauterization should not fall in hydrops, unless it is properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a hydrops with the treatment methods that we mentioned in division, and the treatment does not improve, then you should cauterize the four wounds around the navel, and one wound on the stomach, and another on the epigastrium, and one over the spleen, and two behind the back between the spines, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then, allow the open cauterization to release pus over a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the weak from treatment after cauterization, for it is necessary that two intentions be joined to it; and it will speedily recover with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be curved; it should follow the preceding form. And that of the one with which the back is cauterized should be oil-shaped; it should follow its preceding form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Regarding the method of cauterizing feet and crurs (lower legs).
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they have been bathed in hydrolic water and refilled with citron water: it is necessary that the cautery be applied on the back of the foot at the instep, which is between the big toe and the little finger: then raise your hand with the cautery, without twisting it, and afterward, raise your hand again, without touching it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The citron water will resume its flow, and the cautery should be shaped according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each of the two crurs (lower legs) all the way through, and let the edge of the cautery knife be the shape of the cautery; and make the cautery according to the length of the leg, one below the knee and another lower down, approximately in the middle of the leg; and make two cauteries over every thigh as well; and leave the open cautery without care for a long time, so that some water may resume from it; then tend to the cautery as we have said regarding the others.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Regarding the method of cauterizing inside the abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the entrails is from cold and humors, until the retentive and digestive virtues in the stomach and intestines are weakened, it is not cured by usual remedies but only seems to be so; and you see the patient enduring the burning of excessive vitality. Then cauterize him with a great cautery over his own stomach, as was done previously in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and with four small cauteries around the navel, using a thin cautery or two. And also with a great cautery above the anus, or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	If you observe excessive humors and the patient endures it, then cauterize him with a cautery over the breast and another over the whole body; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	Indeed, cure is effective whose aid does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	**On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.**
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids, or one large one, coming from thick, cold, or corrupted humors, and they are treated as we have said in division, but the cure does not help, then cauterize them with three cauteries over the lower spine just below the hip bone slightly triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled and his food is not digested, and you see his face turn pale, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery as previously mentioned; and with another cautery over his intestines, and another over his spleen with a key cautery; and leave the open cautery for some time. Then tend to him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Regarding the method of cauterizing after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you remove the athelul, then light the cautery that is similar to a radium.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited cautery into the athelul you have removed; and with your final hand movement, continue until the cautery reaches the venous orifice from which the blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many athelul, then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have mentioned.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then tend to them with ointments until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over the ulcer, it is the last resort in treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the instructions given for the section and operation as described in its place, and is frightened away from it, he may perhaps be healed by cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When a fistula therefore occurs with someone and becomes old, pus runs from it, and the corrupted humors (fluids) become worse.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, it is more important that you probe it carefully with a delicate instrument.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then, determine the depth of the fistula with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then, apply the cautery instrument, which is similar to a knife.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then, introduce the burning instrument itself into the fistula, and determine how far the closure went.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And apply cautery repeatedly to it until all the corrupted parts are healed, once, twice, or three times, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And be careful not to burn the nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the urinary body, or to the intestinal body, then guard yourself from these places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not perform this unless there is a fistula in a fleshy part, and you think that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed and the materials are removed from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is already completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if materials do not separate from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a deep corruption of its bone, or as if it were those [materials] returning to their place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	§ On cauterizing wounds.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When there is pain in the kidneys due to cold or excessive heat, and they become weakened because of it, then one should cauterize over them with a hot iron on both kidneys, using cautery with a claw-like instrument whose memory precedes it.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the same heat.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	That is why three lines appear.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be the last resort in treatment.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the vesica (bladder).
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When debility and relaxation from cold and moisture affect the bladder, until it can no longer retain urine, then cauterize it in its lower part, starting at the place where the hairs begin, with a cautery from above and another from below; and let the length of this cauterization be according to the thickness of a thumb. And cauterize the base with a single cautery or two, as needed, following the same procedure as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the matrix (uterus).
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture affect the matrix (uterus), preventing it from becoming pregnant, causing its menses to be disturbed and their onset is delayed, resulting in pain during their appearance, then it should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said regarding the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the lower back or two cauteries; and let the cauterization be done carefully.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing an anch (nerve) in a dislocation.
Caput XLII.	**Chapter XLII**
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the humors of the mucous membrane are discharged into the anch (nerve), they become the cause of its exit from its place; and this is indicated by the foot being prolonged over the other when compared again, and the site of the dislocation is found to be hollow in that place.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the weakened anch (nerve) with a similar circle of cauterization over itself: after you have marked with encaustics around the anches, as required; and so that the anch itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And this cautery, whose form precedes in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize itself with three cauteries, using a large oleary cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be made according to the thickness of the skin throughout all parts.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	**On the method of cauterizing in Sciatica.**
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the joint due to cold and dampness, and this treatment, as we have mentioned in division, does not bring relief or cure, but rather worsens the condition, then it is necessary to dissolve the patient from thick humors with foul pills, or artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	The mode of cauterization in such cases is according to two methods: either cauterization with medications that cause burning, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of these methods is to cauterize the joint itself with three triangular cauteries in this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them deep, either good or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space between each cautery be of the thickness of a finger; and the cautery should be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	However, when a cautery is made in the middle on top of the joint itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four incisions?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you use a circular incision, whose shape precedes the displacement of the ankle bone in the incision, there should be one: so as to make a circle that contains the entire ankle bone.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin throughout.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of incision in sciatica, when the pain is attached to the bone itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then make two incisions above the coxa, over the place where the patient feels pain, and a third incision with your four fingers at the inner part of the calf; this is a scalpel incision.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the incision should be according to the depth of the skin's thickness.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then make an incision there where he feels it, with a point, or three points, or four, or as many as needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates that the pain is below the knee towards the leg, then make an incision there with a single scalpel.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And for this reason, in all your cauterizations, take care so that you do not burn the last nerves or a large artery, and draw it up to the damaged part of the body, or cause contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have seen one and another who cauterized on the surface of the wound and ended up in cauterization, so that the foot was swelled until the tumor spread to it and perforation occurred throughout, and the entire foot became corrupt: then there was a rupture of the abdomen, and death followed.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If there is pain in both parts at the same time, cauterize them both according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise ones have spoken about cauterizing the ankle, of which this is the manner.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar one from iron, whose diameter is half the palm: and it should be near its opening according to the thickness of the finger, or a little less; and within that, a third of its size.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And the space that is between every joint should be of the thickness of a thumb; and the joints should be open from both sides; and their height should be about a knot, or two knots; and make them handles out of well-suited iron within the joints.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is ignited in fire until it blazes and throws off sparks. Then it should be placed over the wounds of the ill-lying patient on his healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, cauterize him with three round burns in one application.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then allow it to heal for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	After that, apply a butter poultice and allow the open wound to heal over many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Says Albucasis, of this kind of cauterization, we make use little because of the appearance of fear towards it and also because we find few who expect from it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is from good cauterization that he who endures finds relief and discovers his place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But when cauterization is combined with medicines, as you make two identical ones having a perforated armillar key, into which descends the hinge of its gate made of iron or metal, in length corresponding to the wall, there are two knots, or rather like them at its height.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be a space between both that is as thick as the finger, open below and above, and it should contain itself inwardly according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then he places it on top of a pillow, with the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly on the pillow.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then make a paste between two circles of warm water heated with fire slightly, and hold it for the duration of an hour: and the patient will bear the bite and its burning, because he himself finds a bite like fire until it subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away the warm water from the wound entirely with sweet water; then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter on it until the burn's blackness is removed; and leave it for several days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last resort in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or the leg: make for it a support that holds water equally as you did for the wound.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the way of hot water; and I have already written about it in the book on rectifying medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take some alkali and unburned limestone, each one-half part; wash both, and put them into a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the amount that will enter itself into the radius: and place under the bottom of the pot another pot drained; and throw over the alkali and lime from sweet water, which will submerge both by the finger: after which compress them well with your hand, and leave the pot until sharp water descends to the lower part of the drained pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then add all that water and throw it over another lime; and continue until it renews itself.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For at that time it will be very sharp and acute, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And there are medicines with which large burns are cauterized, such as pitch, and myrrh, and oak calx with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed relates that an ancient man had a cure for the pain of the hip and sciatic nerve, and he praised it very highly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not need any other cure, and that he was healed at once, until he returned, because perhaps he had gone into the bath to be washed, and came out of it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is taken from the green of a fresh wound; if not found fresh, it is taken dry and raw. It is then heated with some fat and placed over the aching spot, in the thigh or elsewhere, and bound, and left for three hours, or as much or little time as the patient feels relief from the heat.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore the body is cooled, introduce it into the bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain withdraws, and it is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines unless after evacuating the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides said that when the vein of a sciatic condition is cauterized with goat dung, it brings relief; and so the cauterization is made in this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take the wool and imbibe it with ancient oil, and place it over the deep spot that lies between the big toe and the toe next to it, closer to the latter.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take the dry goat dung and burn it on fire until it becomes a charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it upon the wound and leave it until it heals.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore continue doing this until sensation returns to the middle and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of burning is called the vaccine burn.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	**On the burning of the back's pain.**
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back for many reasons, whether from accident or chance, or due to excessive evacuation or similar conditions, through the infusion of cold and moist matter; and a burn does not occur unless only in this particular way, which is caused by the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after evacuation of the infection with foul pills and similar remedies, three lines should be made on the back where there is pain, according to its width, after marking signs with encaustics along every line, five or more cauterizations, according to the quantity that has come from the nurse's tolerance, and then the cauterization is performed at the site of the cauterization point.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize three times with cautery, or four times, using a cautery on the mid-clasp, in this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	**On the method of cauterization in the treatment of gangrene.**
Caput XLV.	**Head XLV.**
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its onset in children is: that a tightness occurs in their breathing at the elevation, and movement; and you will find it in the lowest vertebrae of the back and the knots of its tendons, which have already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you therefore see that, and wish to do that, then cauterize the same with a circular cautery in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery take hold over all parts of the vertebrae equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebrae with a point cautery, make two or three lines, and the points should be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place until it heals as we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, do not administer cautery on the curvature that occurs in nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterization for podagra and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	**Chapter XLVI**
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are caused by cold moistures that extend to any part of the body, and there are pains in the feet, it is commonly called podagra by physicians.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When podagra is caused by cold and the pains do not disappear with usual treatments, then cauterization should be applied to alleviate the pains.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is done by cauterizing the area around the joint of the foot after draining it with many cauterizations, and the cautery should be olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	The form of this [treatment] is as follows.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the surface of the foot, then make them with a cautery point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pains rise up to the knees or other joints, and this happens often, then cauterize the entire knee with three or four cauterizations from every side using the same cautery (a claw).
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	However, if more of this cautery is necessary for you, then cauterize the whole part.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand in the cautery, but rather it should be placed around the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	However, if the pains rise to the knees and back, then administer what we have said from the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pains are only in the hands, then make dots around the instrument with a fire, as two lines are resolved.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	However, if there remains pain in the fingers, then make dots on them, over every knot and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however the pains rise after days to the cubits or shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not force the weak from good regulation, from receiving medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good regulation is done, and the phlegm yields, it will be healed with God's help through this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	# Regarding the Method of Cauterization in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine descends or moves towards the testicle, and it begins to cause pain, then it is necessary that you order the patient to stop eating on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And it should be treated with gentle means so that the faeces can descend from their abdomen.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then make the patient sit between your hands on their back, and order them to hold their breath until the wind or intestine is discharged.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then use your fingers to reduce the swelling, and make a mark with hot wax below the rupture across the rib cage, where the end of the mark resembles half of a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then use a hot iron with this shape until it turns white and discharges pus.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or wind to its normal state.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then the assistant should place their hand over the area to prevent the intestine from escaping, and you, having already opened between the patient's legs and placed a poultice there, should put another on top of it, and another one across their legs and another across their chest holding the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the hot iron over the mark, with your hand holding the cautery tool upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it firmly until you gain access to the mouth with it; or use it again with another application if you have not gained access to the mouth with it at first.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And observe carefully from the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization to avoid burning it, and let it heal through that, over the sick or death, or a great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not gain access to the mouth with your cautery, your operation will not succeed.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery of infants be subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the rest of the ointments until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And the sick person should lie on their back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to provide his nourishment for the duration of his healing time, so as to soothe his bowels; that the intestine does not come out at the effort and expulsion.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then, when you want to rise after forty days, then administer a well-made ligature and hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And it becomes smaller from labor, and from the fullness of food and drink, and from restless conversations.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this regime is used, thus is healed with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the cure for ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When ruptures occur in the remainder of the stomach, and they are incipient, and you see that they do not add up, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and it should be treated as if it were a third of its original size from then on.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then, the cure itself, with what we have said: and it does not add up.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some have said before: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	Afterward, it is sealed with wax, and a line is placed that goes across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line downwards.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery clamp.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the method of cauterizing wounds due to trauma or impact.
Caput XLVIII.	**Chapter XLVIII**
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When, in certain parts of the body, pain occurs due to a wound or impact and it persists for a long time and does not respond to treatment with medications, then it should be cauterized with a point cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the cautery of every member should be according to its size, and its thinness or thickness, and its strength, and its position in torsion, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If it is cured from the first cauterization, then it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cauterization on top of it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because, according to the custom of these pains, they should be transferred from one member to that which is nearest.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore, it is necessary to follow this with cauterization until the sick member is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	**On the method of cauterizing leprosy.**
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX. Head.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But sometimes lepers may be cured by the greatest means of cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And in particular, the type of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: so consider how to cauterize this very condition.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If leprosy is beginning to appear and you have cured it as we stated before, but it does not disappear or recede, and you fear that the corruption has spread over all his skin, then cauterize him with five wounds: one in the center of the forehead, a second below it facing the front near the ends of the hair, two above the horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And with your last hand, apply the cautery for a short while until it leaves a slight mark on the bone and the flesh is dislodged from it, so that the expulsion of the gross humors may be facilitated, and cauterize it again over the spleen, as has been mentioned before.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if leprosy has now spread over the body and appears clearly manifest, then it is necessary to cauterize with these very wounds that we have mentioned on the head, and over the ends of the nose, and two on each cheekbone, and two on the spine of the neck, and six on the spine of the back, and one large one at the place called the great buttock, and one above it, in the same breast, and two over both breasts, one over each shoulder, and two over the elbows, and two over the softness of his chest: and cauterize him also over every joint, from the joints of his fingers and toes; and cauterize him over every heel of his feet, and the soles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And be aware of the nerves that are above the last part of the heel, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes when a burn is caused by a hot iron on the rib bone, another on the stomach bone, and yet another on the epigastrium.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply heat, the greater the relief and the better the outcome.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not experience pain from a burn as those who are healthy do; this is because their body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And the burns should be of the appropriate size and depth according to the members and joints; according to what has been mentioned regarding the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the burns with flour and herb paste with honey, and continue healing until it is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	**On the method of burning in stupor.**
Caput L.	**Head**
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a member is stupored and cured with drugs, oils, and plasters but does not heal, then burn that stupefied member with hot irons according to the degree of severity of the member or its lightness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cauterization be made through the thickness of the skin somewhat.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply the cure with ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when it is cauterized to something that causes a loss of sensation, which happens to the hand and foot, on the spinal bones near the exit of the nerves that move that limb; then the sensation returns.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	Indeed, one should not presume over it unless they are wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	# On the Method of Cauterization in Albucasis.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis is outdated and does not offer anything new from the art of medicine; then cauterize over that cautery deeply somewhat, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then apply the cure with flour of herbs, and meal of lentil with rose oil, and leaves of arni, and blood of pigeon, and blood of hind: take a part from each; mix all these together, and spread them on a cloth, and let it adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterization for cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is just beginning and the ulcer itself is not too large, cauterize it with a hot iron following its curve, as is customary.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	However, some have said that it should be cauterized with the final iron in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not find that to be the case, for I fear it might ulcerate, and I have already seen it several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized along its circumference with a circle, as we said, or with many hot irons.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterization for gangrene.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has gangrene and its healing is delayed because of excessive moisture or old age when the blood supply is scanty, or because of time, and one wishes to hasten the maturation of the gangrene, then cauterize it along its circumference with many small hot irons puncturing it.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then release her.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	She will grow eager as the healing progresses.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If, however, you see an opening in the wound after applying a caustic, then use fire to cauterize it, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it (the caustic) in the middle of the ulcer until it penetrates the skin; and let the cauterization follow from this, as the disease permits, to free the flow of pure blood.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	§ Regarding cauterization in minor corrosions.
Caput LIIII.	Head (of the cautery instrument)
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	The corrosion is nothing but the destruction in a moving member, and it corrupts itself; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see corrosion in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then use many small and large cauteries, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosion exists.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until the entire corruption is eradicated and nothing remains of it deeply.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and place over the burned areas finely ground sulfur mixed with oil, until all the scabs and every corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that nourish the flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	So if you see that after three days the flesh grows with a healthy newness in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization over what remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corrosive (ulcer) is sometimes treated with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It (the healing) itself arises at the site of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cauterization with fire is more useful for rapid healing: and indeed I have already said that cauterization should be done with sharp medicine in division; so take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	§ On the method of cauterization in claws, and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVII.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This affliction often occurs in the lower parts of the foot; it is a serious, deep matter that affects the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed, there is cautery in them according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for when using fire, it is like a heated cautery pen; it should be made of iron, according to the amount that contains the claw from all sides, and it should have thin margins.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the heated iron on top of the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then take the hand with the cautery around the claw, until the cautery reaches the depth of the claw, and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply it with a paste made from crushed garlic mixed with salt, and leave the paste on top overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will indeed be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with a healing ointment made from meat until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not improved, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then apply cautery to them with hot water. And it is as if you take a tube made of copper, or iron, or from a duck's quill, and place it over the claw, or whatever else.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then he pushes a small amount of warm water into the tube. Hold your hand and twist it slightly with the pressure of your hand so that the edge of the tube is pressed against the root of the nail, and the warm water finds its way down to the root of the nail. The patient should wait for about an hour after the application of the warm water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release it, for the nail is eradicated along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with each one after the other until you have passed over all that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been eradicated, using what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	§ On the method of cauterizing in tremor.
Caput LVI.	Head LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When someone experiences tremor due to cold in a nerve, or from quartan fever, or any other cause: then it is necessary to cauterize the tremor with four or five burns on the spine, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and over the breast with a cautery, and over the stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor ceases with hot cautery, and hastens the health of cold disease.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterization, Al-Battar.
Caput LVII.	Head (Chapter) LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes, the body expels impurities, that is, pustules caused by corrupted coarse materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when appearing, it is necessary to cauterize each head of the pustules with a thin iron, the end of which is heated by fire, in the first instance.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of the long aristolochi.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lens cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they (the pustules) are cauterized in this way, after being expelled initially, they do not increase, and the excess is broken off, making them heal.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it should be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterization in the flow of blood from an artery in the vein.
Caput LVIII.	Head (Chapter) LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times there occurs a flow of blood from an artery that has been cut near the wound, which happens externally or near the incision of the scar tissue or cauterization of the member, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to sever it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, if this should happen to anyone, then apply with your proper hand to the opening of the artery, and place over it your index finger: and tighten it much, until the blood is obstructed under your finger, and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place in fire small pieces of oil-soaked material, and many more in great numbers: and blow over them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or a few, or a large one, according to the wound and place where the artery is broken, and apply the cautery over the vein, after which you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood stops.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	Which if it is expelled with the removal of the finger from the opening of the artery, and the cautery is extinguished, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries that are prepared over fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not therefore stop doing this with one after another until the blood stops.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and let not another harm come to the weak.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you should know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to cut off the same; especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or when using cauterization, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or when using extraction, if it cannot be extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends contort and the blood cuts off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or they place over it medicines that stop the flow of blood and tighten it with a suitable constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	He who performs the cutting with a ligature and tightness with cloth, or by positioning things that burn and similar things, does not do it thoroughly, but rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to someone and there is no doctor present nor medicine: then he should begin by positioning his index finger over the wound's vein opening as we described, and tightening it strongly until the blood stops from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be moved from its position until the blood cools and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, he should consider what is needed from cauterization or medicine for that.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	**On Incision, Puncture, and Phlebotomy in Wounds and Similar Conditions**
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	As we said in Chapter One, every sickness that involves the use of fire for cauterization and burning medicine, along with its occasions, causes, instruments, and types of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed chapters there from head to foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path: so that it may be clear to those who seek knowledge about these topics.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, my child, to learn from the fear that is in the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it requires greater caution, since in the operation that is in this chapter, many times there is a loss of blood when opening a vein, or making an incision over a tumor, or opening an exit, or healing a wound, or extracting an arrowhead, or cutting on stone, and similar things; from all of which trembling and fear arise, and in many cases, death results.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, let not that which causes hesitation fall upon you, for at some point they will come to you in this art of human conditions with the conditions of illnesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For some, when afflicted by their illness, they become angry, and for them, death is gentle; because of the remedies they find from their illness and the duration of their malady.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when illness is from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And there are those who give their doctor his due and trust him with themselves, hoping for health, but their illness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not necessary that you give consent to him who comes to you from those whose way is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vigilant than your greed and ravenousness.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume over anything from that, unless after certain knowledge which verifies with you the admirable outcome of what has come to pass.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And apply yourselves to the care of all your sick, with prognosis and indication for what is fitting for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	In that, indeed, lies your aid in acquiring fame and glory, as well as memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	God inspire you, his children, with His wisdom, and do not take away from you guidance and inspiration, for it is in His hands.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed arranged this chapter by distinguishing it into sections, according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization, from the head down to the feet: so that you may find whatever you seek from it, and whatever you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	§ On the healing of water gathered in the heads of children.
Caput I.	HEAD I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this condition often occurs in children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it happens, even due to hidden causes that are unknown.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I myself have not seen this affliction in others as much as in children, and to every one of them death has followed: therefore it has been necessary for me to abandon the procedure regarding it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I indeed saw from them a boy, whose head was filled with water, and his head was magnified every day until he could not sit on himself because of the magnitude of his head; and the humidity increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this humidity, indeed, is either aggregated between the skin and bone or aggregated under the bone on the surface.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that case, if there is humidity between the skin and bone and an aperture is formed, then you need to make a crack of one length across the middle of the head, and its width should be as two knots, until the humidity flows.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a fracture.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If the humidity is therefore increased even more, and the aperture becomes larger, then place these two cracks according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the humidity is under the bone and its sign is that you see the openings of the head commissures from every side, and the water sinks down when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and it does not disappear from your sight, then you need to make three cracks in the middle of the head according to this mode.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the cut, extract all the humidity.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tighten the wounds with cloth and bandages.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then sew it up from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligature, treat the wound with bandages and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not forget to tie the head with equal tension.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak with dry food slightly moistened, until the member is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And there is another way of making an incision, so that you consider where the extent of the abscess appears and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is in the nape, or at the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, ascend with the incision where you see the abscess and the gathering of water: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And beware, do not cut the artery, and let there be no flow of blood, and the weak one may die from that flow with the evacuation of humidity.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	On the incision of arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	**Chapter II.**
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When anyone suffers from cataracts in the eyes or chest, and it becomes chronic and does not respond to medical treatment, then the final remedy is through the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when one decides to incise them, they should remove the sick head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then, using a rough cloth, prepare the area so that the arteries become visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the patient should tighten their weak neck with any cloth they have.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then, consider where the pulse of the vein is.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both [arteries] are the areas that are behind the depressed ears: and they are rarely obscured, except in certain individuals.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark them with wax on both sides; and incise each one with a sharp blade on both sides accurately to the depth of the bone: and it should be done according to the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce a small spatula under the artery and cut it towards the upper parts with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And the length of the incision should be like two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when an artery is incised, blood gushes out with a pulsating force, rising into the inside with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	However, if the artery is not visible to the eye, then it is necessary that the measurements from gold should be three fingers' width in quantity of space.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with wax and find until it reaches the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which needs to be released from blood is six ounces and perhaps you release more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of it according to the amount that appears to you from the condition of the patient and the fullness of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains something to the bone from the surgery, cut it so that it does not cause a hot abscess; then bind the wound with linen bandages.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then, apply a poultice to it and continue to do so until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries, which are found in certain places (the body).
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old hemicranea (migraine) or sudden acute catarrh occurs because of sharp humors and heat in the brain's sinuses, or scrofula, a hard and painful swelling, and similar ailments, and the usual medical treatments do not help, then we resort to extracting the arteries from these parts or cauterizing them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of extraction is to remove the weak hair from these parts and draw out the visible artery.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	Indeed, it (the pulse) reveals itself to you through its own rhythm, and is rarely hidden except in a few people or during sudden chills.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it (the pulse) is hidden from you, then press your weak head with any cloth you have; then, place a rough cloth in the fearful spot.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or apply steam to the place with hot water until it (the pulse) appears manifestly to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a spatula that I formed a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then use it to scrape the skin easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it and pull it towards the upper parts until you extract it from the skin, and make it glide out of the tunics that are under it from all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is thin: then insert it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then make an incision from that part according to the amount that its ends are elongated and contract, so as not to cause a flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not incised and not severed, the blood will not flow completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then pour out the blood from the wound six times using a cup, up to three times daily.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread made of silk or sheepgut, so that it does not flow into putrefaction before the wound has healed, and causes a flow of blood.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then make an incision over the surplus, which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Perform that operation at that time, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you see it, cauterize it with a cautery up to the mouth, with a cautery knife; until its ends are exposed and it remains in place for the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better work unless the patient has fever or is of heated complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Since the cautery is one of those things that help end moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to drain it.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the arteries are extracted, the place should be filled with cooked old flesh; and small neatly made pieces of it should be placed on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the swelling is gone, it should be treated with dried medicines that make the flesh heal, and with liniments, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If meanwhile, while operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then quickly proceed to cut it off with cautery, or fill the place with a pad; and hold your hand tightly until the blood stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those things is present to you, then put your finger on the place until the blood clots.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And with a gentle application of water to the affected area, wait until the acute pain subsides and it tightens as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is softer and easier to extract the artery, it is necessary to cauterize the vein with this cautery that has two knives; and the sharpness of both knives should be similar.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they have much less sharpness than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are as sharp as the two knives, both cause cold; and they do not cut into the flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, since there is a little less hardness in them, heat from fire is retained in them, and flesh is cut off quickly; so with this, it is necessary for every work, and better and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And there should be a space between the two knives equal to the thickness of a finger, after you mark the two places with encaustic; and place both hot instruments vigorously until they reach the vein, and cut into the vein at two places: so that what is between its extremities will be elongated.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not solidify completely with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of persistent acute tearing from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	**Chapter IV**
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are persistent and flow from the eyes, which are situated on the outer part of the skull, and when medical treatments offer no relief; as the patient's face turns red and they experience a tremor similar to that of ants, and their eyes become weakened and watery, indeed, to the point that their hairs are damaged by the constant watering, and the eyelids are inflamed from the acuteness of the tears—then the ancient ones devised a treatment for them, which they called "the knife" (cum Ense).
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is as if you urge the patient to shave the hairs on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then, make three incisions equally spaced along the length of the forehead; the length of each incision should be about two fingers, and one incision should be placed at the middle of the forehead, parallel to the nose, while the second should be a little below the movement of the eyebrows, and the third on the other side. Take care to avoid cutting into the arteries located on both sides. Extend your hand from the continuation of the lower jaw, and the distance between each incision should be about three fingers; prepare a piece of sponge or a dry cloth to absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then, insert the sharp end of the instrument (spatumile) between the two incisions, which will then take on the desired shape.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the temporal part, to the second incision: and the scar tissue, together with it, all the skin which is between the two incisions, with the sutures which are on top of the mouth.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do this also from the median incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatule, and insert another instrument into the first incision again, which is called a sharp knife, one side blunt, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side against the flesh attached to the skin, and its blunt side towards the mouth; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut away with it all the tendons that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision should be continued until what appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure until another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when it flows from blood in equal quantity, express the places from which the clot of blood has formed.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put into each fissure lint made from old cloth, and place over them small pieces soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And observe that a fever does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the ligature and administer a large amount of the warm water infusion.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then apply that care using basilicon ointment to the wounds, and all other remedies as necessary; until they are healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	§ Regarding the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs affecting the eyes, from internal head conditions.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When someone experiences acute, severe, and persistent catarrh, you will observe their eyes to be weakened, hazy, and appearing exhausted; the eyelids are ulcerated, hair falls out of them, and there is a sharp, painful, deep ache in the head, followed by sneezing. In such cases, take from these occurrences that these materials do not appear from the nose unless from many sources.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you should advise the sick person to scrub their face.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision in that groove located in the middle of the forehead or slightly broader across its width, and start from the time on the left to the right temple; and continue the incision until it reaches the bone; and stretch your hand away from the temporalis muscles, which move during mastication, until the incision is complete; and absorb all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate it between the two lips of the fissure with a hot iron or with linen lint.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then fasten it from above with strings; and moisten the strings with wine and oil so that there is no risk of a hot ulcer.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it and see that the hot ulcer is already approaching; then you should bite your lip until flesh begins to grow back in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of it with a regimens of excision that promotes the growth of flesh; such as if you take two parts from flour of wheat and four parts from colophony, and prepare a paste from them, and apply it to these wounds to promote the birth of flesh.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	§ On the care of what falls into the gold.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the gold belongs to one of four types: mineral stone or something similar to a rock, like iron and ore; from plants, such as chickpeas and beans; fluid substances, such as water, vinegar, and others similar to them; or some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore something that resembles a stone or a kind of stone that does not combine with gold nor grows in it falls into the gold, expose the gold to the sun alone; if you then see the stone, some oil or resin from it will distil into the gold.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then he should administer the extraction of it and make a sneeze when you are ready, and press the nostrils with your fingers upon the onset of sneezing, after you place a piece of cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear towards the upper parts.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Indeed, this treatment is often effective.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	However, if it does not emerge, then administer the extraction with a gest (i.e., a subtle pizigarol): its form is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it emerges with the gest, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction with a subtle, slightly curved hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not emerge through that (method), then make a tube from metal and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole deeply, and press the matter around the tube with softened cerumen mixed with oil, so that there is no passage for air except through the tube; then extract it with your strong drawing force.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Indeed, it often emerges with what we described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	However, if it does not emerge in that way: then take from helcalimbs or from viscose (i.e., prepared glue), with which birds are caught, a small amount; and place it on the end of a radius after you have wrapped it neatly with a cloth: then insert it into the ear hole easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If it does not exit with all that we have mentioned, then proceed to cut it before a hot apoplexy or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	The method of the incision is as follows: for an weak vein, especially in the head, the phlebotomist should draw blood according to the strength of the vein.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then place the infirm part between your hands, turn its ear towards the upper part, and find a small incision at the base of the ear, near its fat, in a depressed area. The incision should be in the shape of a crescent until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever tools are available to you.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then use your finger to make that incision with speed and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the object that fell into the ear is one of those small grains that grow and inflate, then perform its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey you for its exit, then take a thin, delicate spatula with this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And use it to make an incision of that kind from the falling grains in the ear, and do not think that the grain is already moistened by the ear's vapor until you apply many strikes with the frusta, then remove it with hooks or with a delicate gesture or by suction, as we said, for its extraction to be alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	When water is introduced into the ear, the patient must use a sneeze to expel it when it has been warmed and softened at first; and then he should lie down over that part of the ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it exits through that [way], then it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if it does not [exit], then take many small stones, as thin and light as a finger, warm them with fire for a little while, and let the patient insert one of them into his ear opening; and pull out one from that part on his foot, striking with another stone the one inside his ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	He should therefore continue doing this with stones until all the water has exited.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And the water will exit so that you can take one part from the fire or from a wick and insert its tip into the ear; and light the other tip with fire until it burns most of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then he should repeat the process with another wick, doing this many times until all the water has exited; and then remove it with a tube as mentioned before using the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	When removing the animal that has entered it, if it is a small body, like a flea or something similar, treat it with care as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if the body is large and appears to the senses, then perform its extraction with a gesture and hooks; and it will be easier than all that is held in the hand.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	However, when dealing with the extraction of a bone inserted into the ear, since you address it as you did in the division and treatment of distillation, and your care does not bring about improvement, then you should look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If something appears there among the nerves, then extract it with a gesture or with delicate hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there among the nerves, then take a tube whose form is narrow below and wide above, and insert its fine end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; then suck with it using strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do that many times until all the nerves emerge.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If, however, they do not obey you for the exit, then press the area around the tube with wax, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not emerge with what I said, then perform the distillations that the ancients have already been skilled in for the extraction of nerves, and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your discharge be like pouring oil and medicine into the ear with this instrument, the form of which is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you can see, make it like this from silver or brass, tightly wound below, with a small opening above and a larger one below.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	It should therefore be made so that it can drive what is in the cavity of the tube, and it must be carefully made of brass.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a radium (or similar) instrument and insert its heated tip into the ear with careful insertion; then pour oil or succus or any of these medicines into the tube, and it should be in the ear. Then introduce the radium with the tip up and compress it gently with your hand until the oil is forced into the cavity of the ear, and it feels relieved inside. The substance inserted into the ear should already be slightly warmed with fire; beware that nothing cold distills into it, for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	**On the care of the surgical wound in the ear.**
Caput VII.	**Chapter VII.**
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mother's wombs unpierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has also happened to some people that the wound in the ear is born with them from a cut or flesh in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this operation is sometimes performed in a deep hole in the ear, which does not follow the usual course; and sometimes it occurs on the outer part of the opening of the ear, and follows that course.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, what happens in the deep ear, and which does not fit the usual course of healing, is difficult to heal in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in those that follow the usual course of healing, it is necessary to place a warm compress over the ear and examine it; then, if you see an opening appearing, open it with a fine instrument whose shape follows this (the description), so that its end has some slight width and one of its sides is sharp, while the rest of the instrument has two soft edges, in order not to harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the operation is caused by tissue grown within the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it away easily until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the operation is in the deep ear, then take a thin, soft radium and heat it slightly with fire; thereafter, insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	Therefore, if you feel the operation with that which the patient presents with regarding hearing impairment, try to open it easily; however, be careful not to injure the ear's nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Next, place a quantity of balm in the wound according to its size, which you have prepared in the Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are free from the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take the balm, and mix it with rosewater, sprinkle it over the wound with powdered zinc, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the wound has already healed: then it is necessary to remove the balm and allow it with another balm that you apply in the bandage made with rose oil, until the heat of the healing subsides: then treat it until it is completely cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, bleeding occurs: then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the wound: and use the remaining treatment, which stops the predicted blood flow as described in the distillation process.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	**On the care of the eyelids.**
Caput VIII.	**Chapter VIII.**
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the conditions that occur in the eyelids of the eye when they are sometimes humid and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, it is necessary to hold them with tweezers or a hook, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Next, place a third layer of cloth over the wound.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	However, if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a delicate lens-shaped hot iron.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterizing them is better after an incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Indeed, they often return when there is something left of their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn up, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	**On the care of the eyelids of the eye.**
Caput IX.	**Head IX.**
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often, something happens to the eyelids that resembles a grain (or stone) in its strength and hardness, and for that reason it is called "grandin": and it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation on them is therefore to consider at that time, if a grandin (or stone) is proceeding from it, which appears from the eyelid, and moves to every part, then its condition is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, find the gap (fissure) above it through its width (latitude).
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then, scrape it gently from all sides until it is smooth.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then, hang it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	However, if you do not prepare to cut it, except after you have penetrated the eyelid with a slight cut, then it will cause harm to that weak part in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the gap (fissure) is large: then join it with stitches and take care of it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, it will not cause you any harm from that.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	Blood will indeed restore it and make it flesh again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if it declines greatly towards the inner part of the ear away from the surface, then turn the eyelid inside out and hang the lump with a hook; besides needing a cut, press it gently from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is elongated with a cut, it will not harm that part in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after making an incision with a saline water solution, and dress it with something that promotes healing until the patient recovers.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	**On the care of eye sockets.**
Caput X.	**Chapter X.**
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The lacrimal gland is a substance produced in the upper eyelid's tunic; indeed, it most commonly occurs in children, causing their eyes to water, and they suffer from cataracts in the morning, preventing them from seeing sunlight, due to tears flowing towards them, and you can see them always resting their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are under the eyebrows humid, which has already been affected by swelling. The prominent appearance of the lacrimal gland is evident to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the gland between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	**And the method of its operation is that it places the patient's head in your lap.**
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare it with a solution, and make a circle from it according to the quantity that contains the lacrimal gland from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over the gland and press from all sides with your fingers to collect the lacrimal gland in the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then he finds in the middle of that moisture, when the spatula is inserted, cracks that extend across the width, and there is no greater crack than that made in phlebotomy in deep tissues.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	He must then find the whole skin, until he reaches the axilla, for Axilla proceeds from the crack according to the shape of the white, fatty edge.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore, extract it with the cloth that you have inserted between your fingers towards the exterior, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add to the crack so as not to reach the eye with the spatula and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If, however, the axilla does not appear to you at the beginning of the crack, add a little to the crack with ease until the axilla proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and tighten them with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people who rub salt on them and put it into the depth of the crack so that what remains of that moisture becomes liquid.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, a fever occurs at the site of an ulcer, treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the ways to restore vision, that is, when the eyelid becomes softened towards the eye, resulting in it not closing properly as it should.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond their natural course under the skin, and they become old: then they harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as frequent tears, eyelid softening, and whiteness, until it leads to the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, the restoration of the eye is done according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or through cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what has been mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or the restoration of the eye is done through incision and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through tubes, as I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then, with your left hand, turn the eyelids of the eye.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it turns, then that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if it does not turn: insert the needle into the fold where the lash of the lower part of the eyelid is located, and make it penetrate upwards with the thread, and place it near the hair itself, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: then pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with the radius.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then, find the inner part of the eyelid beneath the added hairs with a spatula that cuts from the larger tear gland to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth beneath the eyelid; then mark the eyelid with wax in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it must be made in a shape according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid, since that varies in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From these, there are some who require that the eyelid be cut away in great quantity, according to the amount that becomes soft from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, with the scalpel, find the two lines which you have marked, and begin from the larger tear to the smaller one, and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape the entire area.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then sew together the two edges with a needle and fine thread, and blot the blood, and cause what is left of the hair to adhere above the two eyebrows, where some things may be sticking out, if you want to do that; and if not, take no concern.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and thread until three or four days; after that, take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you want to leave the wound unsutured, take care of it so that it dries and shrinks.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is lifted at the sealing of the wound and its healing; but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	These methods of care were taught by the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern about the weak, and it comes from good work, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And there is another method in ataxmia: it is such that signs on the eyelids form a figure like a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then, separate or join the three eyelids according to this form, and then cut away the excess with small scissors in accordance with this shape, with equal cuts.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If, however, it is not possible for you to hold the hook or if it does not match, then take a sharp instrument with which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure, and insert another thread near the larger tear, and the second thread near the smaller tear, and join the threads between your fingers equally.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then, position your hand with an equal elevation, and raise the skin above which the mark is located, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then, join the two wounds of the lip with stitches, and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, indeed, an abscess occurs near your cut or crack, apply it with a poultice and similar treatments from healing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids also turn, as if their hair is turning.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you must use what we have said about incisions, but the stitching of both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the care of the eye with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is done, as you turn the eyelids and split the gap within, according to what I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two tubes, or two thin sticks: their length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of the gap; and you have already made incisions at both ends on either side where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then join both with care over the excess from the eyelid, and tighten the two tubes on either side with a strong tie, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin will tighten and wither, and rot, until it falls away of itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it delays, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has hardened, raise the eyelid; and do not pull the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two tubes, which you make according to this figure, and the quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of the piercing pilons in the eye with a hook.
Caput XII.	Head XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation is as follows: take a fine, sharp hook and insert it into the eye with a thin silk thread, gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather its ends together, and tie each with a very fine knot; the length of the threads should be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then take another fine thread and compose it beneath the first in a small loop, and tie the ends of it if you see fit.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the patient should lay their head in your lap, close to the light, so that the operation may be seen, for it is a delicate one.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the hook with the thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate quickly until you extract it above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up to above the thread and insert that hair into the thread; if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out completely from the root in the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	However, if the hair does not come out with it, draw the ingrown hair towards the bottom, using the thread that you have woven into it, until the ingrown hair comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with your eye; then draw the ingrown hair and the thread, and extract both of them, and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair attaches to its place and grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate a longer hair with it from the natural hairs, and it will be pulled out with it; or leave it alone until it grows out, and then pull it out.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	**On the care of the Alxatration that occurs on the upper eyelid.**
Caput XIII.	**Chapter XIII.**
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatration (or ingrown hair) happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatration is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, accidental Alxatration occurs from the healing of a wound, or its cutting, or cauterization, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in this is that you find that consolidation, and separate its lips, and place in it what is between them, a linen thread, and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary to use in its treatment things that drain and contract, for if you do that, it will return to Al-Qabisi's condition worse than before; on the contrary, use things that soften, such as chamomile; apply it with water in which cooked althae seed has been steeped; and anoint it with a liquid made from any oil. And wrap the linen thread in it and treat it accordingly.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you preserve every intelligence so that it does not harden according to its original form.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation that we have described is nothing but a certain correction of Al-Qabisi, so that the shape of the place does not return to what it was at all.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	§ Regarding the treatment of Al-Qabisi for the lower eyelid, which is either a bulge or contraction upwards towards the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This treatment that Al-Qabisi does below is what is truly called Al-Qabisi.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And accidental is made from a wound, or fracture, or burn, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation is that you take a pair of scissors, where there is a double thread, and you insert it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear to the right tear, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh towards the upper parts with a knife, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If it thus returns to the form of the eyelid as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a radius and put it into the fissure, and convert the eyelid with it; and find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle; until when they are joined, this figure is restored, and it is a Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh as much as the side of it is acute below, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separate parts; use that with a woolen thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then he should care for them with the soothing medicines and bandages that we mentioned, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an injury to the eyelid occurs from a cut, stitch, or cauterization, then it is necessary to find the wound's plane beneath the eyelashes, even as it was before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, as we mentioned.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And in summary, regarding the care of an eyelid, whether it is above or below, the operation should proceed as prepared according to the form of Albucasis.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	Indeed, it (the eyelid) presents many differences in form: and a prudent artisan prepares the skill to adapt to any way possible, until he returns the shape to its natural or nearly natural form, and himself, as the patient, according to what is appropriate for him from the operation and tools in numerous arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	§ On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Head XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	This adhesion occurs in many people, such that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the whiteness of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the tip of the radius under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp like the spatumils, but rather obtuse slightly; so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and remove the spatula without causing any harm to the eye with its sharpness, and make your incision as if you were easily scraping away that adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion is healed entirely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then apply to the eye a mixture of salt water, washing it with water; or distil it directly into the eye using a sieve made from a soft fabric soaked in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid and the eye using a clean linen thread; place a cloth soaked in alum on top of the eye, and use a sieve and solid bandages after three days, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	§ On the cutting of the fingernail and the prominent part of the meat of the tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the fingernail is of two kinds.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	It is either nervy or similar to hard, thin bone.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	It is not a nerve, but similar to frozen white humidity: when it comes into contact with hot iron or tries to grasp it with a hook, it separates and the hook does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And neither of these conditions begins unless it is preceded by a greater tear, which gradually increases until it obstructs vision and blocks light and eye movement.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation for this cut is to place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open the patient's eyes and lift their eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take a hook with a slightly curved claw and extend it towards the upper part.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert a hair from a horse's bristle, or a downy feather, into it: and let the thread be strong, and make both ends of the needle slightly curved, and fix it in the middle of the claw; then pierce the skin with the needle and tie the thread to the claw, and extend it towards the upper part. And scrape the side of the claw that follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with the hair until its very end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then make a cut in the remaining part at the base of the tear gland with a delicate scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear gland intact so that it does not cause continuous tearing after the cut.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail extends with a single hook; or with a thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it will be scraped with a soft spatula, which has this form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful, let the spatula not touch the corneal tunic, and it should not cause a tear in it, or the pupil will be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the cut, put something salty crushed into the eye, or from a mixture of herbs, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it as necessary until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not bony, and you cannot insert a hook into it, nor does it have a hook on it, then this type of nail often heals with medicine, and is cured as described in division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you need to cut it, then open the eye with a soft spatula, thin, weak in sharpness, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from above with care and precision.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it thins and breaks, and the cut is made, then from this moment on, pour into the eye some of the mixture prepared from herbs, or red ochre, or finely ground salt; and bandage the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation over the same area until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is no sign of heat in the affected eye, then let it be and treat the ulcer until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with reason until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the bulge of flesh over the eye causes great injury, it should be suspended with a hook and cut from that part, but not the final cut, so as not to disrupt the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then stop the tear flow if it is red or caused by inflammation, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	§ From the incisions of Alguarden (and the flesh grown in the eye).
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in certain human eyes, red flesh grows or is superimposed until it covers the pupil, or approaches or tightens around the eyelids, and perhaps even turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose bud.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also such that it places the weak head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then he opens her eyes and collects all that flesh with hooks attached to it; and holds it with one forceps or by gesture.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then he cuts the flesh in the first place until it is completely finished with an incision.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And he makes a hole from the eye, so as not to damage it during the operation; and let your cut be where you are cutting it, or with a spatula, which we mentioned in the chapter on nail incisions, or with small forceps, with which the wound is collected, according to its shape after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete and all the blood has been drained, then fill the eye with crushed salt or sprinkle it with red powder and other astringent medicines; and place a hot compress with white clay on top of the eye to protect it from further damage by heat.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there remains any blood after the draining and you feel a hot surge, and fear a hot apoplessia, then release the eye and care for it with what soothes the apoplessia.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then he repeats the procedure on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And likewise, do with the added flesh that occurs in the eye from this same kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that with every weak eye, cure should be sought either from the natural way or from an accidental way, by operating with a tool; and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you understand that that member can endure that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	§ On the removal of a sebum from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	**Head XVIII.**
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebum is red veins that are situated over the eye and prevent the eye from performing its function; it weakens the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, you must first consider if the eye with sebum in it is strong and free from any illness other than the sebum, then remove the sebum from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is advisable for the weak one to place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with a hook or two, according to your discretion; the hook should be thin and folded twice, in this form, or there could be two hooks placed in one body, in this way.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then remove them carefully with fine forceps and wipe away the blood every hour until you see the veins moving out of the eye and they are resolved; be careful not to hurt the eye with the ends of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation very much: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then it will drip into the eye either with a green or red color: so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the grease.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	However, if it is not possible for you to collect all of that at that time, then apply a plaster to the eye with something that soothes the pain of the eye and leave it for several days until the pain subsides; then protect it from further heat and afterward repeat over it in the same manner until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	§ On the reduction of Arissati (a medical instrument) to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctors call the Arissati forceps, which they use for incisions with cautery or sharp medicine, as described in the preceding account.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it; except to find the aperture next to its origin and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	If, therefore, the bone is detected and you see corruption or blackening in it, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is as follows.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the "Asperi capitis," or the scalpel.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made from steel, and let its head be round like an azir (a type of ancient coin), with a fine point formed by either the edge of a chisel or a sharp aliskilfer (an old tool). Place this over the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then hold it between your fingers and gently press with your hand until you know that corruption is no longer present, and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the area with cauterizing medicinal poultices.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If, therefore, the area is consolidated and flesh grows, and the flow of pus stops, and it does not fester or worsen, and no other incident occurs for forty days, then know that it is already healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if this does not happen, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nasal opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is as if you remove the bone with a steel instrument or a sharp medicine: and when the bone is detected, then take this drill according to this form, let its end be triangular, and the wood of it be a tapered pyramid up to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on top of the eye itself: and let it be near the tear; and stretch your hand away from the eye slightly.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then you should bend your hand with the knife, until it penetrates the bone and you feel the weakness of it; through which it finds power to exit from that place when it holds its own hand over its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, at that time, restore the place with astringent medicines as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When the flesh is formed and the place hardens, then the matter that was exuded to the outside returns to the nose; it becomes lighter over the weak part.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	## On the Reduction of Eye Protrusion
Caput XX.	**Chapter XX.**
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entire force, and no injury occurs to sight, nor any diminution; then you should relieve the weak part; then use phlebotomes on it; afterwards place blood-letting cups on the cheek without scarring, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye a liniment made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarkocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then, tighten the eye above the plaster with many little threads.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the manner of the threads is as follows: take many soft cloths, and double each cloth four times; make many from them, then place one upon another according to the need of the eye, and finally tighten them with a strong hard cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the process with suction without scarring.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the suction and leave the eye tightened day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	However, if the ligament softens again, it should be tightened much more; then, after a day and night, remove the ligament as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see that the eye has regained its new skin, it is good; and if not, repeat the plaster, threads, tightening, and suction until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	# On the Incision of the Skin's Layer
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When there is a rupture in the skin's layer, it protrudes and extends beyond the eyelids like a grain, causing disfigurement to the face due to that, and one should cut it; then the operation on it is as I describe: it is necessary to insert a sharp instrument into the root of the eyelid from below upwards.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle through which a double thread is passed from the tearful side, and cause it to penetrate. And leave the first needle according to its arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place where the double thread is located, and tie with it the edge of the skin around the needle: and tighten it greatly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the needle, and place on it a woolen thread soaked in alum: and leave it until the thread falls off with the skin.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the eye with it, so that it is healed until the wound is cured.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the skin is tightened from all sides in a circular shape with cloth, until the eye gains great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a fine spatula that reaches the depth of the eye, and the moisture of the alum runs down, and the eye falls out and enters immediately: then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	**Of the cure of alum.**
Caput XXII.	**Head XXII.**
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This affliction called alum is not, but a health that is gathered in the eye, similar to water running down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation is such that you make the invalid sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head in both of your hands and move it until you feel that the blood has reached the lower part of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is fixed so that it does not fall, and the light is restored; and the invalid sees things as he used to see them: and if it does not descend below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	However, if the descent of the blood is not prepared as we said, then make the invalid sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin spatula and find it above the corny membrane slightly near the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the crown, until the blood flows out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When the blood has flowed out, then drop into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fennel and honey: then it is treated with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	§ On the care of water that flows into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have previously discussed the types of water in division, and those that are suitable for perforation according to the statement and explanation of the topic, then take it the same way according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Therefore, you must make the patient sit with their infirm eye squared between your hands, opposite to the light, towards the sun, and bind its healthy eye, holding it tightly. Then, with your right hand, if the eye with water is the left one, press the right eye, or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand with the almug (instrument), if the eye is on the left, or your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the instrument near the edge of the cornea, according to its thickness, on the white part of the eye that is visible, where the smallest tear duct is located; then push the instrument with strength, and you turn it with your hand until it penetrates into the cornea, and you will feel that the instrument has reached the hollow space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it must be that the depth of the instrument's journey is measured according to the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the cornea of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will indeed see that in the very pupil of the eye, due to the clarity of the cornea's tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almagest until the place where water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the same downward, one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person will see it above which he opens his wound immediately, and the almagest in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then deposit it a second time, besides what the almagest emerges.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almagest easily: and you return your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt of the gemstone: and wash with it the inside of the eye.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place over the eye the whole poultice, or cloth soaked in rose oil and alum: and bind it with a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those of our time, place on it ground cinnamon crushed with alum.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the surgeon does not obey you and enters the eye due to its hardness, since it is an eye of a human being, whose eye is very hard, then you should take a small instrument called an Alberid, which has this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, when performing this operation, only join the specific junction and do not insert your entire hand into the opening; it is only necessary to create a narrow space for the surgeon's instrument.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the surgeon's instrument, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And for the completion of your work, prepare a comfortable sleeping place for the patient in a dark room, where he sleeps on his back; and forbid all movements and coughing; and give him that food which soothes his nature; and do not allow him to move his head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And the bandage should be left according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then remove it in that dark room and examine his sight; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary for him to do that during the time of healing or immediately after the incision; on the contrary, he should leave it for someone else, because water rises quickly through the fresh wound.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, a hot aphtha occurs: then it is necessary to wash the eye before the seventh day; and straighten it with what calms the aphtha until it is calm, then remove the bandage, and place over its face an oral agent to regulate its vision for several days while it remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then it should gradually leave the house and return to its case.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in zeal the student is not excused from seeing several times; then indeed he dares to engage in surgery.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed, some of those from Al-Andalus have now reached us, who said that a certain procedure was done in Al-Andalus, through which water is drawn out.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Therefore, no one has ever been seen in our land to have done that; nor is it written about in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from the magus, so that he may stand on them who is ignorant of them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	They should be made of proper air; and their ends should be triangular with the same subtlety, and the tip acute.
Formae magda.	Forms of the magus.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of flesh grown in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	**Chapter XXIV**
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes various types of flesh grow in the nose, some resembling a scorpion with many feet, from which comes cancerous, pebble-like flesh, of a dark color; and from it comes soft flesh, not dark colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, regarding the soft flesh which is neither frail nor cancerous, you should place it between your hands and open the nostrils, then insert an hook into that flesh; afterwards, pull it out towards the exterior and cut what you have grasped with a thin, sharp, curved blade, until you know that all the flesh has been entirely removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains from that which cannot be cut away, then cut it with a thin tool easily until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood predominates or a hot ulcer occurs, then oppose it with what is necessary; or if it is from malignant ulcers, then apply cauterization until the blood stops and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Afterward, throw vinegar or water into the nose after the cut has been made.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened and moisture flows from it until it reaches the palate, then know that it is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that there is a carnal growth within the upper bones of the nose to which the instrument did not reach with the cut.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then you should introduce a line of thread with some thickness and knots in it; and put between each knot the size of a finger, or less: then make the sick person pass one end of the thread into the nose with a hook, or whatever possible after he has made it similar to a cat's claw; and draw out its smell until it reaches the cavity, and comes out above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed, many children do this like atoms in schools; and it is an easy thing for whoever wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place both ends of the thread: one end that emerges above the nose, and the other end remaining inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then, using the assistance of the knots in the thread, apply pressure to the flesh where they are located.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is now pressed against the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread and place it in the nose after the blood has stopped flowing, which you have absorbed into the Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more, until the ointment has completely dissolved what remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then, after some days, insert a lead pipe into the nose until the condition improves.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If, however, further treatment is required to drain it, use it.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making the head purgative, through which oils and other medicines flow into the nose, make it of silver or brass; it should be similar to a small lamp, open like a conch shell, and its passageway likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you make the pipe closed like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the instrument's conch shell for the head purgative should be full and open: it should have a handle at the end, with which you can hold it when you heat oil in it, or anything else that you want to express or make flowable.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	**On the care of the nose.**
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times it is born at the end of the nose, and it becomes magnificent and increases with days until a final shape is formed.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that, it is necessary to remove it from the beginning of its appearance and uproot all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the site, or a caustic application, or a burning medicine that takes its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If the incision is delayed until it becomes magnificent, then consider if it is hard, firm, of a dark colour, and has few sensations; then do not touch it with iron, because it is a malignant ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many times it is seen that those who have an ulceration also suffer from great evil because of it;
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the ulcer is soft to the touch, not dark coloured, and you see that an incision can be made throughout all of it, then encourage the weak and make the incision without fear, without hesitation; and treat the site with what draws out and constricts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	§ On the stitching of the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when there is a rupture of the continuity of one of these cartilage structures, the operation confers little benefit to it, except in certain cases.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something happens to anyone of them, you should consider whether there is a recent wound with its own blood; then gather the two parts of the wounded area together and sew them up; afterwards, take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the continuity of the lips has already been separated and one part is healthy, then you should cauterize all parts that are detached from their skin until they bleed.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather the two lips together with sutures and tighten them, and apply a dragon's blood poultice on top, and crushed olibanum; place a fragment of a clean plaster over it, and use another consolidating plaster; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads come out on their own.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with an ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of stitching is to gather the continuity of the wound, or with a pad, as we have described for the stitches on the abdomen; or to gather the wound together with threads, as you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of lip nodules.
Caput XXVII.	**Chapter XXVII**
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people suffer from hard protrusions inside their lips, often resembling small or large grains of herb, and some have both kinds.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip and find each node, and hang it with a hook, and cut it off from every part.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then, after the cut, apply pressure with a clean cloth until the bleeding stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place treated with it where there is stiffness, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the cut of flesh grown over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	**Chapter XXVIII**
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Flesh often grows over the gums, which the ancients called abscesses.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, it is necessary to hang it with a hook or hold it with pincers and cut it near its root, allowing the pus or blood to flow out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place over the wound a third covering, or other suitable, absorptive dressings.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If the flesh returns to its original state after treatment, as it often does, then cut it away a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	§ On the use of iron in tooth extraction.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	They (teeth) sometimes adhere to the surfaces from both the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, becoming rough, painful, and sometimes yellowish and green, until they are finally destroyed by the gum and become foul-smelling teeth.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should make the infirm (tooth) sit between your hands and its head in your armpit, and rub it with a stone or tooth, where you can see the rough parts, just like sand; until nothing of that remains, and do likewise for blackness, whiteness, yellowness, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If what is in them from the beginning of their condition can be removed, that is good; and if not, then repeat the treatment on them another day, second, third, until you reach the end of your study regarding what you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that the tooth requires various forms of razors, many shapes, according to what is prepared for your operation; because the razor that cuts through the tooth from below is different from the razor that cuts between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors should be prepared for you as you see them.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	§ On the Extraction of Teeth Pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You must cure the tooth from its pain with all diligence, and do not delay in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For indeed, its pain does not subside when it is extracted, as it is a noble substance; however, until there is no excuse for avoiding the extraction, then when the patient is compelled to extract it, it should be done firmly and certified by you as the painful tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many times the patient is deceived by pain, and thinks that it is gone from the tooth and extracts it; then the pain does not retreat until the sick tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen that from the work of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the aching tooth is certified to be sound by you, then it is necessary that you make incisions around the tooth with a scalpel, in which there should be something of virtue, until the gum is solved from every part; then move it yourself with your fingers, or gradually with fine forceps at first, until it comes loose.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then take a large forceps with good grip and place it on the tooth's head between your legs; hold it firmly so that it does not move. Then pull the tooth straight, without breaking it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and insert them under it from every side with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If, however, the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary to fill that hole with cloth and tie it with a fine ray's end so that it does not break during your squeezing on top of it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you be very careful with the incision around the gum from every side a lot.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so that you do not break it, and let a part of it remain, and return to the sick from that malice which causes the most pain in the first place.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, do not do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and arrogance regarding its removal, except that they administer what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many times they cause great infirmities in men that are hard to break, and all the roots of such remain, or some of them, or so as to extract it with certain bones of the mandible, as we have often witnessed.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	It is then bound after its eradication with wine, or vinegar, and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If there is a flow of blood from the wounds (which often happens), then press something onto it and fill the area with it; otherwise, cauterize them if they do not stop bleeding.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The pliers should have long handles, a short grip, and be made of thick iron or good-quality steel; their ends should not overlap when pressed against a tooth, but rather be straight as you can see here. They should have narrow tips that enter into certain teeth and hold them fast with strong pressure.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the ends take on the shape of the bird's beak, which is called a crowbar, they become strong tools for gripping.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	**On the Eradication of Teeth and the Extraction of Mandibular Bones**
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains, at the removal of a tooth that breaks something, then it is necessary to place over the site a custom poultice with butter for one or two days, until the site softens; then insert the forceps or pliers, whose ends conform to the shape of the beak called the ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of these forceps is as follows:
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The ends of these are made like a sawtooth or like a chisel.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, therefore, it does not yield to you when using these forceps, then you must apply leverage over the root and remove all the tissue, and insert an instrument called a small lever, which has this form.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	It has a short but thick end; it should not be soaked to avoid breaking.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If, therefore, the root comes out through that, it is good; but if not, it must be dislodged with other instruments of this shape.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first end is triangular, with some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The triangular end is delicate.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also cut with this instrument having two branches, which has this form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that preceded it in terms of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also a cut with this instrument that resembles a large hook, with curved ends and a certain thickness to prevent breaking, and it should not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you should know that there are many instruments for teeth, and similarly, other tools are not counted; a skilled artisan, subtle in his art, found this instrument himself, according to which he names the operation and the illness itself.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because they come from illnesses to which the ancient instruments did not refer, due to the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	However, if a bone breaks from the jaw or any other bone of the mouth, or decays; then examine it at its place with what is appropriate for it from the instruments and pincers I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and cut with gestures, whose form is as follows.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	It should have some thickness gradually applied to it, so that it tightens or holds the bone, and does not escape or gush out, until the bone is extracted; then restore the place with appropriate medicines for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is a small putrefied part in a bone, then cut it away from its putridity and treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the prominent teeth surpassing others.
Caput XXXII.	Head XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural growth, an unsightly form results from it: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is, the vulgar (common) ones.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary that you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth grows after another, and is not mobile or its root is impossible to extract, then it should be cut out; and if it is attached to another tooth, then it should be cut with this instrument, whose form is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It has a similar appearance to a small face, and is made of iron, with very acute ends.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And your incision should be how you cut it over many days, and because of the tooth's hardness, and so that no other tooth moves.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	However, if it is prominent and exposed, its cutting edge should be filed with this file made of iron, whose form is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Sit entirely from the indus, and its handle of minute punctures of various sizes, like a limas with which needles are made; with it the tooth is smoothed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth does not move and falls out; then make it soft, finally smooth it with certain rasors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If there is a tooth from which a part breaks off and injures the tongue, then it is necessary to smooth it with a limas until the roughness of that fracture is removed and it becomes even; and apply it, so as not to injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	§ On the relationship of teeth with golden threads.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer a shock or displacement from impact or accident and the weak patient cannot hold them firmly enough to prevent loss, and treatment with astringent medicines has not been effective, then the cure lies in binding them with golden threads; for silver turns green and decays over time, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And the thread should be of intermediate thickness according to the amount that it can hold between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the method of the arrangement is as follows: take the thread and insert its double length between two healthy teeth; then weave it with both ends of the thread between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the mesh all the way to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture until you reach the part from which you began, and hold your hand firmly but gently, until it is not moved at all, and let your compression be where you tighten the thread, near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors; gather them together and twist them with your fingers; insert them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth, so as not to harm the tongue; then release it so that the knot remains tight.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	However, if it becomes loose or cut, tighten them with another thread and secure it in that way for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the arrangement of the two healthy teeth, and the two moving teeth, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it happens that a tooth or two return to their original place after the fall, and are retained as we have described, then this can only be done by an artist, prudent and skilled.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when some suitable bone is obtained from a fresh wound, it is shaped like a tooth and placed in the position where the tooth is missing and held in place, as we have said; then it remains and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	§ Regarding the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this condition that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open the lower jaw at its base in your hand, and raise his tongue; then cut through that nervous ligament across its width until the tongue is freed from its attachment.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something of hardness and knotting in it, resulting from the healing of a wound, then throw an hook into it and find its width, until you cut through the ligament and release the knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful, so that there is no fracture in the deep flesh, and cut through the artery there, and let not blood flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it is washed at the site of the cut with pink water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a piece of linen that holds it open at night so that it does not harden again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If, however, bleeding occurs, then apply a crushed sponge over the site.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If indeed the blood seeps, then cauterize the site with a hot iron, which is appropriate for it; then tend to it as you would tend to the rest, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of the membrane (ranula) beneath the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Head XXXIV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes a depression occurs beneath the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural movements; and it may become so swollen that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the treatment for this is to open the lower jaw before the sun and consider the depression.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see that it has a dull colour, either black or dark, and there is no feeling of pain in it; then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it becomes depressed and white, in which there is moisture, then throw a hook at it and cut it away with a thin blade, freeing it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If indeed the blood seeps during your treatment, then place a crushed crust over it and wait until the blood stops; then resume your treatment until you have completely extracted it.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is wrapped with vinegar and salt, and the treatment itself remains as part of the cure until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	§ On the cure of an apsema (ulcer) between two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Head XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat (i.e., the glands) resembling small cotton balls, which occur outside, and these are called two tonsils (amygdales), which, when treated as we said in division, and do not heal, then consider them.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore the apsema is of a dark colour, has little sensation, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red colour, and its root is thick, then do not touch it with iron even, fearing blood flow, rather leave it until it heals naturally.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either pierce it yourself, or it will break open of itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white colour, round, and its root is thin, then you should cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is such that you consider before your operation, if the apsema's heat is calm and complete, or diminishes in any way, then therefore make the patient sit facing the sun, and his head in your lap, and open his mouth, and with a slave holding him, press his tongue below with the instrument, which has this form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Make it from silver or brass, so that it is as thin as a blade.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	So, when you have positioned it with the tongue and the fistula is visible to you and your finger drops onto it, then take a hook and fix it into the fistula, and extract it as far as possible, except for something of the cloth remaining on it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the instrument, whose form this follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is shaped like a fork; however, its ends should be protected so that the opening of each is sharp and direct, from which it is necessary to take care that it is made of iron or otherwise coated.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spoon, whose form this follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one fistula, cut the other according to this same form of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after cutting, the patient should rinse with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is a flow of blood, gargle with water in which the cortex of granate has been boiled, or myrtle leaves and similar astringents, until the flow of blood stops; then care for the wound until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other spots appear in the throat, apart from the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut them according to what I said about the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed I have already treated a woman from whose throat a growth had emerged, which turned dark, with little sensation, almost closing her throat; and she was breathing heavily through a narrow opening, and I had forbidden her food and water, and she had already reached the edge of death, if she had not been saved within one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the growth would only protrude enough to extend beyond the two nasal openings until it emerged from them.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore acted more urgently, and fixed a hook into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large part came out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where it was caught in the nasal opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did that which proceeds from the second nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue; then I fixed a hook into that very aperture. Afterwards, I removed a part of it, and from that place nothing but a little blood came out; thus the woman's throat was healed, and she began to drink water immediately, and afterwards she took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not stop making incisions from that opening for a very long time; and an aperture succeeded the place where I made the incision, until it became too prolonged and when that happened to her.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I then devised and cauterized the aperture between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	She stopped from adding more; then I moved from that place, and I did not know what God had done to her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	## On the Incision of the Uveal Apperture
Caput XXXVII.	HEAD XXXVII
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the mucus descends to the uvula and becomes prolonged, and an aperture is formed (in it), then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called uvula.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When treatment is accomplished with that which we have mentioned in division, and the cure does not progress, you will see that the abscess has grown hot and is soft; then it is necessary to incise it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And if a round lump has formed from it, which does not extend in length, and is of a blood-red, brownish, or black color, without sensation, then it is necessary to carefully incise it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For indeed, there is fear of complication with the wound.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I have mentioned in terms of its whiteness and length, you should position the patient before the sun, and press its tongue with the instrument whose description preceded this: then fix a hook in it and pull it downward, and incise it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the incision of the tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary not to incise from that unless the part added to the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it any more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use what we have mentioned in the incision of the tonsils, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the patient is disturbed by the incision, then it is necessary to use skill in cauterizing him without fear and anxiety.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	The method of cauterization is not otherwise effective than with sharp water: and it is as if you place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take water as I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and make a paste with it that is neither too thick nor too thin, and fill this cavity of the instrument whose form is as follows.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Place the extremity of the instrument where the medicine is to be applied, just as the cavity of the radius of a shell.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the same ulcer: and have the patient lying on his side, so that the salt from his mouth flows out due to the inherent medicine, so that nothing descends from it into his throat and hurts him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And from the first, apply it to the ulcer with a quantity that is half an hour, until you perceive that it has already become darkened and the pain of the medicine has subsided.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a poultice and cover it over the extremity of the radius, and insert the poultice with medicine inside a tube on top, until the poultice adheres to the skin.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then allow it to stay: for indeed it withers and falls off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to apply more medicine, do so; after cauterization, clean around the wound with a cloth soaked in butter, and then cleanse it with what is around it from the medicine; and wash it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it should be treated externally with bandages, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This, therefore, is the kind of cure that involves a cleaner cut and extends freedom from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the wound is cured even better than with cauterization and incision; for it is cured with smoke, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calament, hyssop, oregano, rue, parsley, chamomile, and black-eye, and similar herbs; mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and submerge with vinegar until they bubble: the pot should be sealed well with fine mud; and there should be an opening in the middle of the pot for placing the heated instrument, as described.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it from silver or brass, and insert the tip with the pomegranate into the lower mouth until the vapor rises to the top over the pipe, until the eye is much obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat this over the same area many times until it heals.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful not to perform this cure at the beginning of the onset of the apsema.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For indeed, it adds pleasure to the apsema, and you should not perform that unless at the decline of its heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If, however, you do not have this instrument, then take a pipe and attach a piece of bark to its end, so that it does not burn the lower jawbone, because the bark prevents the vapor from burning the bone, and this is from good healing with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	§ On the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Head 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often, a bone adheres in the throat, or a fish spine, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you must extract what is apparent from them, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the light, and it will be declared to you whether it is in the throat or not.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if something is not visible to you and remains hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the foreign body will exit through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or if the patient swallows a fragment of raw naphtes, or a root of lettuce, or a dry crumb of bread, or takes a piece of soft, dried sea sponge and ties it with a thread before swallowing it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it reaches the location where there are spines or bones, and they are extracted, then it exits.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not exit with what I said, then use an instrument made of lead in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	It should be slightly thicker than the radius bone, and have a sharp end that easily enters the throat; it should also keep its head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And it should be careful not to touch its epiglottis, so as not to cause coughing, and push with it a bone, or a spine, or have the doctor insert it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Indeed, it is better for the patient to insert it, because of his knowledge of the location of the foreign body, and push it downwards, or pull his hand upwards with the instrument, according to the amount that was prepared for him, until it exits.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of the phlebotom (bloodsucker)
Caput XXXIX.	**Chapter XXXIX**
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the phlebotom is treated with what I have mentioned regarding division from cure with medicines, and it does not improve, then consider the condition of its drop under the sun, or near the sun after you have placed its tongue with the instrument that I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your wound over the phlebotom has fallen, extract it with a small hook, or with careful gestures appropriately.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them: then take a hollow tube and insert it into the phlebotom's droplet as close to the droplet as possible: then insert into the hollowness of the tube a heated iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times, and have the patient abstain from water throughout the day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then take a full cup of cold water and open the patient's mouth with it: and have them drink their own saliva from it, without swallowing anything from it: then move the water every hour afterward with their hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	The phlebotom indeed falls immediately when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If, however, it does not exit with what we have described, then suffocate the patient with fumes, or with wings and an instrument, as I described for the suffocation of a fly.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, because it will fall on its own.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of suffocation is as follows: take a bowl, into which are placed burning coals and a few live coarsely cut hairs; cover the bowl with a lid that has a hole in it; and place the end of the instrument inside that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then release the suffocation and have the patient place their mouth at the end of the tube, and close their mouth so that the suffocation does not escape, until you know that the suffocation has reached the blood vessel.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	Because the blood vessel will immediately burst.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not burst, then repeat the suffocation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the patient should endure thirst, eat spicy foods, and other things, but not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary to exit with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the blood vessel is extracted from the throat when it bursts on that surface.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you can see; except that it has a curved tip that extends to the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its tip resembles the beak of a crow, which has a rough edge; when it grasps something, it does not let go entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	§ On the opening of fistulas, their cutting, and general care.
Caput XL.	Head XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of fistulas, varying according to their origin and recall, namely, one kind, and this book will describe one; they differ in their perforation and cutting in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One kind is among the species of fistulas, which itself grasps from humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The second manner is according to the places where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since the fistula happening in the head is different from the one happening in the anus; and the fistula happening in a fleshy place is different from that happening in the joints; each of them has its judgment according to its operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And there are fistulas that should not be cut unless after the purifying of the humor within them and its completion; and among these are those that should be cut while they are still raw and do not complete their purification according to the balance.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As the openings that are close to the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Since the opening, when it occurs near a joint and extends to be of greater extent until the putrefaction that surrounds it, perhaps corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, which is why it becomes the cause for the closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an opening near the main member; for if you delay its piercing until it matures, it will harm either that one or through that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near anus, so pierce the one when it is immature; and it is not necessary to pierce a crude opening, not yet completed digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extends to the internal parts of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or in its term where it is not healed.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You should know the time of piercing the opening, which has matured according to its completion; and it is near the cessation of pain, decrease of fever, and pallor, and pulse, and sharpness of the head of the opening; and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you should make the same piercing at a lower place of the opening, and of greater eminence; and the piercing should be perpendicular to the length of the body, if the openings are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of the tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that are reflected, incise with a perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When there is a true abscess in fleshy parts: then it is better to leave the perforation of it until its healing is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Since if you perforate it before that, the course of the pus is prolonged from it, and there is much irritation and adhesions, and perhaps the edges of it harden, and its depth increases.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body where it is necessary, or according to that which the member requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary to administer a small perforation in small abscesses and a large perforation in large abscesses, or many sections according to the similarity of their size.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses where it is necessary to make an incision in the skin, and when it has already formed like a cloth, and has become firm, as it often does in many cases, as in buboes and gangrenes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from them are those that are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And among them is one where it is incised as the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As for the hernia of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from them, a round cut is made, and a half-moon cut; and similar cuts are made from them.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	But for those who lack a head, as with loose, superficial hernias, it is necessary to perforate them with a single superficial piercing, or only cut them flatly.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the hernia is thick, and has already collected a great deal of blood, and you pierce it, so as not to draw out and remove all the pus at that moment: on the contrary, remove part of it from that itself.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cover the hernia until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the degree, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak of strength, or a pregnant woman, or a very young child, or an old person who has weakened; for the animal spirit often leaves the body with the discharge of blood, and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not notice.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your incision, through which you make these incisions, you must cleanse the wound, and consider it.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the aposteme is small, or it is a flat cut, then apply a poultice of linen or an ancient cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the aposteme is great, and there are many cracks from the incision, then you must insert a poultice into every crack until they heal again.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the aposteme, or made a deep groove around it, then you must fill it with an old cloth, or as when a garment is woven, or brushed linen without moisture, and tighten it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove the bandage and care for it as needed with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however there is a flow of blood during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked in them a cloth: and place it over the place where the blood flow is multiple times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If however the flow of blood persists, then you must apply a treatment, and care, and cleansers, which I have described in many places in this book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is during the winter season and the affected area involves many nerves, then you should insert small pieces of cotton soaked in wine and hot oil, and place them on top of the affected area.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is during the summer season and the affected area is fleshy, then you should place cotton pieces soaked in water, oil, or a mixture of wine and oil, and keep the entire area cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, you should then open up the abscess, clean it, and administer whatever is appropriate for its healing until it is cured.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary for the general understanding of treating abscesses.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, as I have already discussed about every abscess, how the way to its healing is described individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	**On the Abscesses Occurring on the Skin of the Head.**
Caput XLI.	Head 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur on the skin of the head and are of a type that involves bags contained within layers of skin, which resemble the sacs of a hen's eggs.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	From them come rich ones and those that hold a humidity similar to clay; and from them (come) those that hold a humidity similar to dough and pastes, and others like them, and from them are those that are hard stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in all cases, there is no fear of their extraction as long as the artery does not oppose their section.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is such that you experience it with an instrument whose form comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if there is that which contains humidity, then dry it with the section according to the length of the surface section: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line B to line G. When the humidity is exhausted, then scrape off the crust that contains that humidity, and do not leave anything completely intact from it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Indeed, it often returns if anything remains of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the bandage in Egyptian ointment if it is available; and if not, in water and salt: and apply it to the wound, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	Indeed, it corrodes what remains from a cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then it applies a poultice over it with Egyptian lint, second and third times, and if you need to do this more often, until you are confident that nothing remains from the cyst, then indeed treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If it contains a large nodule: then dry it in this manner, making a cut in the shape of a cross and pulling the hooks between the two parts of the cut, and scraping it from all sides, and using your strength to remove the garment that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	However, if it causes opposition for you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly, for an abscess, if it is hard like stone, through cutting and the same cure, as we said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the cut over a hard abscess is easier, because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain abscesses on the head of some men, where there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	This is because I followed an abscess on the head of a young woman, and I found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be crushed: and if anyone throws something at it, it hurts.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	Indeed, in other types of accidents affecting the head, except for these rashes that occur on the heads of children and near the roots of the ears, all of them should be cut through a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a puncture in them always from the lower part, so that the flow of cleanliness goes downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care of them as it suits from the cure they get.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	§ On the incision of strophules (fleshy growths) on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Head (section) 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Many times these rashes occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur elsewhere on the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And on those that occur from them on the neck, there is one and many; they are generated from each other; and every strophule of them is within its own tunic, as in the nodes and rashes of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of these strophules are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And indeed, there are some that are rocky; and some that contain humors (fluids); and others that are malignant, which do not obey cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that part, therefore, which you see to be of good disposition in the touch, and whose proximity to the skin's color is evident, and it moves towards all parts, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the guidage (tendons), nor to the artery, and it is not deep: it is necessary that you cut it with a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line, b. to the line, g., and remove the skin from all sides, and extend two folds of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks if needed, as we said in the appendages of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is especially careful not to harm any vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And do not use a sharp blade excessively; so that you do not strain your hand with the cut, or disturb the patient, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If however you cut a vein, or an artery, and it prevents you from operating, then apply a crushed cauterizing pad, or some powder that cuts off the blood, and bind the wound, and release it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound becomes softer; otherwise it will begin to putrefy and rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	Because the blood is cut off; therefore return to your operation until it is completed.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then, with your index finger, feel if any of the smaller stumps remain; then cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein in the base of a strophula, then you should not cut it from its base; instead, you must tie it with a strong doubled thread and release it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with more of the Egyptian ointment that you have already applied.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the strophula is completely incised, then you should gather the two lips of the wound and close them immediately after you see that the excess has disappeared.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	However, if you see that the excess remains due to the size of the strophula, then you should intend to incise its root and extract it; and apply the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And for those strophulas that contain moisture, make a superficial perforation in them so that you can see the place of their maturity; and put the perforation below as we have said, following the course of the body below.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after the perforation, apply a dressing with lint and ointment similar to it, in order to corrode what remains of the corruption, until you see that the wound is already cleansed; then take care of yourself with a meat-based ointment until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the division of the epiglottis following an opening within the throat by accident.
Caput XLIII.	**Chapter XLIII**
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this division of the epiglottis, and they knew of no one in our land who had performed it; and this is the record of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In cases of strangulation, it is necessary that the division of the epiglottis be made with care: if it is not done through that passage: for all the veins and the lung are below.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot apostema (ulcer) in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no pain in the channels, it is necessary to use the division of the epiglottis, to avoid the destruction that occurs from this position.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, we must make a small cut with three or four incisions across its width, in the space between the two circles, so that the section is done on the side (not through the cartilage), and this place is suitable for the section because it is enclosed by flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from there.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then he should use a hook to stretch the skin of the throat.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he finds the wound, until it reaches the canal: it should be washed with blood, if something is seen to come out of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he cuts the tissue as we described; and it is said over the section of the canal from the phlegm that comes out of it, when it breaks off and falls away.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the open wound at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the time comes when it is feared that the inflammation will become severe, two layers of skin around the wound are removed, and only the flesh itself without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then he applies medicines that cause the flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	In conclusion, as we have described, the exposure is not done unless they see that one of these ulcers has already soaked the throat of the patient; and the patient, having been elevated above death, desires to be cut open so that he may breathe through the wound in some way and be saved from death. And therefore they proceed to cut the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe through the wound in the place where it was injured, and thus is saved. And for this reason they hasten to leave the open wound until the malady consumes its evil, and the malady lasts for three days, and almost as if it were itself; then they proceed to close the wound and take care of themselves until they are healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I have seen myself is that a nurse takes up the knife and sends it into her throat, and cuts with it part of the pulmonary artery.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I have been called upon to treat it, and I found it making a sound like the moaning of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore examined the wound and found blood that had exited from the wound of the lung.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I am therefore convinced that she did not sever the vein, nor tie it off; and the flow was coming out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore prepared, and treated my own wound, until it was healed; and the nurse suffered nothing but a hoarse voice: and after several days she returned for better treatment.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	From this, therefore, I say that there is no fear in the dissection of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	## On the Dissection of the Hernia of the Throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Head 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This condition, called the hernia of the throat (apostema herniae gutturis), is a large hiatus, according to the colour of the skin, and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two modes: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly there is no skill in what is natural.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	Accidental, indeed, it is according to two modes: of which one is similar to thick knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an aposteme that results from the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And therein lies the fear, and it is not necessary to make a presumptive judgment about it with the iron, unless it be in what is barely perceptible: and you should try it yourself, and investigate it with an introduction.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a thick knot, and it is not suspended with any of the veins, then cut it as knots are cut, and extract it with what it contains from the cyst, if there be a cyst; and if not, then examine all of it carefully.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with what is necessary from treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	§ On the section regarding types of knots.
Caput XLV.	Head XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodules, and I have already discussed all their types in division; and it is necessary that I tell here the difference between a nodule and an exitum, as it creates doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore that when the exitum (abscess) is characterized by heat, fever, and persistent pain, until the overflowing suppuration has subsided and putrefaction is complete, then indeed the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	However, the nodule is not characterized by heat, fever, or pain, and it contains a cystic sac that is its own bag, and it takes on the color of the body; and it captures them as peas do, and it hardens like a nut, and there are both large and small ones.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two types: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I have discussed in division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you encounter a nodule and wish to treat it, you must feel it and examine it with the first instrument called an intromissum, according to the shape that comes after this one in the chapter.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the manner of examining the apothema and all nodules is to take this instrument and insert it into the moistest place that you find in the apothema; and you gradually push your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then, with your last hand, conform it to the measure of the size of the wound.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then, extract the foreign body, and consider what emerges with it.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a moist exudate flows, whatever its color may be; then dry it with a superficial section, according to what I have said in the other wounds.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moist exudate emerges with the foreign body, then know that it is fatty; so dry it above by making a section in the form of a cross, according to this form as I have taught you, and pull it out with hooks, and peel the skin from all sides easily, and guard the bag if you can above it, so as to extract it whole with the knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the cyst breaks apart during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, this often happens; then pull out parts of it until nothing remains.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if anything remains of it, whether little or much, the knot should be drawn back according to the greatest amount.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it binds you and leaves little of it behind, then fill the wound at the completion of your work with some sharp, dry dust; and tie it tightly, and place a hot compress over it, and care for it as with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If there is a large node, then both its lips and its cure must be taken into account, together with what it encloses.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	However, if the vein is pulsating or not pulsating, then prepare and fill the space with a third layer of protection, and leave it for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies and the bleeding stops: then return to incising what remains of the node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	§ On external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Head 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the forms of introitions, and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Indeed, there is a great one, and a medium one, and a small one among them.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	They should be made of iron, square at both ends, so as to retain the opening in the wound.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of experience, or rather, piercing, and one of them is called a drill, that is, piercing; and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Indeed, there is a great one, and a medium one, and a small one among them.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They should investigate through those openings, and their exits, and fistulas, and buboes that lie between them due to the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	Others become round, smooth, soft, like the large needle that they are inserted into, of citron, or bronze, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those that are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are also experiments to be made with black lead, which they use to test fistulas, whose emptiness is reflected back, as it softly conforms to those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because they are long, medium, and short from those [elements], according to the amount of the width and tightness of the fistula.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shapes of the punctures, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because they are simple, that is, with only one curvature; and there are three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are blind punctures: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them come hooks with two curettes, and there are three types, and from them come hooks with three curettes, and there are three types, and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels by which knots and stitches are cut and torn, and there are three types, since there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	The ends by which they make a cut are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp; and they are not used like this unless there is a firm grip in the lancing of knots at the site of a vein or nerve, so that the patient recovers from it and finds some peace from the burning for a little while after the excision of a knot.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are bandages, and they come in three types.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of linen, and they are similar to rags used for alcohol: at the end, a small point is hidden, through which it runs inside and outside when willed, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the spatums hidden among the fingers at the piercing of a knot; the patients do not feel them, and they come in three types, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The shapes of the windpipes by which the flow of blood is severed; they come in three types, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made round and somewhat longer from air or citron, as you see, and they should be thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And you should have these two kinds of vents with you, large and small, so that you can drain blood quickly when necessary, and then when you do not have any medicine at hand.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for draining blood in every part of the body, and only use them in fleshy places, such as the thigh, coxa, arm, mammilla, entrail, inguinal region, and similar parts from fleshy, moist flaps.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they are made into small tools similar to the shape of cherry pits, they can be used to drain blood when it flows from a phlebotomy site or near a vein or artery cut, and also when made round in this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	**On the care of human mammilla (teats) which resemble the mammillas of women.**
Caput XLVII.	Head XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the mammillas of certain men swell up at the time of sleep's completion (that is, when they begin to be aroused in sleep) until they resemble the mammillas of women, and remain so for a long time after.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	He who therefore rejects that (method), it is necessary for him to cut above the breasts with a lunar section, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape the entire fatty tissue.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with an ointment made from incarnate medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two edges of the wound with a stitch and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	However, if the breast points downwards and softens due to its own size, as happens with women, then it must be secured on both upper sides with two similar lunar-shaped cuts, of which each is contained with the other at their edges until a larger line contains the smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape the skin between the two edges and remove the fat, and apply what we said about stitching and poultices, which is necessary for healing, until it is cured.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	However, if you do not complete the incision that you need to make because of the patient's restlessness or due to the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with a submerged corrosive ointment and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	§ On the perforation of the apothecary, which happens under the titill (a type of fabric or bandage).
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII. Head.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	The conditions that occur under this heading are of the hard varieties of strokes (strophula), which contain a cyst and from them originate those that contain moistures.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	What are derived from those that contain moistures, these should be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b to line g. When all that is in the cyst has been drained out, then fill it with some clean wool and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the wool should be removed and the wound should be treated with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the cyst is of the type of hard strophula, then cut into it as we have said regarding cutting into equal parts of the strophula.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	However, if the wound extends to the point of emitting pus, then apply a caustic agent to it as we have said regarding what has been mentioned above.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	§ On the section of the cyst that occurs due to an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX. Head.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes hardened, a gangrenous condition often results from this; and the same occurs with veins, leading to gangrene and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is recognized that gangrene and swelling are due to an artery or vein are: for when gangrene is due to an artery, it is long and compact in depth in the body; and when you push your fingers into the gangrenous area, you feel a kind of hissing.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round and prominent on the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And amputation above this gangrenous area is erroneous, particularly when it is under the armpits, groin, neck, and many other parts of the body; and it is a very great risk.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with care using a knife, and even what remains at the extremities or in the head should be treated accordingly.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, over what remains from these after the swelling of the arterial opening, make an incision in the skin along its length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, after which free the artery from its tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a knife under it and cause it to penetrate until it reaches the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places, as I taught you in extracting the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then make an incision where the two ligaments meet with a spatula, until all the blood that is within it flows out and the wound is healed.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply treatment that produces pus until the ligaments shrink; afterwards, care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to the cutting of a vein, then you must hold with your hand as best you can the part that is causing the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a knife under the place that you held with your hand, and cause it to penetrate until you extract it from the other side. And put a double thread in it until you remove it from its other part.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind the abscess tightly with a good ligament: as I told you about the new ligament, from both parts with both ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If, however, you fear that the thread will come out, then insert another knife with a different thread under the entire abscess near the place of the needle wound; press and tie your threads at four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then make an incision through the center of the abscess until the contents are exposed. Then cut away the excess skin and release what is bound within it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place upon it the little piece that you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the dressing, which is done with lint and ointment until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	§ On the abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Head (L.)
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As the abscess occurs in an artery and vein, so it occurs in a nerve; this happens through beating or excessive strain, and similar causes, and is most common in the joints, or the sole of the foot, and every place where there are junctions that move: and it is a severe abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It resembles the color of the rest of the body, and is present in many dispositions without pain; and when it contracts with movement, the patient feels a weakness similar to numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a deep abscess in the body, but rather under the skin, and it moves to all parts, and does not extend forward or backward, nor to the sides.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what exists among them (the joints) should not be attacked with a sword.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, then, a contraction might occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, where it (the condition) exists in the head or on the forehead, find the skin with a scalpel.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If, therefore, there is an abscess of the skin, then hold it with tweezers and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then hang it with a hook and scrape it; then remove it, and dress the wound with a bandage; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	§ On the incision of an abscess, which occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Certain men suffer from numerous growths in their vessels and other parts of their bodies, which are called "Fungalia", due to their resemblance to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is thin, and whose head is large, and their edges are turned inward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And among them is a few, and among them is what is greatly admired.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have seen a man whose stomach had two openings, more similar to other organs than anything else; there was no difference between them, they were white and small, and their edges turned inward, fusing together, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore, cut them and you will find that one weighs as much as one and eight ounces, and the other as much as six ounces. The treatment in their incision is as you will consider then: if the patient is weak and moist, and has a pale, white, thin root, then cut it with a wide blade, and there will be cauterization in your presence over fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled during the section; therefore, if it afflicts you with blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see that the patient is weak and fearful from the cut with iron, then take a well-made lead thread and tie it around it; in this way as I have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the tension of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not therefore cease to tighten the lead whenever it presses against the flesh until it is completely removed and falls by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	However, if the swelling of the root is great, then there is something to be afraid of and fearful in making an incision, especially when it is within the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to make an incision through its middle.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it thoroughly so that it does not reopen.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not be led to think that you should make an incision on a lump that is of a dark colour, has little sensation, and looks putrid; for this is indeed a cancerous ulcer, and I shall return to speak about cancer afterwards.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	§ On the care of the tumor in the groin.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The tumor in the groin should be treated with urgency for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from the cracks if they are near the abdomen, the outlet should be through that or the intestine, according to what happens in other breaks.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from the blood that flows from a vein or an artery, as mentioned above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	It is constrained by its violence in that.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	However, if it is due to a crack and the outlet is inflamed, then it resembles the colour of the patient's body, and it is soft without pain, and its position appears different.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then its position corresponds to what we have described, with a greater diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	So when you press it with your fingers, it disappears, then returns and may make a sound, and it is very prominent at the entrance of the bath, causing great effort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is indeed due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is there any constriction or addition.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	Which, if it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears blackened on the skin.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	However, if it is due to newly formed flesh: then the abscess is grey, swollen, hard, and takes on a shape according to its quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is indeed due to heat, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that case is to consider whether there is an eminence of the navel due to blood from an artery, or vein, or vitality; then it is necessary to prevent treatment of it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that case there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of the apostemata due to the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the eminence of the navel is due to an intestine or a stone, then it is necessary to urge the patient to keep their breath and remain standing extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then make signs with wax around the navel of the whole body.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then instruct him to lie back between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then make circles with the hot spatula around the navel above the place you marked with wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the opening of the apostema upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him around the strong circumference with thread or a firm silk string; and let the knot of the ligament be loose.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the extended opening of the apostema above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you find that the organ is already captured by a ligature, then extract it, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen; and if you find the gallbladder, then take hold of it with a hook and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	However, if it is an artery or vein that opposes you, then surround it extensively.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then prepare for your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two needles into the circle that you made around the wound in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the wound in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the space until the flesh is putrefied and falls off on its own; or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what is necessary from ointments until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the hernia is of hard flesh within it, or due to moisture, then it is necessary to make an incision into the wound as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood or moisture that you find within it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then he treats the wound with what strengthens the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	**On the treatment of cancer.**
Caput LIII.	**Head III.**
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have described the division of the types of cancer and how the way to its cure is with medicines: and caution must be taken from it regarding its healing with iron, so as not to ulcerate; and we have described that cancer is generated in the matrix, and care must be taken from its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, such as cancer that is in the breasts, or the thigh, and similar places, from the body to be extracted whole; especially when it is beginning to grow small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it becomes very old and is large, it is not necessary to approach it closely.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself could not heal anyone from it; nor have I seen another before me who has succeeded in dealing with it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when located as we have described, is, as I have said before, to precede and free the patient from the black plague several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if you notice a notable fullness in the phlebotomy itself.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is spoken to about the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then insert into the cancer hooks that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then make an incision in it from all sides with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and allow the blood to flow, do not cut off the wound quickly or sharply, but carefully clean out the gross blood with your hand or, if possible, with instruments there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, the flow of thick blood from an artery or vein causes you difficulty, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	**On the care of Hydrops.**
Caput LIIII.	Head (IV)
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have described in detail the division of types of hydrops and how the accumulation of water occurs; also, the signs of each type and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are treated with iron are nothing but a mere imitation of surgery; and they do not approach the true nature of tympanitis with iron, nor do they fully embrace the essence of hysarca. For that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this condition as hydropisis (a type of tympanitis) with medicine, and your treatment has not improved it, then consider this:
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the weakness has already taken hold or there is another illness alongside hydropisis—such as cough, chest congestion, and similar conditions—then be cautious not to treat it with iron, for that is a danger.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	However, if you see that the patient is full of vitality and does not have any other illness besides hydropisis, and they are neither a child nor an elderly person: then the mode of treatment is as follows: you should take the patient in your hands, and the assistant should press the abdomen after you, by pushing water downward with their hand.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a thin, sharp knife, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It should have two sharp points, elongated, with a sharp end similar to the spatumile.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, it should have a certain degree of flexibility so that it does not penetrate too deeply during the operation, reaching the intestines, and causing harm to them.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	If there is a collection of fluid (hydropisi) from the intestinal tract, then it is necessary to extend with a cut from the navel three fingers in length downwards towards the groin, above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the collection of fluid (hydropisi) is due to liver disease, then your cut should be from the left side, starting at the navel with three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the cause of this is the spleen, then the cut should be on the right side, and it is not necessary for the cut to be made also on the left side where the patient lies, so as not to allow excess fluid to flow to that weak area.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then perforate the entire skin with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert your hand into the incision and use a forceps between the skin, and extract it, as if you were peeling an orange, so that the amount removed is about the size of a fingernail or slightly more.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then perforate the extracted part until the forceps reach the empty space, and this is the place where water lies.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract the tissue, and insert into the opening (foramen) an instrument of this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, soft and smooth, with a small opening at its lower part, and three openings on its sides, two from one side and one from the other: and its end is cut in the form of a pen's incision, as you will see; there is an armlet at its upper end.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	Now when the instrument reaches water, then it immediately descends over the instrument, thus drawing water at that moment to a medium quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you draw water from it more than necessary, perhaps the patient will die at that moment due to the resolution of his animal spirit; or he might suffer a fainting spell that brings him close to death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Indeed, draw water from it according to its strength and according to what is suitable for you, based on the condition of the patient's pulse, and according to its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is immediately retained by the skin that has a hole above it, of which I spoke; about which I said, pierce it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the process with the second instrument, if you see that the patient can bear it; and also extract a small amount of water from it.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	In those days, perform that operation without fear and guard yourself against error; until there remains no water except a small amount.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	However, if the patient is weak and has removed a great deal of water, then care for him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and under the sun, and let him rest over thirst; and treat himself with drying medicines until he recovers; and cauterize the stomach, and (perform) lancing and (treat) according to what I have mentioned above.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	§ On the care of infants who are born in places where their urinary passages are not perforated.
Caput LV.	Head 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When an infant issues from its mother's womb, and the opening of its head is not perforated, or the orifice is narrow or in the wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to assist with the perforation immediately after birth with a delicate spatula, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin lead claw in the opening and tie it; hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When the child, therefore, wants to pass urine, it should be moved and allowed to pass.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce the swelling.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not apply lead (plaster), it is possible that the urine flowing over the place will not allow the swelling to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening (wound) is narrow is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it widens.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in which there is an opening in an inappropriate place are damaged.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because the opening (wound) is near the end of the handle of the scythe; therefore, it cannot heal towards the front until the patient raises the scythe with their hand to higher levels.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	It is also not born in a normal way, because the sperm cannot reach the matrix (womb) straight; and it is a severe illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of treatment in that case is for the patient to lie on their back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the scythe's head with your left hand, stretching it greatly, and cut the head of the scythe from its previous place with a sharp point or chisel, similar to cutting a calamus or a radish, so that an opening is created in the middle as needed.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And be aware of blood flow during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, oppose it with what separates the blood, and treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	§ Regarding those that occur in the foreskin and scrotum, and corruption, blackening, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	Head LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These Albather occurrences often happen in the body, and it is a great evil for flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from these, some are malicious, and others are not.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, the non-malicious one should be suspended with a delicate hook and separated until it is completely clean.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place over it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat the same wound after that with dyafinic ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the abscess is malignant, with a discoloured pus, then after incising and draining it, cauterize the wound.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	However, if the abscess is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and it extends both inside and outside the foreskin, then you must remove the abscess that is inside first, until it heals, before caring for the outer part, because when you treat it at the same time, the foreskin will not be secure unless it is perforated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And it also happens in the testicles, with the foreskin turning black and decaying.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you must cauterize everything that has already turned black and wants to decay, or is already decaying.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a line over it after that with honey mixed with flour and ground herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then tend to that with the rest of the cure until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	However, if there is bleeding, then administer cauterization with a lunar cautery in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	Cauterization is indeed a combination of two dispositions at the same time, namely to stop bleeding and to heal a wound when it decays.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the hammer is corroded and destroyed completely in an instant, then you should insert a small leaden tube into the meatus so that the weak flow can pass over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the true adhesion of the prepuce to the hammer head, and this adhesion does not occur unless in one whose prepuce is healthy, and no circumcision is required over it; and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or ulcer: therefore, it is necessary to scrape off the adhesion with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the hammer head is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern the precise location, then you should scrape off a little from the hammer head and also from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the prepuce is thin, it may be easily pierced due to its own thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the prepuce from the hammer head using a thin piece of linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated with a sharp wine until it heals.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	§ On the purification of infants and the treatment of errors that occur with them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a remedy for all wounds, but when it is performed by our own hand, according to our will, and its use is appropriate for boys, it is necessary that we perform the operation in a better way, leading to a milder path to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not follow it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	This is because I find that a greater part of the work of surgeons and blood-letters involves circumcision with a needle and with scissors, and they use cauterization, ligatures with thread, and incisions with nails.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tried all these methods, and I do not find a better form of purification with scissors and threading.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in purification with nails, the skin often slips away.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the skin of the prepuce has two layers, therefore sometimes the upper skin is cut and the lower layer is torn; so it is compelled to incise again to cut another one, and future pain is inevitable.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when purification is done through the use of alkahest, that is, the digitus (the finger) used by surgeons, it does not ensure the safety of the incision at the extremity of the male member, since perhaps it enters his orifice.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	However, in the case of purification with a fingernail, it may straighten the iron and corrupt your operation, and the skin of a boy is naturally thin, and many are born like this so that they do not need purification. And you will see this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, with purification using shears and binding with thread, I have gained a good experience: because the shears are proportional to the incision, therefore, the sharpness above is like the sharpness below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharp edges are aligned and cut according to a single operation at the same time, and they form a compression with a similar shape, containing the skin of the shaft from all sides, so that no mistake is made in any way.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of operation is such that you can estimate a boy, especially if he is among those who understand a little, except for tying the thread to his shaft only; and leave it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him happy and joyful in every possible way from the fact that he receives understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not sit down. Keep the hidden scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his groin, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse that part from the filth it has accumulated.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the designated place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind the lower part with a slight turn of the second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb, securing the lower ligature's place well, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the penis head.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros.	Then allow the blood to flow slowly (it is better this way), and put a poultice on top; and over the poultice, place a cloth in which the cooked ointment has been spread in rosewater, and press it with oil of roses.
Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Lastly, apply it well and leave it on until the next day; then tend to the rest of the wound until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the scalpel for purification is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There should be two sharp points at the end, and they should meet; let no branch of the claw protrude outward; and the length of both edges should be equal to the length of both handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	An error indeed occurs during purification, because perhaps the entire inner skin or a part of it flees from the cut.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch it out from the moment you mark the place with your fingernail and then cut it equally.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If, however, they exceed three days and there remains something under the hook that is inflamed and marked, then leave it until the mark becomes hot and easily removed, and cut it according to what you have prepared, and be careful from the head of the hook.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not harm him indeed.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Take care of it with what strengthens the wound from the dust we discussed in the treatise on dust, and if it is cut into the skin beyond the required depth and widens towards above, it will not harm it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it as we have said until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	**On the Extraction of Retained Urine in the Bladder**
Caput LVIII.	**Chapter LVIII.**
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by congestion from stone, congealed blood, pus, flesh, or similar conditions resulting from the modalities of treatment we have described in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the bladder is not relieved and you see that the retention is due to a stone that is in the neck of the bladder, then he should be laid on his knees for treatment.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet are placed on his back, and he extends his breath from the upper part of his back, and tightens his weak breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, it is constrained with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone to the rear, wherefore the bladder is relieved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it does not relieve with what we have said and the condition of the patient is critical, then you should perform the extraction of it with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: made of silver, and very thin, flexible like the quill of a bird's feather in thinness, similar in length to the palm of one hand. It has a fine cannula at its tip.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the manner of exiting the wound through it is to take a doubled thread and ties at its end wool or cloth, a good ligature; and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if any excess of wool remains, and insert it into the tube with caution as before.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then moisten the syringe with oil or butter and alum; and make the patient sit down on a seat, and insert the vesica, and the patient's penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the penis with ease until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double the same part above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside until it reaches the vesica, and the patient feels that it has reached the empty place; and this is not done according to this order unless the passage through which it passes is narrow and twisted.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with the wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the wound will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it and make the wound flow through the urethra; and repeat with the syringe, and do not stop doing this until the vesica is emptied and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of enemas using a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	**Chapter LIX**
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a ulcer occurs in the urethra, or blood is congealed within it, or pus is formed and water and medications need to be introduced into it, then an instrument called a clepsydra should be used, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed closed, that is, obstructed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And it has three openings, two from one side and one from the other, as you can see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place where it is pressed should be according to the amount that fills it without adding anything, until something is pulled through it, then it is attracted by humidity; and when it is pressed, it expels it far away, according to how a clepsydra releases oil, that is, Greek fire in martial engagements.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore, when you want to release humidity into the urethra, insert the end of the clepsydra into the humidity and pull it with what presses it towards the upper parts, for humidity is drawn into the concave part of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert the end of it into the syphon as we described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then he drives away the moisture with what drives it, for the moisture reaches the wound immediately, and the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a delicate enema by which the wound is enemasated.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or gilded copper; let the head be higher like an almond-shaped bowl, and beneath it, a cavity through which the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the wound of an arrow, and place in it the moisture with which you are to enemasate the wound.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two cavities with a strong ligature of double thread, and heat the moisture slightly over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the enema into the wound, afterward, squeeze your hand over the wound with a firm grasp holding the moisture, until the patient feels that this moisture has now reached the wound.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, the wound is not immediately available, then take a fragment of parchment, and make from it a circle, and perforate it so that all its roundness is removed.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes as they unfold.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then add a circle around it, as you would with a wound: after you have placed in it what you wish to remove from humours, oils, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it tightly with the instrument and perform on it as you did with the wound from expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the wound.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	§ On the extraction of stones.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have discussed the division of stone types and their treatment with medicines, and I mentioned the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, those in the bladder, and their signs; also, the stone on which the operation is performed with the hand and incision, which is a stone that forms naturally in the bladder, as well as one fixed in a urinary catheter, and I am recounting all this with clear exposition and abridged explanation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore that stones formed in the bladder most often occur in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs, urine exits the bladder similar to water in its fineness; it appears with white sand, and the weak man rubs his catheter and struggles with it, and often hangs from it.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it protrudes, and the anus is expelled with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure of children is easy up to the age of fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young people it is intermediate, for it lies between these two [extremes], and the treatment is easier in those whose condition is better; but if their condition is poor, then the cure becomes a concern for them.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When, therefore, we come to the cure, it is first necessary that we cleanse the sick with a clister, which will draw out all filth that is in his intestines; for this itself sometimes prevents the stone from being seen during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient must be taken with his feet up and shaken and moved down to the lower parts [of the body], so that the stone will fall into the deep part of the urethra or come out from its high position several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands, with his hands under his buttocks, so that the urethra is entirely inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and feel him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the stone in the urethra, then immediately approach with the surgical instrument above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not come off completely under your touch, then you should use the index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a young boy; or the middle finger if he is a fully grown man: and insert it into his anus and apply pressure from the stone, until it rests under your finger, and gradually turn it towards the base of the urethra.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press it with your finger and push it towards the outside, against the place where you have made the incision; and tell the attendant to press the urethra with his hand, and instruct another assistant to stretch the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to move away the skin that is over the testicles in the area around the incision.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the speculum, which is shaped like this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find the space between the anus and testicles, not in the middle but on one side, towards the left side of birth; and make the incision above the stone, and place your finger inside the anus: and make a transverse cut so that the outer part is wide and inner part narrow, according to the amount that it is possible for the stone to come out from there without being too large.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger that is inside the anus, near the stone at the site of the incision, will press against it and cause the stone to come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that since the stone has angles and edges, it is difficult for it to come out because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it comes a soft part, resembling a gland, and round in shape, making its exit easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, those who have angles and margins add them to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit thus, then one must use skill over it: either tie it with a string carefully, whose end is like the Moon, which ties around the stone and does not slip away from it; or insert beneath it a fine instrument, with careful ends.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If, however, you cannot do the above, then widen the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something catches you with blood, cut it off with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If indeed the stone is more than one, then push the largest first towards the opening of the urethra.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push the smaller ones after it; and do likewise if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then ignorance is such that one must cut above it with a great section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it happens that a sick person suffers from one of two things, either he will die or he experiences constant urination; in the first case, since the wound does not heal at all, ...
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Indeed, administration of expulsion should be done until it is released; or, with forceps, the fracture should be manipulated until it is extracted piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with turpentine, aloe, and dragon's blood; tighten it and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water to cool the hot abscess.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then place the sick person on their back, and do not loosen the ligature until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, then wash the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with a salve of dyaphricon and basilicon until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs in the wound, and there is suppuration and similar things; as if blood becomes congealed in the veins and urine is prevented from passing through it; then that is known from the discharge of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore, insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood from it.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes the vein to corrupt and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then rinse the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; apply to it whatever is appropriate from treatment, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And during the whole course of treatment, it is necessary to bind both thighs and groins together because of the medicines placed on the site.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If a stone is too small and is caught in the urethra, and it becomes fixed there, preventing urine from flowing out; then treat it with what I have mentioned before you reach the sectioning stage.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Indeed, I have often avoided surgery through this treatment, as I have already tried it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, as you take a perforator of iron, whose form is triangular with sharp ends, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie the urethra to the stone beneath the skin so that it does not return to its original path.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the wound with ease, until it reaches the perforator on that very stone; and then move the perforator with your hand slowly over the stone, and cover its perforation, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	It is immediately emptied (or cleared).
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand over what remains of the stone from the external side of the weapon.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It breaks itself, and is expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed of his illness.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If, however, this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from doing so, then tie a thread under the stone and another thread over the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry the stone on the weapon itself between the two threads.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it (the stone).
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the thread, and clean the congealed blood in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to have a thread of the thread under the stone unless it does not return to the wound; and another thread above the stone, unless when the thread below is loosened after the stone's removal, the skin returns to its place, and closes the wound; and for that reason, when you tie the upper thread, you must draw the skin up towards the higher parts, so that it returns to your completeness, and closes the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of the female stone.
Caput LXI.	Head LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The stone is rarely found in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	However, if such a stone occurs in any of them, then treatment is difficult and prohibited due to its many modes.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that a woman might be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is that you will not find a woman who conceals herself from the physician when she is chaste or has a husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is that you will not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the manual operations.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the remoteness of the location of the stone: for it requires deep incision, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	Which if necessary provokes that, then you should take a woman physician, well-versed, and she is hard to find.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If indeed you desire this, then seek a chaste physician, subtle, and a well-taught woman obstetrician in matters of women, or a woman who has learned this art; so do make her present, and especially to her, so that she does all that you command her regarding the inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, one must check if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary to insert a finger into her vagina and feel for a stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If he finds the stone, he should press it with his finger and then immediately summon the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina and feel for the stone. After that, he places his left hand over the opening and applies gentle pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If the stone is found, then it is necessary to gently move it away from the vagina opening towards the lower parts with the utmost care until it reaches the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should cut it off near the middle of the thigh at the root of the hip, from whichever side it presents itself, and feel for the stone in that area. His finger should not move away from beneath the stone, and the initial cut should be small.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should insert the knife blade over that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels the stone, then he should add to the cut according to the amount that the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you should know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From it is a small and great one, soft and harsh, long and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore know the kind of it, as it will be shown to you by this over that which you see.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood seeps into you, then add to the place three layers of bandages, and keep it tight for a time until the blood stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then prepare for your operation until the stone is removed: and do, as you prepare with the instruments I mentioned for the extraction of stones from men, to help you with them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If blood flow seizes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut; then put powder on the place, and tighten it with small bandages suitable; and do not leave it unbound: and release the stone, but do not extract it yourself.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the sick woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the acuteness of the blood subsides after days, and the place putrefies, then prepare for your operation until the stone is removed.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On cutting through a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	**Head of Chapter LXII**
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia occurs only when there is an accumulation of moisture behind the peritoneum, which is beneath the skin and contains the testicle; it is called a hernia.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is enclosed within its own sac, which nature has prepared for it in a certain part, until it can be extracted; this is another testicle, and it lies beneath the skin of the scrotum, as we have said, and this happens rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	The cause of this condition is the weakness that occurs in the testicles, which allows this material to flow towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And it can also occur due to a blow to the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or it may be of a declining colour to yellow, or red-brown, or putrid, black, or water-white; and this is the most desirable.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one knows where the accumulation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	If there is any problem in the operation as we have mentioned, then the aperture (incision) is round and of a length somewhat greater than that of the figure; and the testicle is not visible since it is contained within by the fluid.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is fluid in the pouch itself, then the aperture (incision) is round and bulges a little, and because of this, someone might think that it is another testicle.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if there is fluid between the skin of the testicles and the white (scrotum), then it falls under the sense (of an operation).
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When one has perceived the colour of the fluid, then examine the colour of the fluid in the aperture with a square instrument, whose form precedes (the operation).
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, according to what emerges from the sign of the instrument, judge what is between them (the testicles).
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we come to cure with the iron (scalpel), then one must urge the patient, if possible, to have blood drawn from him so that you may see his body full of it.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should be laid on his back on a high place slightly, and many cloths should be placed under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left side, and bid the helper to sit on his right side, who shall stretch his patient's arm to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide spatula and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along the length, almost to the chest: and make the incision according to the straight line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white part that surrounds them: and clean and observe, or be careful from this, so as to cut yourself: and let your excoriation be where you cut yourself, from the part that hangs with the egg more: and delicately examine the excoriation according to what is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then make a wide hole through the white part with pure water and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the section with hooks, and extend the white part towards the upper parts, and do not touch the skin of the testicles that surrounds it: and cut the white part however you can cut yourself, either in its entirety or partially, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine the incision, there will be no security, and water may remain.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	However, if the egg proceeds from its skin during your surgical hour: then when you have completed the incision of the white part, bring it back (the testicle).
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with stitching.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself as with the rest of the wounds, until it is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a wound corrupted from blackness by something else, then it is necessary to use tying instruments, which are the suspensors, in order to prevent blood flow.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspensory ligament and extract the wound; afterward, care for it as we said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches; so dry the other part equally as you did with the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it agrees with you, so that it becomes one operation, then do this: afterward, wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the sections a thread soaked in oil or rosy oil; and place outside another thread than you soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles, and stretch the entrails: and place on top two doubled cloths, which are small; and tie them above with a ligament that has six turns in this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and moisten them, and fill them with red dye according to this likeness: and make the ends by which it is pressed from cloth or wet wool; and join them with a tight belt around the loins; and one end should be taken over the buttocks up to the back, and the second should take hold of the part of the chest; and two ends below over both thighs, and two other ends above over both inguinal regions, and join the whole tight belt around the loins.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes, this ram is treated artificially with a cautery at the site of the section with iron; and it is as if you take the cautery with a delicate knife and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and it is inflamed, as we have described. Until, when it reveals itself as a white, healing mass containing water, then take the cautery in this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It assimilates Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with that healing mass, and it is inflamed until all humidity is expelled.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the healing mass with hooks, and scrape it with a fine, ignited cautery, and cut into it as much as possible for you until you eradicate all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And cauterize from the egg, so that it does not touch the same fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more salutary, and less prone to blood flow, and better than an operation with section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, it causes you opposition in the hour of section or in the hour of cautery, a hot apostema or blood flow or something else: then you must care for what causes you opposition from that with the cure that is fitting to it, as has been mentioned above.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	However, if the patient is timid and does not expect this operation because of his fear, then administer the perforation as I describe that it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you have certified to yourself through what we said about the meaning of what is liquid (the limb), then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the fistula at the lower part of the limb with a wide spatula-like tool, and make the incision according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a bandage over the wound and bind it tightly, allowing it to drain the remaining water, then care for it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	However, if there is a problem with the drainage of water at the time you pierce it, and this is not due to the white skin making a counteraction in the wound opening and preventing the exit of water, then you should insert a needle into the wound or an instrument with which the water of hydrops is extracted, whose form has already been described, or add to the operation of the wound slightly.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and is aggregated after six months, or about those times.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it therefore aggregates, it will be healed in the same manner, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of muscular wounds.
Caput LXIII.	**Head XIII.** 
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that in this section on this ramice, there is a risk leading to harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, I consider its abandonment as a salutary step from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am reminding you of the operation on it, and the type of scar.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, therefore, that many scars occur in bodies, from which the testicles are formed: and this happens for many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an excess of acute fluid, which flows towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from striking.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the colour of the scar is according to the colour of the body, and it does not cause pain; and the scar is grey.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps the scar is bony, which has a dark colour, and does not cause sensation.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it occurs from the knotting and swelling of arteries, as has been mentioned before: or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	What is therefore derived from their (arteries') expansion can be known through the position of the pulse when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary to touch it directly at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is derived from the expansion of veins does not disappear from it when pressed with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that an incision can be made over this type and over the other flesh: and it is as if you were to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the foreskin upwards and extract it with a clean blade, free the suspensory ligaments from the cavity, and tie the vas (spheres) with a ligature, and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from every part of its attachments.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the foreskin is consolidated with those born tissues, then you must grasp the foreskin and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between something from the foreskin or in that which is between the vas (spheres), then you must free all of that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	However, if there is a born tissue at the place of adhesion which is behind, then you must cut it all and extract the foreskin as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	After your operation is complete, fill the wound with gauze soaked in rose oil and wine. Then tend to it, along with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the care of ramics (or stitches) which is done with wine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 49.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is a condition known as apoplexy, when there is some kind of inflammation within the brain, similar to a botch, accompanied by a softening of the testicles; and this makes it difficult for the patient to move or exercise, or even walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	In the treatment of this illness, fear plays a part, because of the remembrance of what came before.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Indeed, we must say that the treatment of this (illness) is according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, therefore, that it is necessary for the patient to sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then, push the suspenders of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, when you feel what is near the scrotum; and have another assistant hold them, and stretch them out gradually.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then he incises with a broad and sharp spatula, crossing the section directly over the vessels, until the vessels are detected.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then he removes the skin from all parts, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temporal regions.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then he fixes them with a sharp knife where the double filament is located, and ligates each one at the first places where they occur; and ligates them again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then he cuts them in the middle of the straight section according to the length of the body, and extracts what is aggregated from foul humors that are corrupted.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then he treats the wound with the treatment of the remaining wounds, where blood is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle fall off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not a bad thing through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If, however, the vessels are blocked in all of them, then they should be extracted for this reason, so that the testicles are not deprived of nourishment due to the cut, and it does not become weak or withers, and there is no pain with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	**On the care of intestinal ramified vessels.**
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The event of this ramicus is from the section that occurs in the case of an incision made on the perineum over a vein in the inguinal region extending into the abdominal cavity.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from an incision or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis.	And these two types occur from many causes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from impact.
Aut saltu.	Or from sudden movement.
Aut clamore.	Or from noise.
Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	Or from the elevation of a serious condition, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from the extension of an incision.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what happens gradually over a long time and does not happen suddenly: it is an equal distance towards the deep [cavity], because the incision compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of its presence when it is from a cut with a knife, because it causes a sudden severe pain from the beginning: and it is an apostema that is diverse, visible under the skin nearby: and that is due to the exit of the intestine, and its course towards the outer part of the cut.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And it sometimes emerges with the intestine twisted: and this is called the "twisted intestine" or "twist," and it can occur with vigor.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs into the intestine and gets stuck there, bringing about great danger, especially when pressed upon. For it causes severe pain and, in particular, when pressure is applied.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of conditions of this kind, there is fear of iron, so one must be cautious about cases involving it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of treatment is to urge the patient, so that he reduces his intestine with his own hand back into its proper place if he obeys and it returns.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it is lifted up over its collarbone between your hands, and its legs are raised.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards towards the higher parts, and dry the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two jaws of the cutting hook, as needed to open the cut with them; and the cut should be according to the quantity that it is possible for the intestine to emerge from.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Next, scrape the skin from the sinus and the areas beneath the testicles, until a white, hard membrane is exposed from all sides. Then insert your index finger into the space following the testicle, in the area between the white sinus membrane that is beneath the skin, and the second sinus membrane, and firmly adhere to the posterior part.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then, with your right hand, pull the inner skin of the testicles; and as this extends the white sinus membrane upwards with your left hand, gently press the sinus with your right hand to expose the part to be cut. And instruct your assistant to extend the membrane upwards, and you will carefully loosen the adhesion that is at the back, completely detaching it.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And ensure with your fingers that nothing remains intact from the intestine within the white, hard sinus.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	However, if you find anything remaining from it within the sinus, then push it towards the lower venter.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take some thread, in which there is a thick filament made from ten threads, and insert it near the last sinus, that is, the tunic covering the testicles, which follows the cut; then cut the ends protruding from the thread, until there are four threads remaining.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over others in a cross-like pattern and tie them with the silk from which we spoke, since it is a strengthening ligament beneath the skin covering the testicles, until nothing of the substance that nourishes them can escape, so as not to cause any hot abscesses.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And again, place the second ligament according to the first, distant from it by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments, divide from the scalp, which is under the skin of the testicles, in the amount of the size of a finger, and cut through it all according to its roundness, and remove the ovum from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which the blood flows, and heal it as we have mentioned above.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a cloth soaked in oil to the wound and place it on the cut; and apply the ligament as we have mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white scar that we mentioned is cauterized, be careful after cutting it to prevent blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligament until it falls off on its own.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if the case delays, then it is bathed with warm water; and apply over it what we have mentioned until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then tend to the wound with the rest of the wound care until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	On the Rapid Branch
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this chapter of the text, there is no record of anyone daring to perform surgery on it with a blade.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And they said first that it is done as we have narrated in the chapter which is about the rib (and the blade's impact on it).
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is, as you tie the blades after the section above them with ease below; then cut in the middle and treat it afterward with what opens it up, until the blades fall off; and heal the wound, according to what we have said, until it is cured.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	§ On the disruption that occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the opening protrudes and does not descend to the testicles with any part of the intestines; and if it does descend, it is minimal and returns to normal within a few hours; but if it prolongs with that condition for some time, an additional fissure develops in the scrotum until the intestines descend completely into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that occurs from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groins, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is because the wound extends: then it softens, and the space is filled, and it protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with cauterization, as the preceding account has described.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with iron, in this manner: and he lies so that the sick person rests on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the space of the rupture that has become filled and protruding, by cutting across its width, according to the amount of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the edges that are under the skin, until when the white wound beneath the skin is exposed, which follows its course.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a knife, and place it over the protruding wound from the skin, and press it deeply into the entrails.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then make two incisions over the ends of the knife from the wound, and connect them with a stitch, one to the other; then remove the end of the knife.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the wound at all, nor stretch it, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then the care concerns the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you make an incision with a knife, clean it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The wound contracts, and no additional prominence of the rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better in this place, because it is closer to healing.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	§ On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Head LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	In some men, the skin of the testicles softens frequently because the flesh surrounding them softens, and its appearance becomes discolored.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, he who is asked for his treatment should make the patient lie down on his back and cut away all the softened skin that has become loose from the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then sew together the two edges with stitches: if there is any surplus of the softened skin on its first three stitches, or four, make a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then incise between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then attend to the healing of the remaining wounds, until they are healed and the stitches fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	§ On castration.
Caput LXIX.	Head LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated by our law, and for that reason it is permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine, and its remembrance is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of these is that it should be known to a doctor when asked about it, and that he knows the cure for whoever has suffered from it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another reason is that we often need to perform castration on certain animals for our purposes, such as rams, wild boars, cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that castration is performed according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by traction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by making an incision, and sectioning.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In such cases where friction is used, the method of operation is as follows: We make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles become soft and relaxed and hang down, then we apply pressure with our hand until they resolve and are no longer visible under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	However, in castration through an incision and cutting, you must hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspenders and dry over each cut one by one until two eggs pass, then incise them after cleaning both, and do not leave anything from the sac on top other than a thin film which is above the testicles.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which uses friction, because friction may leave some remnant from the testicles, so the animal might still engage in copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	§ On the care of hermaphrodites using two methods.
Caput LXX.	Head 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is similar to men according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in the space it follows, or on the skin of the testicles, where it is between the two testicles, shaped like a small woman, with hair; and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	However, in women there is a single type, and they are like a small man over the chest, with their testicles protruding outward; of whom one is like the penis of a man, and two like his testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment for three types, two of men and one of women, is as follows: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until the impression of them flees.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then, the care of these injuries is with the cure of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	However, in the second species of men, from which urine emerges, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure for it.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	# On the Incision of the Clitoris and the Protruding Flesh in Women's Genitals.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The clitoris may be added on top of the natural state until it becomes corrupted and takes on a disgusting appearance; and sometimes it is so enlarged in certain women that it expands like the penis in men and reaches up to the act of copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you must hold the excess of the tentigin (tissue) with your hand or a hook and cut it; not too deep into the incision, especially into the deep root, so as not to cause bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the healing of the wound until it is cured.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, a problem arises when a part born in the mother's womb does not grow to its full size; it may emerge towards the outside according to the form of a tail, and for this reason some call this condition "tail-like" disease.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, we must cut it as we cut the tentigin (tissue), and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	§ On the care of the Alratic (condition), which is a ulcer in an unperforated woman.
Caput LXXII.	Head LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratic is when there is an ulcer in an unperforated woman, or when there is a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is when it arises from a previous illness: and it itself becomes formed either by the addition of flesh grown out, or by a thin or thick crust; and it occurs either in the deep part of the womb, or on its sides, or on the upper part of it, or the lower part of it; and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and delivery, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of it is acquired through observation of the obstetrics if the pregnancy is evident and close.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	However, if it is not evident, then seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	However, if the pregnancy is from a very subtle sign and it is close to both lips, then approach it and break it off.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you place two small pieces of cloth over the lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your two hands simultaneously, and have the woman lie on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch the two lips with strength until the subtle sign breaks off and the pregnancy opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a thread, soak it in oil, and place it on the area: and have the woman press it every day so that the wound does not harden again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	However, if the sign is large, thick: then it is necessary to cut it off with a broad, sharp blade like a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	However, if the pregnancy is from flesh growth, then suspend it with hooks and cut it: and be with medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and pitch mixed with wax.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a broad pipe of lead, so that the wound does not harden quickly, hold it for several days, and then apply a liniment made from dry flax, after which it should be treated with the remaining care until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes, when a new growth of the flesh is born, it should be cut according to this method; for as long as there is no cancerous ulcer - because the cancerous ulcer that exists within the matrix cannot be opposed entirely with iron.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	§ On the care of hemorrhoids, Athaliel, and Bothor the red in women's bodies.
Caput LXXIII.	Head LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of veins' orifices, as long as they constantly discharge a great deal of blood.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids therefore become enlarged, they turn into theils (varices). I have already spoken about their kinds, signs, and treatment; here I will say which receive cure from them and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are within the matrix opening, and do not appear to the senses; then there is no cure with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those that are from them within the matrix, over which sense does not fall, these are the ones that are to be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Next, extend the edges with shears or a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then, clean them near the flow of blood from one of the cuts without causing a wound: such as Acacia, dragon's blood, pitch, and similar substances.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then, push her feet against the wall at that very moment.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood continues: then make her sit in a mixture of sumac, and quince seeds, and gall, and similar substances.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a paste with it to apply it over her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore blood comes out with it, it is good; and if not, make the skin on her back sticky and moist, without scarring.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take a cloth, and dip it in the juice of tarathit, or argan, or grapevines, that is, pomegranate wine, and make it adhere tightly.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the abscess has ceased to exist, then care for the wound with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albucasis truly describes the red rubor as resembling the heads of garlic, and it has a harsh appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut what appears from it, according to what I have said in the previous chapters, equally, and care for itself until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	§ On the perforation of the Exit (or outlet) that occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Head LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the matrix, such as cancer, stone abscesses, ulcers, suppurations, erosions, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and erysipelas.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already spoken about all these ailments and their kinds, and the signs of each, and their treatments in division: it is necessary that I should speak in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the matrix, when it is from abscesses that collect blood, and how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the apostematis is acute at its onset with its percussion, and with flame and fever: and you see it turn red: if it falls upon it sense, then you will not rise with its perforation: and treat it as it pleases above the maturation, until such time that the acuteness of the accidents ceases.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then you must make the woman sit on a seat that can support two cushions, and lean back or lie down on her back, gathering her feet towards the lower part of her belly; and let her hips be spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, and tie them with the appropriate strap to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side and use an instrument to open the maternal orifice.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Which form comes to those that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And when you see to administer this instrument, you must insert it deep into the woman's matrix, so that what enters from the instrument is not deeper than the matrix itself and does not harm the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument were deeper than that, then you must put threads on the cover of the deep matrix, so as to prevent the entrance of the entire instrument into the deep matrix; and you must pull back the thread that runs in the instrument from its upper side, and hold the instrument, and unfold the thread by turning it, until the deep matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When the exit (orifice) appears and is touched by the hand, and it is soft and supple, then it must be incised near its own head with a wide spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the pus is therefore drained, then it is necessary to apply to the wound a compress soaked in rose oil or verdigris oil, which has some astringent property, and after applying the compress, remove the section deeply into the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place on top of the matrix, and over the comb, a clean wool cloth soaked in water with small stones.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment suitable for it until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and wound are completely cleaned, so that they can be cleansed with water and honey, then afterwards with water containing the root of lilies or long aristolochia, and finally return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the matrix, then it must be prevented from healing with iron, but rather treated as we said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	# On Midwifery: How Embryos with Abnormal Birth Positions are Treated.
Caput Lxxu.	Head 70
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know, first and foremost, the shape of a natural delivery.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs, it follows that when you see a woman pressing herself down towards the lower parts, desiring to smell the air, and relieved of what is above her due to childbirth, and hastening the exit of the fetus - then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is over her own head, and the second stage follows with it: either suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press her belly so that the fetus descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over her own head, the second stage follows with it, and they are cleansed of these excesses with a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	However, if it deviates from this birth, it is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus exits on its own feet, and its body comes out before its head and feet, or one hand or foot at a time - or its head and one hand come out together, or it turns around over its neck, and similar unpraiseworthy forms occur.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, the obstetrician must be prudent and clever in all of these matters, and beware of errors and deceptions - and I will show every figure from them, and how the skill is in it, and it is signified by that, and stands above itself.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus comes out from its mother's womb in a natural and violent manner, it becomes difficult for her to give birth, and you will see that its strength is already weak; then have it sit on a seat or have women support it. Moisten its lips with a mixture of fennel seed and boiled fennel, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert her finger slightly into the vagina and find the second stage, then cut it with her nail until it drains from the humidity, and press on the woman's womb until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If, however, it does not descend, then the woman should be enema'd with a mixture of fennel mucilage and sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then after the enema, order her to press herself, and make her sneeze with the conditions, and hold her jaw and nose at the same time.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If both hands of the fetus come out first, then you should bring them back with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If, however, it does not obey during the introduction, then place the woman on a seat and lift her feet up; then suddenly shake the seat on the ground; and have someone support her so she doesn't fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remaining fetus, and tie his hand with cloth, and extract him with care, for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo is on its own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges on its own feet, it is necessary to push them upwards, then turn the fetus slowly, and finally release it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and extend it slowly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge up to the thighs, then command them to be pressed and make it sneeze with a condition; for it will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out as we described, then bring the fetus back slowly until you place it according to its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will come out then with easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prevented from coming out as we described: then take from the mucus of the womb, and oil of myrrh, and dissolved gum, and strike all of it well in a mortar; afterwards, with a thin instrument, cut through the vagina and into its uterus below.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she achieves relaxation.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that her lower parts have become heated, then prepare for her a seat of myrrh and place her upon it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore she has retained the myrrh for an hour, then make her sit upon the seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze; and hold her mouth and nose, and press gently on the lower part of her belly.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fever will depart immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	§ The exit of the fetus is over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it exits in this manner, then insert your hands gently during delivery.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie down on her side with her head lower than her feet, and she should rest her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gently on her belly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under her feet from the tissues, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take its feet and move them with a steady motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypogastric region gradually until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then he should insert his hand and gradually grasp the fetus, and especially instruct the woman to press until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus, hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	The hand should be maneuvered for reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If, however, it cannot be reduced, then lift the woman up and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk, then make her lie down on the bed and shake her legs with a steady motion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment you prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she accepts the delivery, then have her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive to reduce the hand and adjust the fetus according to its natural position; make the woman sneeze and instruct her to press herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	When the fetus emerges over its own neck, with hands spread out, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the fetus' hand, then gradually and slowly deliver it, ensuring ease in the process.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it (the fetus) is thus equated, then place over its head what we have mentioned from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command it (the fetus) to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	After you have done that, then make it (the fetus) sit on a seat and command it to lean towards its right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command it to compress (itsself) and make it sneeze when ready.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The delivery of the fetus prepared on its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the mother according to this manner with the forceps, then cut the forceps with your finger until it is evacuated by moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it (the fetus) is suspended over the face and neck of the mother, then cut it (the umbilical cord) from the navel: so that it does not retain its life and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus towards the inside until you place it as required, and instruct the woman to compress herself several times; for thus it will emerge through the vaginal opening.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	On the emergence of twins or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or even four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is unusual and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Indeed, it is a matter outside of nature, and they do not live completely; and it contains them, even if they multiply, in such a way that they are separated by a gap, distinguishing between them the ligament attached to each other at their navels.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge as one fetus does through a natural and easy birth canal; but they emerge through an unpleasant channel, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If certain ones of them become difficult during childbirth and come to that which we have mentioned from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have narrated: and be it a narrow passage, let it do what it does with ease or tardiness, and be shaped according to every figure as it is prepared for it by the guiding craft towards health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder that it is formed inside the womb from embryos, and they miscarry.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, or more than ten are formed in the womb; and now it has come to my knowledge that a woman gave birth to seven, and another to fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which is done according to the measurement of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all this should be so that it is in the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps they will come to know something similar to it; therefore, let them oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	§ On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with the method I mentioned in division from medication, and it does not exit, and you need to extract it by hand, then you should consider:
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore a woman is of sound constitution and is not affected by any of the accidents from which there is fear of her loss: then it is necessary that she be placed on her back on the bed, with her head inclined downward and her legs raised; and let two attendants hold her or bind her to the bed so that her body does not slip out during the extraction.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then he moistens the mother's bone with humid oils mixed with alum, fennel, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then she greases her hand with these oils and muds, and then introduces it into the mother (womb) easily.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he seeks with it the place where the hook (of the placenta) is attached from the fetus, and suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore, consider then if the fetus is prepared to come down over its own head: then fix the hooks into its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its beard, or in its furca (fork of the spine), or in places close to the ribs, and under the ribcage.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If, however, descent is over its feet, then (the hooks) are fixed into its chest and the middle of its ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And he must hold the hook with his right hand, and place the tip of his left hand between its fingers, and then introduce it (the hook) easily, and fix it in one of those places we mentioned, until it reaches a free space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he fixes another hook in its opposite (part), or a third if necessary: so that the contraction is equal and does not lean towards any part.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended equally, and not just in a straight line, but moved to every part so that its outlet is healed, as is done with the tooth during extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that there be relaxation of the extension in what lies between them.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part is retained from that, then it is necessary for the midwife to moisten certain fingers with oil and insert them from the side, in order to separate what is retained with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks are changed to another place that is higher; do this until the whole fetus has emerged.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand emerges before others and it is not possible to reduce it due to its tightness, then it is necessary for a cloth to be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until the whole of it has emerged, cut it or make an incision in the joint of the foot, or at the elbow; and thus you should do to the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	However, if the head of the fetus is large, or there is a tightness during its exit, or water has accumulated on it, then it is necessary for a spatule with sharp edges to be inserted between the fingers and find its way with it through the head, and extract the water; or break it itself with an instrument called an Almisdac, whose shape comes in accordance with the shape of the other instruments that follow it.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus has a large head due to nature, then it is necessary to cut open the mother's abdomen and extract the child with care, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then, with forceps, grasp the bones.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head should come out and become stuck at the level of the forceps, it must be carefully extracted until all the moisture within the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	However, if it does not complicate or resist extraction, then cut the head as best you can.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower abdomen is infected or there is hydrops within it, then pierce it until all the moisture drains out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the fetus is in a normal position relative to its feet, then attracting and directing it towards the mother's womb is easy.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	However, if it becomes stuck near the womb or chest, then extract it with the cloth you have wrapped over your hand, and unblock the womb or chest until all that is within them drains out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	However, if the remaining limbs are removed and the head is returned, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the womb is therefore open, then he should insert his hand into its depths and find the head with it, and draw it out by means of his fingers until it reaches the mouth of the womb; subsequently, he should introduce one hook or two hooks in it and pull it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the womb becomes contracted due to the heat that befalls it, then one should not labor over it; instead, one must then administer flows of moist substances, ointments, and have it sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it may be corrected; then, what we said regarding a living fetus should be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible otherwise, then it should be cut open and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything from the second layer inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said regarding the hot apostemas that occur in wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there is a flow of blood, then it should be lowered into strict waters, and the remaining cure should be administered.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have seen a woman whose womb was dead; then she became pregnant over it again by another man, after which the other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time, a separation occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened, and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called upon to treat her, and I medicated her for a long time; yet the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I then applied to it certain bandages with strong adhesive, and pus exited from the site.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	After that, several days passed, and another pus exited from it.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed therefore when I saw that there was no pus left in the wound.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I then examined the wound and extracted many bones, while the woman was in better conditions; and after having been in such a state for a long time, it now began to discharge only small amounts of pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not confirm this foreign object here unless it is known that there is knowledge and assistance to it, which the skilled physician administers with his hand from the treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	**On the shapes of instruments necessary for extracting a fetus.**
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the strap (strictor), which equalizes the books, to which are applied two pressure points equally on both ends of two wooden boards.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this hinge (vertigo) must be made more delicate with a tighter strap: and it should be made either from ebony or hard wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of all wood should be like two fingers: and each margin is like one finger, and the length of each is a palm and its middle; and in the middle of the two wooden boards are two additional pieces of the same type of wood, which have already been firmly attached to both, whose length is the middle of the palm and a little more: and the width of each is like two fingers, or a little less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additional pieces are inserted into the mother board's hole so that it opens with them when you release both hinges.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the hinge (vertigo) when it opens the board.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	The other shape is similar to it, more delicate, and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made of ebony or hard wood, according to the resemblance of the pincers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the extremity of it, there are two additions, as you will see above; and the length of each addition is about a palm, and the breadth of each is equal to two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	If, therefore, you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, her feet hanging down, and open what is between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additions joined together into the womb, and you hold the extremity of the lower part of the instrument between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with scissors, equally as much as you wish to open the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wishes.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of the other vertigo than what the ancients said, the shape that impels the fetus, which is impelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The shape of the forceps, through which the large head is contained: it resembles a fork, with teeth at the extremity, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it becomes oblique, according to this shape, like the forceps that you see, with teeth like sawteeth, which cut and contain.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The shape of the forceps that contains the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of dissection for holding a single spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of dissection for holding two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of the forceps with sawtooth teeth, used to grasp the fetus's head.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of the scalpel with two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two scalpels, also wide.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments all exercise their functions, and the more diverse they are in type and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker they are for his work, and the superior they are among men due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not despise this instrument, but rather have it prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	The need for them is indeed inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	§ On the extraction of the secondary (spine).
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the secondary (spine) is held during childbirth, then it is necessary to gently support the weak ones so that they retain their breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make it sneeze when you are ready: and press your hand over its mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it therefore emerges through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If it does not: then take a cup and pierce an opening in its lid, and place in it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as fennel, rue, anise, chamomile, yarrow, and cassia wood, and centaury; or some of them, and steep them in water, and place them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a wick of reeds over the opening of the cup, and the other end in the mother's mouth, and hold it until steam reaches the depth of the mother's womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	Indeed, it will emerge with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, it remains after this treatment and does not emerge, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or a mixture of egg white.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert into the womb, and seek with it the second one.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When he has found it, then he should take it and gradually stretch it out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	However, if it is attached deeply within the womb, then he should insert his hand as we have described, until he finds the second one, and slowly extract it according to its right position, so that the womb does not fall due to a forceful pull; indeed, it must be turned with ease to the right and left sides: then add to the amount of pull.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It then obeys and is held firm, freed from its adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If, however, the womb is contracted as we have already mentioned, then care should be taken with sneezing and from the use of an ointment made with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If, however, it does not come out with all that we have mentioned, then be careful not to tire yourself out in re-attempting the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed, it is necessary that what comes out from the womb towards the woman's hip be bound to her thigh.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then, apply a cleansing enema with a four-ingredient ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	It will indeed putrefy her after a few days, dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrefies, a bad smell is eliminated from it and reaches the stomach and head, and it hurts that invalid.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, it is necessary for them to administer the appropriate fumigations to that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancient experts have already been experienced with the fumigations of nasturtium and dried fig.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the instrument used for fumigating a woman during retention of the secondine (a midwifery tool) and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let there be made of them a similar alcama (fume hood) or from a vase: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and place the fumigation on top of prunes: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	§ On the healing of an unperforated ankle.
Caput LXXIX.	Head LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born, and some of them have unperforated anuses, which have already been softened by subtle purification.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife must perforate it carefully with her finger: and if she does not, perforate it yourself with a sharp spatuli (a surgical instrument) and be careful not to touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place a cloth soaked in wine and oil over it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	However, if it becomes swollen, then insert a lead pipe into the wound over several days and remove it when the child wants to eat.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now it happens that the swelling of John comes from the healing of the wound or the abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it is necessary that this consolidation be cut away, and then treated with what we said from healing and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	**On the healing of fistulas occurring in the lower part.**
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX (80)
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are called a "Nodation" or "Grossitude" and they may occur near the anus, either in one section or multiple sections; there can be one fistula or more.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that nodation becomes old, it opens up, and moisture from it is either clear water or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are these fistulas penetrating through them.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, they are known to penetrate through what is ejected from the wound, and their force, when the patient uses the bowels: and perhaps it emerges from them in a twisted manner.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they become fistulas when they penetrate into the space up to the vein and even to the heart's pulse.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they penetrate from these up to the hip joint, and even to the knot of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	However, if you recognize the penetrating fistula up to the anus, even from what is not penetrating, it is as if you insert your index finger into the anus: and you try to gently insert a thin instrument into the fistula made of air or iron: when there is no torsion.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is torsion in them, then insert into it a thin lead probe or an equine hair until you feel the probe or the hair in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it deeply, nor does anything emerge from the wound, or pressure, or pain as I said: then know that it is not penetrating. So, proceed to treatment accordingly.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to the vein or to the urethral opening: then its meaning is that urine exits from it, and its blockage prevents the wound from healing with medicine.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it really penetrates to the hip joint or to the hip bone: then a sign of this is that the pain reaches there and continues until it reaches the bone, if there is no curvature leading to the bone; and the pain in the area around the part, and the discharge of pus from it always; and that treatment does not heal it nor does it solidify with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these fistulas that penetrate deeply, there is no cure at all; the treatment of them is a matter of toil and vanity for foolish doctors, upon whom their formation depends.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	However, in those that are not penetrating and are not old, there is hope for healing with a scar, according to what I will tell you, and I have already tried it: and it is as if the patient lies between your hands on their back; and lift their legs up to their hips, and their hips are inclined towards their belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then they insert a lead or air probe into the fistula if there is curvature inside, until you know where the pain reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the patient feels pain around their anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel in your finger that the pain has already penetrated by itself, beyond what you feel between your finger and the anus or the flesh; then you will certainly know that it is penetrating. Therefore, do not struggle with it, because its healing is not like we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said, however, that in some men, the flesh is healed and relief is expected from treatment, by cauterizing the wound gently according to its width, as was mentioned before, and inserting the burning instrument into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then they repeat this process twice or three times, until you know that all the added flesh is charred, similar to little tubes made of feathers.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then they treat it with lard wrapped in cloth until the charred flesh emerges, then they apply ointments that nourish and strengthen the flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is healed therefore, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it is never healed with other treatments.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it fails to emerge and does not reach your finger inside the anus, and there is a thick flesh or scar between them, then you see a fistula following the skin's surface, so dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you cut the probe that is in the fistula as you cut through it until the cutting reaches the end of the probe, and the probe is freed and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean the flesh that is similar to little tubes made of feathers so as not to leave anything from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If, however, blood ties you and releases you from between yourself and your surgery as it cuts those meats, then better and quicker aid is to cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Since cauterization with fire promotes good habits, adds the combustion of those meats, and stops the flow of blood, as well as dries up humors.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it with lint soaked in butter or crushed scales, until the place releases pus, and those burned meats emerge into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for the wound with consolidating ointments that form hard meat: and are medicines in which there is constriction and drying up.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is nourished, then it is already healed: and do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If, however, a fistula has already reached down to the deep anus and extends from the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a strain, and between you and it is a tear from healing or flesh, and it is close to penetrating: then there is no operation in that, unless according to the path of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is because it is administered in one of three ways: either by cauterization as we have said, or by cutting it out until you achieve its dissection, so that it becomes possible for you to insert a treatment and cure from next to it.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too far with the cut, so as not to injure the nerve that contains the anus, and it happens that there is a discharge from the inferior opening without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of it as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal: either by extending the wound or cleaning it after drying it close to the anus as we have said, or with a probe or another sharp-ended instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean the filtered flesh that is in the cut, until you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try to restore the wound of the whole cut, and the upper opening where it is reinforced: and a fistula remains open on the inner part of the anus, and it will be less painful for the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when a fistula is sought after this manner: and it is, when you insert the probe into the fistula: then take the perforated ends, which are like a fine needle, that is, the preparation of the corium, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a soaked thread from five threads, and encircle it roughly.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert a probe with a thread into the fistula until it reaches its depth.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it is penetrating the inner edge of the anus close to (the opening), then extract the thread from that orifice; so that you can insert your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and join both ends together: tighten them both, and release it after one or two days; and the more the thread penetrates into the flesh, the tighter you should hold it, until the tissues between the two ends of the thread are incised and they fall away; then tend to the wound until it heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	However, if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in any way you can prepare, except if it is too deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	It is not necessary for you to make it penetrate for the sake of the thread, lest you cut into itself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the surgical knife with a sharp point where the fistula is found, whose edge is acute and sharp, while the other part is not acute so as not to cut what is unnecessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the sewing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows following an incision into them; and on the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	**Chapter LXXXI**
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids according to two modes.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are within the anus, resembling the seeds of figs or grapes, or they are like new grains.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small and large ones; and blood flows from them always, it is one and many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremes.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are in most cases few in number and moist, from which a yellowish water flows, or a little blood flows constantly; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is within the anus is to urge the sick as if to ease them; and it should be expressed until the anus is freed, and appears clean to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, therefore, also hang them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then incise them near their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If, however, they do not retain the hooks due to their humidity and the softening of both, then take them with a rough cloth or with twine made from double linen thread, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then incise them and sprinkle on them some hot powdery substances to keep them in place at the site of the cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the cure until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If, however, the anus does not obey to let it pass, then apply a enema to the patient in whom there is a small fissure, so that it may wash away what is in the anus and quickly obey when the patient expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If, however, the threads are external from the anus, then their condition is lighter and easier; and it is as if you take them with your finger or with a hook and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we said before until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And if one shuns the cutting with a knife, then it is necessary that you administer their stitching according to this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the soaked thread and insert it into the wound.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then extract the thread towards the upper parts and make it penetrate with the point on the other side of its root: and entwine both ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be lateral: and tighten the thread's knot firmly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie a knot on the thread and extract the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the threads and leave one: do not let them slip, so as to prevent the excess of blood from flowing out.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over it a cloth soaked in rose or saffron oil and put the wound on top of it: and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the threads have fallen off, care for them with ointments and the rest of the cure until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	**On the care of fissures.**
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Many times accidents occur due to the exhaustion of feces and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	Therefore, since ancient times, when there is no medicine in them, one should use the point of a spatula or your fingernail, until they become moist and the upper layer of skin that prevents their healing is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them until they heal as necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	However, if they do not heal: then repeat the process with a stronger reason than before, until there is much bleeding and then take care of them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	§ On the treatment of gangrene, both of open and closed wounds: also of athelia (fester) and sores, and of formicae (fungal infections).
Caput LXXXII.	Head 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that gangrene is not anything but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a pin; and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers, and results in pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut off what is around the head of the pin, and hold it with pincers or a hook, and pull it out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then attend to that care: and if you wish to cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	However, if the wound is deep with a small eminence, rough, filtered, and round above the surface of the body,
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And this often happens in the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the treatment is to stretch the wound and cut it open; or tie it tightly with a silk thread; or with a hair, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine; and then the wound will be cured, either turned inside out or not, without using an instrument that I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A tick, however, is a small, filtered, thick eminence above the surface of the body that penetrates deeply; and when it finds cold, it feels like the bite of a flea, affecting the whole body, especially the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the treatment is to take a tube from a duck's feather or a strong vulture's feather, and place that tube over the tick, until it contains a circle of the tube's parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the tube until you remove what is around the tick; and place it deep into the flesh, and root out the tick from its base.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, make it with a tube of air or iron in this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Place the upper part of the tube over the dead and enclosed swelling to draw out the fluid so that it does not interfere with the finger's grasp and its own resolution.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish to cauterize the fly as described in the cauterization of Ethelil in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	§ On the forms of instruments used for clistering in diseases of the anus, and also for the treatment of colic and bloating.
Caput LXXXIII.	Head 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes the clister is made of silver, or brass, or iron forged or hammered.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made of these materials in small or large sizes according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered for the cure of small children should be in small amounts; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, similarly their clisters should be.
Clistere magnum.	Large clister.
Cistere paruum.	Cysts of the lungs.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its [the cyst's] base, that is, the upper part where the uter is tied, should be wide according to this manner; and there should be a distinction for it to be tied like the uter as you see, and its inferior end which enters the anus should be blunt, that is, not open, soft, very much pliable towards thinness; and on one side of it there should be two openings, and on the other side one opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the opening should be according to the thickness of the radii, and a little larger, and the uter in which medicines are placed should be from the vesica of an animal, or from paper tubes that are in the form of a small funnel; whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced with many openings as required, and there should be space between each opening that is the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those openings a strong thread from raw silk, which should be from ten or so threads, and bind together with it the other uter like a funnel.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When the uter is thus placed in it, tie it at the head of the cystern with a strong twine between two distinct constrictions.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then sterilize it with that.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of a circle and the hole depicted here.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of cleansing with it (the enema) is such that you should fill the colon either with a warm or hot solution from medicine according to the tolerance of the patient, and because it should not be too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie down on his back and raise his legs towards the upper body, and place underneath him a sheet or cloth on which the patients lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then moisten the tip of the enema with oil or alum or with a mucus of fennel or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert the enema into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then have the assistant hold the enema with both hands and squeeze it out forcefully until all that is inside the enema bag is emptied into the colon.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the enema and have the patient raise his legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine makes him want to evacuate, then he should hold it as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is the final step in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you cleanse him with a cloth in the maladies of the bowels and hasten his excretion, then repeat the enema until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful fissures in the anus, then use a delicate enema with a gentle flow, similar to the enemas given to children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a delicate enema, over which there is tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	§ On the healing of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have spoken in the previous section about the treatment of wounds, and here I will describe their treatment with the hand and with medicines as a supplement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore that wounds differ according to the type of wound they are and according to the place on which the wound lies.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The wounds that result from such events are often similar to the impact of a stone: whether it be a cut with a sword or knife, or a blow with a spear, wood, or arrow - and other similar objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds, however, which occur according to the parts of the body, are such as a ulcer that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or any similar part of the limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling of the treatments for certain wounds, so that I may set down this reasoning and rule over the other wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, since the memory of the composers will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When there occurs a simple wound in the head, and there is no fracture of bones: consider then, if it is due to a blow from a stone or something similar, and it has already injured only the skin: and it is a large wound, and you fear that the outcome for the affected limb will be bad because of the heat: then rush, and perform immediate cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay it: and extract blood from him according to the amount of his vitality: if nothing hinders phlebotomy, especially if the amount of blood coming out from the wound is small.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And the phlebotomy should be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And the patient should be careful not to overfill himself with wine or heavy food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If something prevents diminution (of a wound), then it is diminished from food, and it does not approach the flesh or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if there is a hot ulcer, apply to it a poultice of rose-colored oil alone, or with wine that has a constricting property.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	However, if you are free from the hot ulcer, then place on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood and has not changed to a different color, the poultice I will describe shortly; and if it has already changed its color, then place some ointment on it until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large, or it is from a sword cut, or something similar, and its edges do not come together due to poultices, then bring them together with stitching, as I will describe regarding the wounds of the stomach about their stitching.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound has already been detected from the bone and hangs down, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension, then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then tend to the wound with medications, and restore hard flesh where the skin is missing, and particularly instruct the patient to take food that has bulk, such as grain heads, and cooked wheat, until it becomes as soft as a pulse; and similar foods.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin that does not adhere to the bone, then cut off the entire putrified part and throw it away; afterward, tend to it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, there is an artery or a vein through which blood flows in these wounds and it cannot be cut off by means of drugs, then investigate the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If you find it unextracted, then dry it with a spatulum or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Which, if it is necessary, as it does not produce what we said, then cauterize it until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light: so as to apply poultices over them this poultice: because it solidifies them before they change.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	§ Mode of the poultice's application.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part olive oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts unburned lime: warm the whole thoroughly, and sieve it; then fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly until it adheres well to it, and coagulate it with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tie it tightly from above with bandages, and leave it, neither loosening it nor moving it until it heals, so that it does not fall off.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For it is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes, when only this calx is available and you do not have frankincense or dragon's blood at hand, it still performs the same operation on many great wounds when it is placed over them and tightened, and they are recent wounds with their own blood that has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If the wound has already been affected by air in some way, especially during the summer season, then this powder's intention is not effective. Therefore, take care of it as we have said, putting on top of it certain prepared ointments or, until pus is discharged, pastes made from barley flour with water and honey.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the rest with treatment until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If indeed it happens with a wound that the bone is fractured and it is small, then extract it with care. And I will now speak of the cure for fractures of the skull, which we shall discuss in the future.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	# On Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Head 75.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a wound of the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	However, if the nerve of the collar or an artery has already been incised, then, if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except to ensure that its cure is done with what causes constant tightness, like a belt and bands and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Since nerves cause pain and strain them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And never put anything cold over the wound at all, because the substance of nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher among the limbs; and that should be treated by medicines gently, such as a hot compress with sweet water infused with oil or rose oil and myrrh, when it is also washed with sweet water, and other mineral stones according to this manner, and wet ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, the wound is large, then apply stitching; or close its edges with small threads.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound is indeed deep, or there is a cavity in it that has collected pus, then perforate it at a more depressed point.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If an artery has already been incised in the wound and its blood flow is occurring: then separate, or dry it up, and tie that; or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, the spine is already incised into the throat or completely through it and the inner parts are safe, then close the edges of the skin with stitches over the cane of the throat, without touching the throat itself, but rather equalize it and bring it back to its natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten the wound gently and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound with ointments that have a constricting and drying effect until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression in the bone, then probe it: if there are fragments of bone within, remove them entirely or as many as you can: leave what does not come away until the wound putrefies and separates, allowing its discharge to escape.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then apply poultice over it as I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If however, bone is visible in the wound and a fistula forms: then treat it as you would with whatever remedy is mentioned in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	**On the wound in the flaps (spatulas)**
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a piercing of the lance or the knife, and you see the depth of the wound, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore from the wound comes a sudden flow of blood, and when it draws out the patient, you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and it bleeds freshly with its own blood, then do not put powder on it at first nor tighten it, so that the blood does not get stuck in the depth of the wound and return to the heart, causing harm to the patient; but rather apply a drawing ointment to it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If you do not have an ointment at hand, then put a piece of old cloth over the wound to draw out what comes out from it due to moisture; and make the patient lie on top of the wound so that whatever is gathered there can flow away.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed three days or more have passed since the wound and no spasms occur to the patient, nor bad heart tremor, nor tightness in breathing, and you see that his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	So take care of it with bandages and the rest of the cure until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If healing occurs and the wound opens up permanently, then know that a fistula has already formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, treat that very part from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or razor, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat that very part from its own chapter if it is large; or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	However, if it has already made an impression in the bone and a splinter is protruding from it: then examine the wound, and proceed to extract the splinters if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separated, then leave them be until the wound putrefies, for extraction would only worsen it.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	Judgment on the accidents of wounds in the rest of the body is the judgment we have described regarding their cure.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	§ On wounds of the abdomen, and the issue of intestines, and their discharge.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the intestine is great, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore, when the great (disruption) allows the intestine(s) to exit or the number of intestines to be exposed.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why this intrusion and their more difficult and intricate sewing happened.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small disruption becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that the reduction of them becomes more difficult if you do not properly proceed to their place at once; for it is inflated, opened, and enlarged, making the entry difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, the medium disruption of them is best; for when their reduction is not difficult as it is in these two species, it becomes easier to open them.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the stitching comes about according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	The two common stitches converge in the stitching of the abdomen and in the stitching of the rest of the body's wounds; and the other two stitches properly communicate with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper for the stitching of the abdomen; and I will tell you each one with its exposure and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, because when the wound is small and something from the bowels comes out of it, making its reduction difficult; then that is due to one of the two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because there is an inflation in the intestine due to a chill in the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore that condition obtains, then it is necessary to warm the part itself, so as to immerse a sponge or damp cloth in tepid water.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in a mixture of squinantum, kyper (cyperus), and spice, and wrap the intestine in it until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	It also makes wine, which has a constipating effect, and it is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflammation resolved, then moisten the intestine with the water in which the herbs have been boiled, or with lukewarm water.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For it should also facilitate the entrance of air, with a small amount of movement.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, it returns to its original state after this treatment, then find a small wound in the hemorrhoid with an instrument used for cutting them.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the initial treatment is better when prepared than cutting; and force should not be used to cut after the need has passed or because of a lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Sit the part of it that is bent, acute, and the other part not acute, and its tip be not as fine as a needle, but rather slightly obtuse; and this resembles chalk, as you can see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound has healed and entered the intestine, then it is necessary that it be reduced to its natural form in its proper place, as far as possible; for this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When there is a wide disruption in the lower part of the entrails: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the entrails, then place his head and chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the entrails, then direct your attention and always consider that the part with the wound be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it is necessary that you treat these in great wounds and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, follow what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it so that there is a present helper between your hands, who holds the disruption with both of his hands, and closes its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then, using that, he removes from it something here and there, following the suture; and this is the common method of suturing one thing to another.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, as you take a sharp point, or a number of sharp points according to the extent of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then, from the edge of the wound, measure with your finger an amount equal to that of a ring finger, that is, of the surgeon; and sharpen one point, then insert it into both ends of the skin while pressing the two inner parts beneath the skin until you make it penetrate from the other side, and at this moment you have joined together the two ends of the skin, as well as the two inner parts, and there are now four sides.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then, with a double thread, tie around the needle several times from both parts at the same time until the two lips of the wound are joined together properly.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then, let go of the ring finger's thickness and sharpen another one; fix it in place with a thread as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not therefore cease to do that as needed with the needle, until you have completed the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the needles should be of medium thickness between fineness and thickness; because fine needles penetrate flesh very quickly, while thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin; for that reason, they should be of medium thickness between fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be pierced through both extremities of the skin close to each other very much; so as not to quickly pierce the flesh or open the wound before its healing, and not to stretch when stitching, so as not to prevent the wound from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the needle so as not to injure the patient at his rest, and place small pieces of cloth on both ends of the needle, which hold it together; and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since it suffices for stitching them with one, or two, or about those needles.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second kind of stitching is common, as it aggregates four ends when stitching: two ends of the skin and two other ends brought together at once with a needle in which the thread is wrapped equally in thickness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced with the needle these four ends, bring the needle back to the part from which you started, so that the threaded string falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitching is like the stitching of cloth with which clothes are sewn, and put between all the stitches a quantity equal to the thickness of a smaller finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of stitching is known by people.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch, I treated the wound that had occurred to a man in his abdomen, who had been cut with a knife, and there was a large disruption of the wound spanning one palm from the middle intestine; and it had protruded from the intestines approximately two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I therefore reduced it after the intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound therefore healed within approximately fifteen days; and I cared for it, and it was cured, and after that it lived many years, restored to its former state.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors had judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I had not treated it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where I could not find ointment, nor anything from medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore placed on the wound two times a day the usual poultice, and I persistently washed it with honey-water until it was cured.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now describe two types of stitches according to the narrative of this discourse.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And so you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert it from without to within the part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	Thus, having pierced the skin with the needle, and proceeding along the wound according to the length and breadth of the whole body: leave the end at the side into which you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate from within towards the outer end on the other side.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	Having thus made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this same end from the outer part towards the inner: and leave the end that is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from within outward; and with your penetration, as you make it penetrate into the end that is on the inside, which is in that part, until it penetrates into itself completely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin again from this same side, and with the same end, which is on the other side of the inside, and extract the needle from the skin through which it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then insert it back into that skin, and with the same end which is on this other side, make it match with this extreme; extract it from the flesh where it started, and do so once more, and then again: and continue thus in succession until its whole length has been extracted according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the completion of this suture is such that it wraps around the wound as if it were closing the skin; so that you leave the end from one side on one part of the skin's edge, and release the other end from the other side until it is completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	A second type of proper suture, as Galen described.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is how he describes their use, as if they were weaving them in a manner similar to that in which some surgeons join all parts to the one appropriate to nature: and they apply one end of the thread to its other end, and the other end of the thread to its other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is how it works, as I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must now attach the thread to the end near you from the outside part, and make it pass through to the inside only; and then release both ends of the other thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then take the thread again, and make it pass from the outside to the inside in both ends of the other thread.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then take both threads again, and make each pass from the inside to the outside, to the other two ends of the thread which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of stitching is better than the common easy stitch, and it is the stitch whose recollection has come before.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This, therefore, is the speech of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And certain men said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The wound is corrected with the use of two blades.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, so as to insert into each one thread by means of a single needle: and begin with the insertion of the needle from where it is in your possession, and cause it to penetrate until it reaches the other side, according to the wound of their skin that is equal.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is disruption in the middle of the entrails, then the stitching of it is more difficult than the rest of the places of the entrails.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The true judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of the rest of the wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	This is because when you treat a fresh wound with its own blood, before it is altered by air, and reduce the intestines, and their own skin, and make them suitable: then place a covering over the flesh's corruption.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound, then place on it some of the ointments that are present to you, until they form pus: and the threads fall off, and they heal completely, and miraculously.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as the cure for the rest of the wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If you do not have access to the necessary medications, then place a clean bandage on top immediately, from which the pus will begin to drain, and change it twice daily, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	You do not need other medications in most cases when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	However, if the time comes when the wound affects principal members of the body in the injury, then it is necessary to soak a linen cloth in warm oil or rose oil and place it around the affected areas between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (which often happens), then enema him with astringent wine, black and warm; especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and becomes an exit that penetrates until its core.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal, and what comes from the thin ones is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine called the jejunum does not admit healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and that is because of its multitude, being composed of small parts, and the magnitude of them, and because of the subtlety of the body, and the nearness of its own nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which proceeds from a wound is gangrene, and you find it fresh: bring it back according to your method of reducing it, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, a space has indeed been left and it has already formed into a wound, either fresh or black: then you must tie it up with a thread above the place that has become discolored from it, so that no blood flow occurs.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In gangrene, there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and leave both ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its pull will be directed away from you, and the extraction of that piece at the place of the gangrene, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	**Remembrance of the wound that occurs in the intestine.**
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there is a rupture in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible for it to be restored in some people: because I have seen those who were wounded in their abdomen with a lance, and the wound was from the right side of the stomach, and the old wound: and a fistula formed, and it discharged excretion and flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore applied treatment, until I was not convinced of its healing: nor did I stop gently massaging it, until it was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I had seen the wound healed, I feared for the patient, that something might happen to him within his belly; and nothing happened to him from that incident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in his best condition, eating and drinking, and having sexual relations, and he entered the bath, and he continued with his routines.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some of the experienced ones said that when a wound happens inside the intestine and it is small: then one should bind it in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is as if you take ants of great heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two edges of the wound, and place an ant on one of them which has an open mouth over the two edges of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it (the ant) climbs onto it and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it sticks and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and keep doing this until all wounds are filled with ants according to their number.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the pressure, and heal its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For indeed, some parts of the intestine remain attached until the intestine is fed and healed, so that it does not suffer any further damage to its innermost part.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And indeed, it is now possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread; which is taken from the intestine of an animal and attached to it after being inserted into the wound.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is also possible to take the end of this thread from the intestine and let it be exposed for a long time.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then, tie the end of this fine thread with a thin line sewn into it.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the wound and sew with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the swelling into the wound.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of stitching with silk and intestine is nothing but according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is great, wide, especially if it is in one of the intestines' graceful folds: then there is no skill but diminution, and there is no healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	## On the Care of Ulcers and Fistulas
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that every wound or ulcer, when it becomes old and hardened, forms a fistula, which does not heal and always emits pus, and is not severed. Then it is universally called, regardless of the part in which it is located, fistula, and we call it by that very name.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	A fistula, indeed, is a true, filtered, hard, white nodule; it is painless but has the appearance of a feather. For this reason, some call it risus, meaning "feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	In some cases, it is damp and emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture may break apart in certain cases.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes there is much of this moisture, and yet there is little; it can be thick or thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor has flesh born in it, is nothing but due to one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of these nine causes, one is either due to a lack of blood in the body, or because of its malice; or because there is hard flesh between it and the lips, preventing the birth of flesh; or because there are many sores and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter sent to it is of bad quality; or because medicine is unsuitable for its cure; or because corruption falls in a region that is a kind of pestilence, or due to the property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of ailments is difficult, and the healing of ulcers is delayed by nature; or because there is one mouth, or a certain number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I now reveal all the causes and signs of these conditions, as well as their treatments with medicines in division; and here it is necessary for me to make you know the treatment of fistulas and incisions, which are made through a path of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore know that a fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them (fistulas) there are some that affect major veins and arteries, or nerves, or openings; or they reach the intestine, or the urinary tract, or any part of the ribs; or they affect the joints of the spine or any structure composed of joints, such as the hand and foot; and from them there are those that extend to the vicinity of the main member and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, from these fistulas in this way, is difficult to heal from illness and does not accept treatment, and dealing with them requires effort and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from fistulas that some of their depth do not reach the places I have mentioned; and you hope and trust in its healing, and seek to gain knowledge of it, then accept attempts with iron or steel if the fistula tends towards straightness, and examine it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is curvature in the fistula, then investigate it with attempts using a thin lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since lead, due to the softness of its body, is alleviated and cured around the deformity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If there is a fistula with many openings, it is not possible for you to apply treatment over it effectively.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, wash it out from those openings through its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	Since the humidity through which you wash it out, flows towards other openings, and passes out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire as to what manner it is possible for you to know whether there is a bone or a nerve, and whether the cavity of the fistula is distant or near; or whether there is one fistula with many openings which overlies the whole of it, with all your strength; when you ask about the patient's condition, and at the site of compression with your hand, and by similar signs and causes of accidents.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When therefore you stand by all those true stations, then proceed to treatment according to your confidence; and consider at that time, if there is a fistula near, visible, or far away in a healthy place from the joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then dry the fistula as mentioned above from my narration, and remove what is in it from discharge, and corrupt flesh, which arises at its opening from the flesh or matter similar: and treat it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If there is a fistula of great depth and straightness, then you must cut it as deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse that part from all corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply a pure lye in sharp medicines and insert it into the depth of the fistula which you have reached with your knife: do this several times until the sharp medicine has dissolved all that remains in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If indeed it does not heal from that, then cauterize it as we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you have verified it, then remove it yourself and dry it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you from cutting any vessel, nerve or main member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If you therefore find a bone that has any corruption or blackness, then scrape it until all of the corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with what makes it heal until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, examine it a second time, make a precise assessment of it, and carry out purification with all your remaining strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals, then it is good; but if not, then know that that corruption is deep and you have not reached its root.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	You do not have any skill in this except to let nature take its course.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the flesh is rotten and it is possible for you, then pull it out with thin forceps suitable for that part.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	However, if there are many bones, then carefully extract them all, using all your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If something contrary happens to you from humours and there is no fear or mistake in the cuts, then cut away those humours and flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If it is not possible for you to remove the bones at that time, then place over the wound that which will cause it to rot; and leave it until it rots as much as is around those bones in the flesh and humours.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And the incision should be narrowed as much as you made it during your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	In my opinion, place on it, if necessary, a cloth soaked in tritured sulfur with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some kind of radiant ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when these putrefy, that is, the moistures separate from them and the bones detach, the loss of them should be alleviated and their attraction removed.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	However, if there is a single large bone, such as the shank bone or the hip bone, and similar ones, and that which has been corrupted from it is a significant part, then it should be cut with the last reason, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If indeed that which is corrupted in it is a significant part and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it needs to be tightened and cut entirely up to the point where the corruption ends; then care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you the story of what happened to a man on his leg: so that you can use this as an example and help for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years old who experienced pain in his leg due to a condition that had developed inside his body, specifically from the internal organs, until it reached the leg, causing a great abscess. And there was no external cause for this.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, much time has been spent on his treatment due to the error of the doctors, until the abscess opened and many materials converged with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And the treatment of his leg was postponed until an abscess formed, and multiple openings were made in it, through which pus and bodily humours drained.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So it was treated by numerous doctors for about two years, but there was no skilled surgeon to attend to him until I was called, and I examined his leg, and the materials flowing from those openings, which had taken on a great deal of movement: indeed, the entire body of the man had wasted away, and his skin had turned yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I carefully examined all the openings, and I found that they connected with each other in every part of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I then probed and followed one of these openings until I found the bone itself corrupted: it was already decayed, blackened, putrefied, and perforated, until it had reached the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I have therefore dissected what I have discovered and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I determined that there was no corruption of the bone other than what could be cut away and dissected.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had now eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied the restoration of the wound with long spaces filled with medicinal consolidants.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried again, and I discovered another bone above the first one that I had detected: and I found continuous corruption with the bone; and I dissected what appeared to me from this corruption as well.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted the restoration of it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I therefore examined it again, and I did not stop striking the bone separately, and I tried to restore it; but it was not restored until I cut off about one palm-length from the bone, and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicine, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; and this repetition of the operation and cutting off of itself was not needed any further because of the disposition of the weakness of the illness, and its lack of endurance, and my fear for it concerning death: for it was subject to fainting from excess of vomiting at all hours.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Health is therefore complete healing, and flesh grows hard in the place of the bone; and its arrangement in its body becomes good, and its strength returns to it; and it is changed into its dispositions; and it causes no harm to its walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	However, if a prominent bone in the body is already broken, it must be secured in this way, and so it is: take hold of the ligament and tighten it at the end of the protruding bone; and instruct someone to gently stretch it upwards, and place another ligament above it, using a thicker thread for the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh that is next to the bone, and stretch the end of it so as to draw the flesh down; and you will remove the flesh above the place where you want to tighten, in order not to harm the cut.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a wood or board under the bone precisely, for when you do this, it will not prevent but rather cut away the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that there be a tightening over the corrupted place for some time, so that there is no decay of the bone; and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and incites to another tightening.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, then a deep part of it continues with another part; and the corruption is in the middle or in another part of it; then remove the flesh from all parts completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the wooden splint below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Next, cut that part from the first side where the corruption is, until the fracture is continuous from the other side, and make the splint according to the length of the fracture as we mentioned before.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is at the joint, cut that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it continues from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no skill involved in it except for scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the thumb or toe joint: then the case is very difficult indeed.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Indeed, it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it, and clean it as best you can, and adjust it with any skill you have, so long as it does not cause opposition from a vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the cutting and sawing of these bones require many incisions, according to the position of the bone, and the preparation of them, and their thickness, and size, and thinness, and rarity, and hardness.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you the kind of instrument you need when you are engaged in a lengthy study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of these methods is a testimony to the ways of illness; for then you will indeed find within yourself what is suitable for him from among the instruments for every sickness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am firmly telling you at the end of this chapter's discussion the number of instruments you will be making examples from and testing on others.
Forma Serrae.	The shape of the knife.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of another knife.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the other knife.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the other knife. (Repeat from previous response due to request for confirmation or clarity.)
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of the knife is depicted, as it were, done with great care.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its bow be curved upward, its edge sharp like iron; its handle made of boxwood and formed pyramidally with great care.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of surgical incisions is joined.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Place the head of this razor according to the form of the star-shaped keyhole, and its points correspond to the shape of the elastic hook's points.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not fit unless the incisions' heads are rubbed with it when they become corrupted or widened, and it is large and great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the medium razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the lateral razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the razor where there is curvature.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of the other razor's fine point.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of the other razor's curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of the razor's delicate hook.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The form also of the great razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	It resembles the saw, and its end is like a blade; it is exhibited in many places for the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the razor that corresponds to its function, which is perforated for bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, the tips are sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	It is suitable from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it is necessary that all we have said about razors, scalpels, and saws be done.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	§ On the cutting of tips and the locking of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The tips putrefy, either from an external or intrinsic cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated the putrefaction with medicaments, and it does not yield to treatment, and you see the putrefaction affecting a member, without causing pain; in that case, you should cut off that member as far as the putrefaction extends, so that the patient may be freed from death or from the evil which is greater than the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of that which happens to it is that the member turns black until it can be healed; whether it was burned by fire or rotted after turning black: until that rot spreads throughout the entire member and body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when making the next cut, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is due to the impact of certain venoms: such as those of the sea scorpion, wasp, bee, and others.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption or impact is in the end of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave any space for the corruption to spread, so that it progresses to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it off at the root of the finger, and do not leave any space for the corruption to spread until it reaches the end of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it suddenly occurs in that place, then cut off the arm at its elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption spreads, and you see it around the elbow, then there is death of the limb.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And beyond that treatment, it is the quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly for the foot, when corruption suddenly occurs in a toe, then cut it off at one of its joints; and if it reaches the arch of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it ascends towards the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If the damage has already reached above the knee, then there is no cure for it, except to release and let the afflicted person die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the manner of cutting the limb is either by sawing or cutting through it, in order to tighten the ligament below, which you should cut: and tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the assistant stretch one ligament downwards, and let another assistant stretch another ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, using a broad scalpel, until the whole flesh is detached.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut or tightened.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you cover all parts with a linen cloth, and do not allow the saw or cut to touch the healthy place; and add to the afflicted a new wound and a hot poultice.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, bleeding occurs internally while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly, or place some absorbing powders on top to stop the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded member with a suitable ligature and attend to it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you about what happened to a man on his foot, the same thing that I am telling you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	Which is because a blackness occurred on his foot, similar to the burning of fire, and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it spread throughout the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	So the man pulled off a part of himself, after he saw that the corruption was spreading to the member because of its pain and burning, and it affected the joint; and thus he healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, the same corruption occurred in his index finger.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I tried to recover that superfluity with what I put on his hand from medicines after cleaning his body; but the superfluity did not stop, and it started affecting other fingers until it spread throughout the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called for me to cut off his hand, but he did not want it, hoping that I could help with the rebound of that superfluity, and I feared even more for his death during cutting his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Since the virtue of man was superior to the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he lost hope in me, he returned to his land, and came back to me because of his eagerness, and he cut off his entire hand; yet he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not record this story except to be an aid regarding what happens in this condition, and as a sign that shows its significance and according to how it is acted upon.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	§ On the care of wounds, and the quality of enema with medicines.
Caput XC.	Head 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus, then it ruptures or perforates, and whatever is inside it from the pus comes out, leaving an empty place as if it were a cavity; and the skin above it becomes like a thin cloth that has been worn out: and it does not reach its ultimate stage in corruption, nor does it affect the mouth, or the nerves, or the ligaments. It deserves to be called a "sinus", and is not named a "fistula"; however, if the space of the abscess is prolonged until the corruption affects any of these members, then it is called a "fistula" or an ulceration.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is to cut off that skin completely as it is affected; and especially when it has become thin and like cloth, and you trust that because of its corruption, it does not adhere to the place.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If you hope that it will adhere to the skin and does not result in that final corruption from its completion, and if there is thickening of the skin with flesh, then take care of it with a clister, as it were, to consider towards the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	If it is large and pus is discharged from it, having a foul smell, then clisterize it with Egyptian medicine, which consists of equal parts of vinegar, oil, and zinyar, mix them together into a useable preparation, and boil over a fire until the medication turns red, and then it will thicken like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take what is necessary from it and dissolve it in water and honey, and clisterize the sinus with it, tighten its opening, and leave the medication inside for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression, do this for several days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you have clisteryzed it with ash water, if this medicine is not present to you, take ash from burned wood or ash from oak trees, and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then apply it, and clisteryze with it until you trust that the sinus is already cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient cannot endure either Egyptian medicine or ash water, then clisteryze it with a mixture of water and honey, to which some crushed zinyar has been added.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	It cleanses itself with a mixture of honey and wine, due to the property of honey to purify and wash away, and wine makes the skin adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	You do this several times, and trust that the corruption of the sinus is now gone: then cleanse yourself with whatever makes the flesh in it grow anew.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take from the ointment of dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rosy oil, and astringent wine: or cleanse yourself with certain medicines, and other unguents, whose properties I have written in the treatise on unguents.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice of the sinus is tight, through which a catheter for the enema cannot pass: then widen it with a sharp iron, or place in it a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it widens.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if the orifice is also wide, then close its lips with a suture: and allow it to hold the amount that goes into the enema without adding more.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly, if its orifice from which pus flows is elevated to the upper parts: then dry it in the lower part where it is located, so that the pus can flow out of it below: for when pus becomes constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part as you see fit, then try to prepare the member in such a way that the pus can drain from it easily according to what you have prepared.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to ensure nothing retains the pus inside completely: and take solid medicines that are placed on the wound, suitable for what you see.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And the cloth should be of such a size that it allows communication throughout the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then use scissors to cut directly into the sinus' opening, expanding it slightly more than the sinus orifice.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend another linen cloth with ointment, according to the size of the opening, and place it over the sinus opening at a distance, allowing the pus to drain out of it: and do not remove the large cloth unless after a few days once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	The one who is over the sinus opening, he is the one you move at every hour to allow what is collected in it from pus to drain out: and so that you know if what flows out of it is a lot or a little: digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And consider once again the place of the sinus itself, whether the lord of that part feels pain therein or not, and whether there is a gap there or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Therefore, if your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the material that emerges from the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is already attached or approaching attachment; then resolve it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you have resolved the wound, then change the cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	However, if a fine, slow-moving virus emerges from the sinus after a long space, then do not despair about its attachment, for healing is approaching, since there are people whose flesh takes time to heal in their wounds, and others who act against it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	However, if after many days a bad, undigested pus emerges from the sinus, then know that the sinus is not attached.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the attachment of the sinus is delayed, and its condition prolongs: then in the drying process of the remedies, let the physicians make them such that they have humidity in their substance and dryness in their power, as the ointment of dyafinicon when superfluitous addition is added to it from above.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the very last part of what is being cured, take the ointment of dyafinicon, and dissolve it in rose oil, and apply it again over it with equal old wine in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then he should be bound with it and use it himself.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does this similar action when you do not have a drying ointment at hand, using honey when you prepare it until it becomes thick enough for use.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense: mix them all together and sprinkle that over the honey while it is still on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then place a cloth over it and bind it on your chest, and wrap the honey that you have prepared, until it thickens; then sprinkle some powder on top of it, and place it back on the cloth, and secure it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when it is administered with the long Aristolochia and the roots of the celestial lily, and there is a lily; and flour of herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple or compounded, mix them, and sprinkle that over the honey I described; use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the condition of the sinuses persists and does not improve with this treatment, then know that there is corruption within it; or it has already made an impression on the bones, or on the hard parts of other members, or on the ligaments; in such a case, treat it with fistular care as mentioned above.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the care of panaritium and the treatment of a thumb with an attrited nail, and the addition of a cut on the finger, and amputation.
Caput XCI.	Head 101.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritium is an ulcer that occurs beneath the nail of the thumb or foot, and it may occur in other fingers as well.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When this condition is prolonged and its treatment neglected, and the ulcer becomes infected with heat, or it decays and pus is discharged until the root of the nail is corroded, and perhaps it destroys the whole finger, and sometimes the corruption reaches the bones, until a foul odour emanates from it; and then the tip of the digit widens, and its colour turns black.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When, therefore, you treat it as we have said in amputation, and your treatment does not heal it, then you should cut off with a knife the whole remaining portion that is left of the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the ulcer after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Cauterization is indeed very useful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is healthy, and the nail itself is also sound, and the protrusions of the nail already press upon the flesh inwardly and begin to pierce it and hurt it, then you should place a thin radium under the angle of the nail that presses upon the flesh, and push it upwards; and cut off the flesh with ease, and apply over it what remains of the medicine burning, corroding, until it is entirely removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that wound with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	However, if the corruption has already affected the mouth, then it is necessary to cut open that mouth and remove the diseased part: for it never heals as long as the corrupted bone remains within it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see that the corruption and decay are spreading to the finger, then cut it off at a joint, as has been mentioned for its proper treatment.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the diseased part until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	However, if there is an injury to the nail due to friction or impact, and it causes intense pain, then a phlebotomist should drain the blood from the affected part first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail using a sharp scalpel, cutting across from top to bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail, for you may cause additional pain to the already sensitive area, and this could lead to increased healing time for the tissue.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the area with something that soothes pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The true finger that is born into some hands of humans may be entirely fleshy, and sometimes there are bones within them, and perhaps there is a nail, and some are born at the joint or have their origin in some node of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, he who is born with certain finger knots does not move, and he who is born near the joint of the finger may perhaps move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, he who is among them (the parts of the body) is fleshy, his section (incision) is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is, as you cut into itself near its root with a wide scalpel.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the treatment of him whose birth is at the joint's root is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting into it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In him who is born in a finger near the last knot, then you must cut into the flesh first with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then, saw the bone with one of their saws suitable for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The consolidation that occurs in the fingers is often due to either birth (i.e., it is born with him) or from healing of a wound, or from fire burning, and similar causes.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary to cut away that consolidation until the digits return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a lining of cloth soaked in pink oil, so that they do not adhere too quickly, and separate them; or place between them a thin layer of lead, until the place is consolidated as necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if there is consolidation of certain digits with the palm, then dry that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	§ On the Incision of Deformities.
Caput XCII.	Head 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	These are the veins that are inflated, thick, filled with melancholic superfluities that occur in many parts of the body; and most notably their outflow is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk or work hard, and carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to administer purgation of the body from black cholera several times with strong purgative.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then the phlebotomist should draw blood from those veins of the patient.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these [veins] with iron is indeed according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they bleed, and the black blood is extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another way is that the vein is lifted up, and all of it is extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of it is indeed according to this manner.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	It crushes the limb first with hot water extensively, until the thick, foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then it ties the limb of the patient from the upper part of the thigh to the lower part of the knee with bandages.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then it cuts the vein in one, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then it lifts up, that is, extracts the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from above, it should be left to the phlebotomist to cut the limb at the first sign of bleeding.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the wound down below: until an amount of blood sufficient to stop the bleeding and endure the patient's strength is drained.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it: and instruct him to refrain from foods that produce black cholera: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when veins are filled and it hurts the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of a wound is carried out in this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	If there are many crusts on the wound, it should be carefully cleaned.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Next, insert the tip of the knife into the bath: either use a small incision in its leg with hot water, until it turns red and the veins bulge, or apply intense pressure if a hot bath is not available, until the limb is heated.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin with a clean cloth along the length of the vein, either at its last segment near the knee or at its lower part near the ankle.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then, using scissors, open the skin and scrape away the vein from all sides until it appears healthy; at this point, you will see it turn from red to dark purple.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When the vein is thus drained from the skin, you will see it turn white, resembling a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert the forceps under it and lift it until it is completely removed from the skin; hang it gently with a hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another section near that one with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then, scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then, lift it up with the radii as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then, dry another cut or several cuts, if necessary.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then, lift it up and make an incision on that last cut near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then, extract it towards the cut that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you have extracted it from the cut that is above, or from all the higher cuts, until, when it has come out entirely, then make an incision on it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If, however, it does not obey you in being extracted and lifted, then insert a sharp two-edged blade and tie it, and extract that very one; or insert under it a radium, and turn your hand to every part until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, so as not to be cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it should cut you, then it will be difficult to extract it at all, and it inflicts further harm on the weak part from which it comes.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	After you have completely removed it, place over the wound a cloth soaked in wine and rose oil, or simply oil, and tend to it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is twisted and has a kink which needs to be released towards certain parts, and it is not as we said, according to rectitude, then you need to find above it, towards every part of its twist, and the places where it needs to be released.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you have completely loosened it, and be careful near the cut not to injure or puncture the vein, for it will be difficult for you to raise or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, be careful.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of the incident which heals the vein.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of the vein's blindness.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not as hard as the other veins, nor does it have sharp ends that would puncture the vein; rather, it has great flexibility, being soft. If it were thin, it could puncture the vein with its thinness; on the contrary, its excessive thickness, as we said, should be avoided.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the thigh vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot regions on Earth, such as Alizegis and Arab lands, and in dry, hot lands with little tenderness, that is, where grass or trees do not grow.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed, its generation is from the decay that occurs beneath the skin, as happens within bodies of snakes and internal worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the onset of the course of this vein is what happens in a leg with severe inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the site is used.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to exit from that site of use, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When it appears from that end, then you must cover the whole fragment with lead, whose weight is a kilo (drachma keil), up to two kilo-drachmas, and make the knot on itself: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Therefore, whenever something comes out from that (wound), lead it back externally and clean that impurity.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends too much, then cut off that part and clean the remaining part.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it completely until it has come out entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and goes back into the flesh, causing an ulcer, putrefaction at the site, and a bad wound.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore, it should be treated gently and removed gradually until the last part comes out from that (wound) and nothing remains within the body; from this vein, indeed, comes out a certain amount in some men, equal to five palms and ten fingers in length.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, because a man has been released from two-and-twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	However, if it happens to you during your treatment time: then insert a knife into its wound and pierce it deeply with the body, until all that is within it of the matter comes out entirely; and administer to the site a treatment against putrefaction for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care with the cure of the ulcers.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein, indeed, when it has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot or in the foot itself, it has numerous openings, and a branch emerges from each opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, treat it as we said in the division, and with what has been mentioned above.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	§ On the section concerning worms generated beneath the skin, and it is said to be a "boil.
Caput XCIIII.	Head 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This boil is called a "boil" in some lands among us, because it often happens to cattle, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it moves throughout the body, ascending and descending, and is visible to the sense when it moves from one part of the body to another until it ruptures wherever it ruptures on the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the decay of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes, that is, roundworms (lumbrici) and tapeworms (ascarides), occur in the intestines.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared from his evil intent.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when he (the foreign body) enters the body and is carried to the head, and reaches the place, then perhaps it opens within him and comes out, and destroys the eye, and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore one wants to cure it and extract it, then that is not done except during its movement, and the appearance of itself to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to tie what is above it and what is beneath it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry it above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is deep in the flesh and you cannot find it, then place a hot cauterization on the place until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And moreover, what is feared, is its corruption, how it corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If, however, you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then tighten a good ligature beneath it.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry it above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines that dissolve bad, putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he should beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	§ On the division of disease, Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called Nakir in our land; it is a pain that occurs in certain members, then it changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I have indeed seen it myself, according to what I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I have been called to see a sick woman in certain parts.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she withdrew her arm, and I saw a little swelling in the vein at the wrist of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after having waited for an hour, I saw one swelling move with a thin thread, as the flesh does, rising towards her shoulder more quickly than it can be said; so that it looks like living silver, when it runs from one place to another.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore, the pain retreated from that place and became fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then, at the passing of an hour, it (the pain) grew weaker and moved into the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it was spreading throughout his entire body, as I could see.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed, therefore, at the speed with which it (the pain) shifted from one part of the body to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I had indeed never before seen this pain with my own eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who experience the pain shifting from one part of the body to another; and they do not see it with their eyes as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it (the pain) would be as it is, unless it were because she was a woman of those who have veins detected in this way; from here, therefore, appears to the senses that mobility has changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that it does not appear in this way to those who are delicate and have moist bodies, secret veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	If therefore you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain, then if it appears clearly to your eye, as we said, then tighten over it, and under it quickly; and dry it above it until that flux is stopped up; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	However, if you do not see it with your eyes, then care for it with the discharge of the body, and with what it expels vapors, and purges them with foul pills, and pills of myrrh, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	**On the Extraction of Arrows**
Caput XCVI.	Head XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their kinds and according to the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	The diversity of these is indeed great, for some have large barbs and others none; some are sharp, and others dull.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them there are some that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And from those that have tongues (arrows).
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And from those that have stars (arrowheads).
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	The injuries that occur in the members themselves are of two kinds.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For these members are derived from the main parts, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestine, bladder, and similar organs.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When one of these members fails and shows signs of death, as I will tell you later, then it is necessary that you swiftly extract the arrow from them, for death follows where it is located, in many ways.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these signs of evil do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deeply within the member, then extract it and tend to the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	The signs of the brain, when a arrow falls into it and penetrates through the bone, and enters from above the brain, are: for there occur sudden fainting, darkness, giddiness, red eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of the mind, and cholera-like vomiting.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may exit through the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And from the wound's location, white fluid similar to pus issues.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And so it exits from that similar moisture of the flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not emerge.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left mammary gland; and it feels as if it were itself fixed in a hard substance, not in something vacuous.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse; and blood flows from the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it follows that extreme coldness, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death descends without a doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of the arrow when it strikes the lung is the flow of foamy blood from the wound; and the symptoms that follow are a stiff neck, fever, and a change in color to pale.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And the great, deep breath departs; and it seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into a part of the chest, that is near the ribs, then it is as if it touches the little bones; and it causes great anxiety with a sharp pain, with a breathless sigh, and all the arms tremble.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will issue forth from the wound due to the food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow enters the abdomen and becomes lodged there: something of feces will issue forth from the wound, or a bruise, or the intestines which have already been ruptured.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine issues forth from it: something proceeds from it to the outside, and a stronger pain occurs in the patient; then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The other parts of the body, such as the face, neck, throat, palms, elbow, back bones, furca (hip bone), thigh, leg and similar parts from the limbs are salutary according to many dispositions; when the arrow does not hit an artery or a nerve, and is not a venomous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I have seen these arrows to be such, so that you may know through this regarding your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is, because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I extracted it from his other side, beneath the fat of his ear, and he was healed, without any harm to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which had penetrated his eye fat under his lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I could not extract it from there except for a small part of its shaft, with which it was attached to its wood; and it was a large arrow among the arrows of the Turkish bow, with soft iron, without points.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was thus healed, and no harm occurred to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabian arrow, and it had points.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I then followed it up between the two ribs, and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was thus puzzled with it, until I extracted it; and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the man, which had penetrated his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed, nothing changed over him from his dispositions regarding the arrow; nor was there any further complication, and he recovered, and no ill accident befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And he saw a man to whom an arrow had pierced his back, and the wound over it had healed.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After which, after seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And he saw a woman to whom an arrow had pierced her belly; the wound over it healed, and the arrow remained inside; and nothing changed from his dispositions regarding her, and the woman did not experience any harm from any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And he saw another man to whom an arrow had pierced his face; the wound healed and remained, causing him little pain; and similar cases were many.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted the arrow from a man who had been struck in the middle of his nose, and it was already declining to the right side a little; and the arrow was entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called to his care after the arrow's wound for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I therefore find the wound of the arrow very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	Therefore I examined it with a delicate probe, and found no sensation; he, however, perceived the puncture and pain beneath his gold ring on the right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that it was the puncture from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore applied a poultice to the place, which had an attractive and softening power, confident that it would heal and reveal to me the sign of the arrow, so that I could cut it off; but no such accident occurred at the site, indicating that the arrow had not struck deep.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I therefore applied the poultice to it for many days; and no accident occurred, and the wound became consolidated in time; but it remained weak from extraction for a space of days, until he felt the arrow enter his nose on a certain day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I then applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to it for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it with a probe, I felt the fine tip of the arrow that was adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound that corrosive medicine until we could see the tip of the arrow; and it passed by me with that space of time approximately four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, it did not yield to extraction, so I did not cease to work delicately over it and ingeniously with methods of ingenuity until I began on it one day with well-made forceps, in accordance with which their shape would come to an end at the conclusion of this chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I healed the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed, the doctors judge that the nose cartilage does not heal.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	So I healed it, and the wound became consolidated, and it was cured completely healthy; nothing at all harmed it.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you about the quality of extracting certain arrows, so that you may apply that rule and meaning to what I have not mentioned.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and the distinctions between them are not comprehended within the narration; nor does the book understand it, and a prudent artisan compares with little to much, and finds the operation new, and a new instrument among the descents of external matters of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, therefore, that arrows do not come out of the members in which they are fixed, unless according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	It entered through attraction from the place it came from inside.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or on the contrary, of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding into the flesh: it is attracted and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not obey to come out from the time when it fell, then you need to let go of it for several days until the flesh around it putrefies: and its attraction will be released, and its coming out.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly, if it is lodged in a bone and does not obey you to come out, then let go of it for several days, and repeat the process of attraction and motion every day until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you to come out after several days, then you need to drill around the arrow in the bone from every side with a thin knife, until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the skull's bone and has already proceeded into one of the brain's vessels, and symptoms of some of the conditions I mentioned appear, then refrain from attracting the arrow and let it be, until it becomes calm after several days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	If an arrow penetrates the skin, then death is not prolonged by it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except only in a bone of the body, and does not penetrate to the skin: then the patient remains weak for several days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents; then the minds must be turned to the attraction of the arrow and its extraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	However, if it is fixed firmly and does not obey you to attract: then apply a heat around the arrow, like a hot plate; afterward, care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow is already absorbed in the body's place, and it is hidden and concealed from the senses: then seek it with attempts.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If, however, you feel it, then attract it with certain instruments that are suited to its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you cannot overcome it because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in deep places; and there is no bone, or nerve, or vein there: then find a place above it, until the wound becomes enlarged, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	Which if there are others to hold, then free the flesh fixed in them from every part, with all the means and devices you can, until it becomes loose or twisted.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is located, then use a twisting of your hand, with shears to all parts, until you make it gush out; and the subtlest last, with subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it and extract it.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot remove it at once, then leave it for a few days until what is around it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the process: it will indeed be cured then if contrary to you the flow of blood persists; then administer what we said from treatment in its chapter: and guard your virtue from vein, nerve, or chord cutting.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer wit in every way possible to evacuate the arrow: and let that be with ease, or calmness, or slowness, or firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that when you draw out the arrow, make it weak according to its figure, as it was near the case of the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more convenient.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If, however, it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	However, the arrow which emerges from the opposite part or has already proceeded from it to the outside: it causes a bulge at the tip of the arrow through sensation from the upper part of the adjacent skin, and you will see it protruding. So dry it above and let the section be according to the amount that the forceps grasp in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it, for it becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is indeed held in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness until the arrow presses against the bone and increases its own size: then pull it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let it go for several days, then repeat the process until it emerges.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If there is wood in the arrow, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If, however, the wood falls off and you wish to apply a push: then insert a sharp instrument into it so that its pointedness goes into the tail of the arrow: then push it with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If, however, the arrow is pointed, then push it with the instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The arrow should be freed through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If an arrow has lodged in the flesh, it is necessary to remove all the flesh around it if you can do so.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it as it relates to that arrow.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow falls into the chest, or stomach, or limb, and is close to where you can touch it with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut over it, then cut and cauterize the wound from the vein or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then dress the wound, if you see one, and take care of it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of pincers, by which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The ends of these pincers should resemble the shape of an ear, made as if from iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not let go of it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many types of them, large and small, and medium and fine, according to the size of the arrow, and the depth of the wound, and its breadth, and the tightness of it.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the driver is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the impelling drum.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the extreme of the drum, such as the radius, to allow its entrance into the concave arrow, and it is impelled with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The impelling extremity of this concave is concave like the wing of a bird, so that the entrance of the arrow into it is allowed and its impulse.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	**On phlebotomy of veins.**

The true phlebotomy of the two veins near the ear is indicated for chronic catarrh, hemigranae (half-headache), old skin ulcers, and other ancient head conditions.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the phlebotomy depends on what I have described.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is done by purging the head from below: and the nape of the neck is rubbed at the location of the two veins with a rough cloth using proper friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then he strains his weakened neck with a twist, until two veins become visible.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And the locations of these are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore, seek them out with your finger, and where you feel the pulsation of these veins beneath your finger, mark them with cautery.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take the phlebotomist's knife, which is called the "Incidens.

Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then open the lower incision, and bind it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a scalpel on the side.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary for the scalpel to have a sharp point as in other scalpels; on the contrary, it should have a broad edge.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And the scalpel should be placed on it according to its thickness, since the wound is close, and perhaps the scalpel might break when it is too thin.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	§ On the phlebotomy of veins in two places (lacrimal bones).

Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	If the scalpel is too thin, it might break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then make it flow from blood as much as is necessary for you.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And place a bandage over them, and bind them tightly at night, and loosen them in the morning.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	§ On the phlebotomy of nasal veins.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	The phlebotomy of nasal veins refers to the treatment for acute fever, a violent headache, and facial pains, such as hemicranias, and the redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is chronic.

Then hold the nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long phlebotomy instrument; fix it in the middle of the nose, between what distinguishes the nose according to its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Since the vein does not appear there to the eye, and since the blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And you must, while holding the phlebotomy instrument with your last hand, let the blood flow as much as is necessary for you.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then bind it tightly at night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	It is indeed quickly restored.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	**On the venesection of arteries (from Guide's manual)**

In Guide's manual, the true principle of venesection is to constrict the flow of blood, prevent the onset of leprosy, alleviate melancholy, treat impetigo and bad ulcers, and counteract corrosive (i.e., worm) infections.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	And the quality of this venesection is that it constricts the patient under both sides of his neck with a ligature; and the surgeon should stand over the patient's head, while the patient sits on a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	Then the surgeon should make the venesection vein longer for a broader cut.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	Then extract a moderately tempered amount of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for that.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then do the same for the other vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Then release the ligature and tie the two veins with a medium tightness so as not to cause further harm to the patient.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And leave it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	The wound is healed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On the bleeding of veins, Albucasis.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	According to Albucasis, the indication for phlebotomy of veins is when there is a buildup of blood in the mouth, leading to gum corruption, bad ulcers, and cracks in the lips and mouth, as well as those found in the nose and its surroundings.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that you make the patient sit before you and tighten their neck with a strap.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then you open the patient's lips and look at two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the second on the left, and their demonstration is through the darkening of the colors.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And the truth is that around them there are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, make an incision on each with a cutting instrument.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If, however, there is doubt about which one it is and you do not know, then turn your attention to the larger incision and those that are more apparent.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly, do the same with the two veins that are in the upper lip, and indeed custom usually follows this, and make incisions on the two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	On phlebotomy of the vein beneath the tongue after cephalic phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The true method of phlebotomy concerning the two veins beneath the tongue: It is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein should be performed for conditions in the throat, and for ailments of the uvula and disorders of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of performing phlebotomy is such that the patient should sit between your hands facing the sun; and raise his tongue, and look beneath his tongue at one vein from the side, and another vein from the other side; and the color of each should turn to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Perform phlebotomy on both veins; and be careful not to use your last hand on the phlebotomy.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For beneath them are arteries, and perhaps there may be a flow of blood from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins in the forearm.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins that are phlebotomized in the forearm—of these, phlebotomy of one is customary for all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	Phlebotomy of these should be performed according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	By piercing with a myrtle-handled phlebotom; or by pressing with an olive-shaped instrument to achieve greater fluency; or by cutting with a surgical knife, it is called alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus is alnesil what pertains to incision.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these there arise various broad and narrow kinds according to the width and tightness of the veins. The form of the myrtle phlebotom is wide as you can see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is used to open veins that are concave, full, swollen, visible, thick, and those that contain thick, cloudy blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotom is of smaller width and more delicate extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the delicate phlebotomy of veins containing thin, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	**On phlebotomy of the basil (vein)**
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	However, the basil (vein), which is one of these three veins, provides the greatest facility for phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because he extracts blood from ailments that are under the throat and neck, following the chest and vein; and it is befitting for the phlebotomist to use a phlebotomy tool on it, as a precaution, and be above the fear of it, since there is an artery beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If, therefore, he errs and adds to the puncture of phlebotomy, he will hit that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, it is necessary not to use a phlebotomy tool on it with a cutting phlebotomist; instead, it should be cut with an aluminium (or similar) instrument.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If it does not appear with a clear sign, then it is necessary to find others for it, and exchange it for another, or seek some branch of it; or apply a phlebotomy tool at the place of its position in the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	Indeed, it is clear, and cut it with an aluminium phlebotomist, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	However, if you wish to perform phlebotomy on the same site, then it is necessary before tightening the arm, to touch the place, until you know the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with wax, afterwards tighten the arm, and cut the vein with a concave phlebotomist (as we said).
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And so that the blow does not fall through the space from the location of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, as you tighten the ligament, an inflation at the place you indicated with wax, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery; therefore, release it gently.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood rising during phlebotomy like urine from a boy, and it is thin, red blood, then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then proceed, and place your finger on the long space above, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore blood is severed (it is often severed many times), then tighten the limb and release it; and let the patient be careful from its motion; and it should be over his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for several days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	However, if the blood does not sever and it constricts you, and you do not have a remedy at hand, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	Because its extremities are constricted, and the blood is severed.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Take and accept the leather of the fistula, and find its middle part; take one half and tighten it over the vein with a ligature and small stitches until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood separates, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of itself with that whose remembrance preceded the flow of blood from the place of the stitches; and the separation of the blood from it is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound's location and the possibility of binding it from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	§ On the phlebotomy of the dark vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The dark veins, however, require a certain force for phlebotomy, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; this is because it is composed of branches of the Basilic and Cephalic veins, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it happens that the phlebotomist should be careful because there is a nerve under it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the puncture of phlebotomy and finds a nerve, there is a loss of sensation, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it does not heal completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears to the sense many times.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If it is hidden in certain men and is subtle, and not shown, then you should put your phlebotomy where it passes through them, the incision with the alnessil, and the detachment of the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	**On the Cephalic Vein**
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and conveys it to the eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And for this vein, if you wish, you should puncture it with a phlebotomizer made of olive or myrrh, because it is the healthiest of all veins, as it is neither beneath an artery nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, when you perform phlebotomy, it is necessary to remove the head of the vein only with a phlebotomizer, and look for a softer place, and it does not harm him if it is not found with the first strike, but it should be passed over it several times with phlebotomy.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps it will be displaced in some men when not phlebotomized in the first strike, but it does not harm him that displacement in some way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	¶ On the usefulness of phlebotomy and precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	However, the quality of phlebotomy and its potential complications depend on careful consideration of the procedure's correct execution.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, it is essential to understand that phlebotomy should only be administered for the purpose of preserving health, and to continue doing so with caution to prevent illness from arising or worsening.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And phlebotomy should be performed on one of the three veins found in the arm, namely the cephalic, the femoral, or the basilic vein.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And to perform phlebotomy at the beginning of spring after fasting, on the veins located above the wrists, and in summer and winter after meals when there is a sign of overfullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And phlebotomy should be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed since the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy performed to treat illness does not have a specific time; but when circumstances and necessity dictate, it can be done at night or during the day, and at any hour or time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary for children under the age of fourteen to undergo phlebotomy until their veins become stronger.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	A pregnant woman should not have blood let from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the elderly, who have already passed sixty years, be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	So if anyone wishes to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before bloodletting with a gentle enema, if much feces is retained in them; so that the veins do not draw from the intestines an excess of putrid fluid harmful to the main members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	A patient should not be bled when they are exhausted from nausea, nor constipated or too drunk until that condition is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should an invalid with edema be bled.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let bloodletting be avoided again after a stomachache, vomiting, flow of the bowels, multiplication of coitus, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything else that weakens strength from the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick due to food, drink, and medicine; then it is possible for him to do that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he should take a bath, if nothing prohibits it; or exercise some kind of exercise to thin the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And moreover, perform his phlebotomy about the third hour of the day, as we have said, and try to cause his chest to be drained on that day from all animal misfortunes, such as distress, anger, fear; and from all bodily misfortunes, such as labor, pain, excess, and similar ones.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make his condition present with those things of which usage is a custom among men, from aromatics and perfumery, and rejoicing, and similar ones, according to the possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the phlebotomist should sit on a bench higher than that of the patient; then he should draw his arm and rub it with the phlebotomist's hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should tighten the ligature with the thong and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And the ligature should be firm, but not excessive, for when a ligature is uneven or there is too much tension in the ligature, it hinders the flow of blood; and similarly, when it is too loose, it also hinders the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	After the ligature, he should then have the patient rub his hands gently back and forth until the veins swell and become visible to the touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist should cleanse the wound with a little oil, traditionally used for this purpose.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his index finger of the left hand over the vein itself at the site where he intends to perform phlebotomy, lightly: so that the vein does not escape and is crushed.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Since veins are like a cord that escapes during phlebotomy and some are full of swift blood flow; and when you place the phlebotomist over them, they contract beneath the phlebotomist and the phlebotomist is deceived, not opening the vein; and if he does open it, it is too tight. For this reason, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should remove the phlebotomist.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If the vein opens on its own from the first attempt, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it another time at the same place lightly, or above it with haste; if the place does not heal.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If the place heals or becomes weak, then release it on the day or after two days; and do not tie the ligature tightly.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed the healing place attracts heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should a bath be taken.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	He then practices phlebotomy if he loves it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small or the blood flows gently, and you fear that too much blood might be lost, then repeat the phlebotomy in the same wound according to the right direction, and add only a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it quickly before the place is healed; for once the place is healed, it is a problem in many cases.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see that the place is already healed, then do not repeat over it at all; for it does not allow you to achieve anything.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place nothing on it from the fat of oil, for it eases the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better at this place than pure oil, and than all the rest of the oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly, apply the fat of oil to every vein that you phlebotomize where there is a need to stop the flow of blood; and make it into a paste with flour and honey when applied to the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If a great abscess occurs at the site of phlebotomy, which happens frequently, especially to those who have not been bled properly, or if there is only a small opening in the vein, then apply and place over the area a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly, and squeeze it firmly immediately, as it will be relieved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do that after the blood has exited from the vein itself with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If after a few days there remains in the site some blackness or redness, it does not harm it; and if you wish, place over it something of aloe or myrrh dissolved, or something from the juice of mint, that is, warmth or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And indeed, abscesses and swellings often occur during phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand over it, and if you feel softness at the time of your compression over it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, put something over it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood may flow from that artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make an embolism for it with what has constriction, so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you extract blood from every man according to the amount of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that appears from the color rising above the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it turns red; and likewise, if you see it thick, then let it flow until it thins; and similarly, if it is acute, then remove its sharpness until it becomes smooth.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And he who is full, strong, and needs the extraction of blood at once, must have the vein amplified and be bled on the side, and conversely, for him who is weak.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract the wound in vessels and make a tight opening; and better yet is that which is administered in vein phlebotomy, so that there is a transverse cut, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this mode of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and from cutting a nerve; and it is more commendable and healthier than phlebotomy through width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And he who is accustomed to reach the point of phlebotomy with syncope, must give him a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice before phlebotomy, or warm water if he is heated; and extract blood from him in three or four places.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	If there is a chill in the complexion, then he should take bread soaked in thin syrup, or in syrup of honey perfumed with spices, or in perfumed aromatic syrup before phlebotomy.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If, during phlebotomy, a fainting spell occurs due to excessive blood loss, then one should take a drink of meat broth and thin aromatic syrup; they should use spices with the patient's chest and rest it; and employ the remedies mentioned in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to restore their arm and resolve their blood issues, if phlebotomy is required due to excessive evacuation and the patient's strength is weak, they should gradually dissolve their blood over several days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Indeed, whoever wishes to restore their arm and resolve their blood issues, but their body is strong, should do the following after seven or nine hours—or when it has been longer since their first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from their body towards the opposite part from where it is declining, should do so on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In cases where a person's body has too much already heated and aggravated blood, causing fever, it is necessary to draw out a significant amount of blood at once; and widen the opening until syncope occurs; after having preserved all conditions of phlebotomy; and place your hand over the pulse near the flow of blood, so as not to cause death in that spot.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Many times this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and it falls due to negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you intend to open the arm and second to let blood, while the opening of the vein is already closed, and it becomes difficult for the blood to flow out, as it is hurriedly superimposed on itself with impetuosity, and the wound quickly extends.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a great evil, leave it alone for now, until it is bled a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with care the coagulated blood from the opening of the vein, and place over it some dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place over it some of the alum or sage, and apply gentle compression until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein has already burst, then leave it, and do not press it, until the hematoma is seated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If it is necessary to open the vein a second time and there is no excuse, then either bleed it again over that place, or on another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The phlebotomy arm, however, at the place of the vein Fusca and Basilica, if they are not found and are hidden, since they are composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that the patient introduces his hand into warm water until the blade becomes red and the vein is clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is tied over it with a thin ligature with moderate tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the phlebotomy is made according to the transverse direction gradually, not longitudinally or laterally, and your opening should be wide enough for the phlebotomy to be performed over the joint of the hand slightly.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the flow of blood is obstructed, then repeat immersing your hand in warm water and allow the blood to flow into the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	However, if it is the summer season, then excuse yourself from immersing your hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And certainly the most blood flow occurs in warm water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And this vein's phlebotomy is the healthiest for all veins, because it is not pulsating under it nor is there a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The phlebotomy of the left hand's Vein Saluatella is beneficial for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that you tighten the vein with your hand and ligature, or with your own hand, after you have inserted it into warm water, until the vein is bent and its sensation becomes very pronounced.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then perform the phlebotomy by passing it through.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely through, it will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to use the phlebotomy tool too roughly.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the naked nerves of the fingers, exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return your hand to the warm water and allow the blood to flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the vein's opening and be stopped from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	So when you have withdrawn the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on top of the vein, so that it does not clot quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise, it is necessary that you do this with every branch tightly bound.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The true method of phlebotomy with the left hand is as follows: since it is directed towards the spleen's afflictions, do likewise in this phlebotomy as you did in the second equal manner.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The method for saphenous phlebotomy, however, is for ailments located in the lower part of the body, such as maladies of the matrix (uterine issues), retention of menses, kidney problems, old ulcers of the coxa and crura, and similar conditions from these ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that the patient immerses his afflicted foot in warm water, and makes friction over it until the veins burst, and ties above the joint of the foot with bindings.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed, the veins are located near the calcaneum (heel bone), visible towards the thumb, and they branch out from it on the face of the foot with many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, perform phlebotomy on it at the broader branch or near the calcaneum where it joins together, since this is better and healthier.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	Which if performing phlebotomy on it on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are under it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And do not perform your phlebotomy through it as if you want to cut it, and let the phlebotomy be neat (precise).
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If, however, the escape of blood is forbidden, then repeat the procedure by immersing the foot in hot water and allow the blood to flow into it until it is cleared.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If, however, the phlebotomist mistakes the vein in the first attempt, they should repeat the procedure higher up slightly, for that place is safe and there will be no harm from it when you seek relief from nerves, as we said before.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And likewise with the saphenous vein of the other foot.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The sciatic vein, as we said, is located at the side of the calf near the ankle.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the manner of phlebotomy for it is, to ease the pain of the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is that the patient should enter a warm bath and hurry: and grasp the foot with four fingers on the side of the ankle up to above the calcaneum, using a thin, long blade, for it is not visible otherwise.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then perform the phlebotomy as best you can, either directly or according to the turn of the vein; and it is better, whether by making a cut with a blade or by slicing it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For indeed it is a healthier place, and it is hidden from many men.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it or it does not appear at all to the senses, then take a branch of it, which appears on the back of the foot and towards the ear, and cauterize from the nerves, causing blood to flow out in quantity as desired.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the stricture (bandage) and place over the site of the phlebotomy (bloodletting) a piece of skin, and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	Indeed, it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	**On Drainage (Ventilation) and the Nature of its Use**
Caput XCVIII.	Head 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Tents (wounds) are formed from horns, air, and other (foreign) bodies.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And Drainage (Ventilation) is performed according to two methods.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When performing scraping and extraction of blood; and another is ventilation without scraping.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventilation which is without scraping (or incision) is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	For indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	For indeed it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the places where vapors are applied with cutting and extraction of blood are fourteen locations of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the venting of the alnocratis, which is last on the head; and alkhel, which is in the middle of the neck; and the venting of the Alhagdahim, which are two layers on the neck from both sides; and the venting of the mind, which is under the jaw in the lower mouth; and the venting of the two spatulas; and the venting of the Alachosos, which is at the very end of the tail; and the venting of the two forks, which are in the middle of both arms; and the venting of the two tendons; and the venting of the two caves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed, venting does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that, the strength does not leave them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary to apply venting or with fire, or without fire, in any illness that results from fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If need arises from illness to apply venting, or because of custom, we administer it at every hour at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	Which is because there are people who, when much blood accumulates in them, until it needs to be extracted through incision, find swelling and hardness in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from them, some find swelling and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from them, some experience itching on their face and forehead, darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from them, some scratch the area of their incision.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from them, some experience their laughter increasing.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from them, some find the taste of blood in their mouth; or they might retch and spit out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from them, some experience prolonged sleep.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from them, some see blood and redness in their sleep, wounds, and things similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we therefore see something from these signs, and particularly if it occurs in the third medium of the month: we then order the incision to be made, after two or three hours have passed since sunset.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The treatment of venting the nape (of the neck) is as follows: since it conveys weight to the head and what drains towards the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	It is necessary at this point, so that it (the treatment) may be effective after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this, indeed, is the place for phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permissible to use it (the treatment) on one with a cold complexion or congestion.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it causes great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of this, it is not permissible to use (the treatment) on the elderly or those with cold-related ailments in their heads.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	However, if one insists on doing it (the treatment), oblivion will befall him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of this, you should urge the ventosator to rest his hand with a gentle flow towards the lower parts, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventilation or alkehel is the place for the phlebotomy of the dusky (type of blood) and basic (phlebotomy), and because of this, it brings about asthma, constriction of the breath, cracking of the instrument, coughing, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the ventosa (suction cup) be applied to Alkehel's wound momentarily, for if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The use of the ventosa indeed provides relief from localized pain in the head, eyes, half-headache (hemigranae), perforation, and tooth root pain, and it takes the place of bloodletting with a leech.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you warn the ventosa user not to use his hand for scraping too forcefully, so as not to cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	However, the use of the ventosa under the chin provides relief from alcohol in the mouth, decay of the gums, and similar conditions that affect the mouth, and it replaces other bloodletting methods on the lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	However, the use of ventosas in the form of spoons provides relief from arthritis, which is caused by stiffness and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The use of ventosas on the internal parts of two bell-shaped cups provides assistance to bloodletting from three veins: the basilic, the fusca (dark vein), and the cephalic, because these ventosas draw blood from all those small veins in the flesh, and the smaller veins draw blood from the others until it reaches the three main veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you warn the surgeon not to go too deep into the scarification, for the site is denuded of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	However, the ventosa that is sucked over the anus helps with hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the surgeon that the ventosa should be strong and made of air, for the site needs a strong suction, and the delicate vents might break, so a deep scarification is required.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	However, the vents of the veins diminish their size visibly, for they draw blood from throughout the body, and bring relief to old pains in the kidneys, bladder, and gonads; they induce menstruation, relieve pain, and take the place of phlebotomy on two saphenous veins and varicose veins.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the aid of varicose veins is near to the aid of the two crusts' vents.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the vents is that you place the ventosa first in a hollow place and apply a moderate suction; do not prolong the position of the vents, but remove them quickly, and move them quickly so that the humors reach the site with an equal flow; do not keep repeating this process and continuing until you see the site turning red and swollen, and appears to be blood-red: then scarify and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those who have tender flesh, rare hair, it is necessary to perform the incision only once, not repeatedly, so as not to ulcerate the site.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And especially the windbagger, to amplify the incision, and make it deeper slightly; and regulate the suction for ease, speed, and his own motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is great thickness of blood, then it is necessary to perform the incision twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance, the path to thinning the blood and improving its flow is opened; and in the second, the precise examination for the meticulous extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is indeed very foul, then a third incision should be made; to achieve the ultimate result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually or in small amounts, a single incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	Which if we wish to extract much blood, we perform many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary to make a deep incision; and the depth of the skin should be equal to the depth of the incision.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which needs to be administered from oils at the site of the windpipes, and what should be avoided when using them?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In the case of skin that is thick, hard, and dark, with tight pores, it is necessary to apply the windpipe areas with open oils, such as lard, vegetable oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is during the winter season, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or snowball (satina) oil, and similar oils.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If indeed there is excessive thick, cold moisture, then amber oil, or balsam oil, or white oil, or anise oil, and similar oils should be used.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If indeed it is necessary to open wide the pores of tender flesh, then it should be prohibited from oil, and after ventilation, these windpipe areas should be washed with rosewater, or cold water, or warm water, or pumpkin seed water, or water from portulaca, and similar substances.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is excessively moist should wash the windpipes with vinegar or myrtle water and sumac, and similar substances.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	He should wash away their excess with old wine, or with pure water, or with anise or chamomile decoction, and similar substances.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that ventilation be taken care of in the bath or in the bathing area; indeed, it is necessary to administer [a treatment] after leaving the bath, for an hour or two.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary for anyone to sleep after ventilation.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	§ What is it that is necessary to regulate ventilation or phlebotomy before ventilation?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, you should consider primarily: if the one who is ventilated or bled is choleric, and acuteness and inflammation are present in his blood: then he should take cooling substances, such as the juice of a grenadine; and also throughout the day with vinegar and lettuce, and dry herbs, and fennel: and similar ones.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And remove his food cravings for fat, and meat that is easily digested, and prepared foods with herbs: and similar ones.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And for those whose condition is cold, it is necessary to take syrup in a drink of honey, or from almonds, or from fennel seeds made; and to consume medium perfumed wine, which is between old and new: and he should be instructed to limit his food intake.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And remove his food and drink, and any vomit; and birds, that is, small birds; and the chicks of pigeons should be left.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of cleansing and bloodletting be more than the food; and it is necessary to give in the drink for certain men in the hours of the tyro's ale, or a remedy from moss, that is, mace, or assafoetida before cleansing, or after: so that the principal members be strengthened, and the blood be thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary for them to take it in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	**On Wind (Pneumonia) without Scarification:**
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, the wind (pneumonia) that is without scarification affects the upper part of the epigastrium, and the spleen, and the podagra, and over the abdominal wall, and the navel, and the kidney locations, and the anchial pixels: for these members do not suffer scarification on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through them unless there is an attraction from a member of blood to another member; as we place pneumonia over the nipples in the illness of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to resolve the cold wind that has entered from one member to another; as we place a wind over the abdominal wall and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	Indeed, it rarefies the member and warms it up, and thus drives away pain because it resolves that fluidity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys when there is a congestion or stone in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	By its powerful attraction, it may perhaps open up the congestion or even dislodge the stone from its position.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly, when placed over the spleen, it does the same, draining the blood from both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	These wind passages are managed solely with incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are managed with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with warm water in cases of pleurisy: and that is to fill the wind passage, making it large, with only hot water, or water in which herbs that are suitable are boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	**Form of administering the wind passage with fire.**
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	It is the size of an opening between two fingers, shaped as we form it; its depth is halfway through the palm; and there is a small hole on its side, approximately in the middle, large enough for an awl to pass through: it should be made of iron or brass, smooth and flat, not damaging the member when placed above it; and in the center, there is a crossbar passing through it, made of iron or steel, where a candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this becomes a great and swift flux, greater than we have described, and somewhat less according to the sickness and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the winds of boys and those who are emaciated are different from the winds of men and of fat bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of applying this swift wind to a member over fire is such as kindling a nice flame with fire from linen or a small candle: and place it over the middle of the transverse staff that is in the center of the wind. So that the fire is ignited around the lower part of the wind, so as not to burn the weak body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed over the member: and the finger is on the hole that I mentioned, until we hold the wind; when we no longer need it, we remove the finger, and vapor will exit through that hole, and the wind will be immediately dissolved.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then apply fire according to its mode, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the case of the wind given for the disease of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse staff or hole: and it is not applied unless it is filled with water, and is placed only over the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this suction cup is better the larger it is, as it can absorb more water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	**On the Suspension of Blood Sugar**
Caput XCIX.	**Head 98**
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood sugars should not be applied to many parts of the body unless there is no possibility of placing vents there due to their weakness, such as on the lips, gums, and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a bare member without flesh, such as a finger, nose, or similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of their use is as follows: as you come from blood sugars that are in sweet waters, clean from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	They should then be left in sweet water during the day and night until they are hungry and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is drained first with phlebotomy and then with vents.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the infected member is washed until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then they should be placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are thus inserted and fall, and it is possible to suck out the place with a powerful flow, then it is more extreme in the cure; and if not, then withdraw the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, it is rubbed and pressed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood continues after the operation and there is oozing, then immerse a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the oozing stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the amount of blood is excessive, then sprinkle over it a powder of crushed skin or gallstones and similar things from hemostatic agents until the blood stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they can place on the area half-crushed bark, and leave it until the beans adhere to the site, as the blood stops.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if a repetition of the operation is required, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the hemostats cannot be suspended, then the place with fresh blood should be cleansed.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fix the bandage on the sites until something from the blood oozes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	They are then placed, for they adhere immediately when they sense something from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore the roots begin to fall off, apply something from an aloes plant that has been crushed, or salt, or ash; and they immediately fall off.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	**Section II. Conclusion.**
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	**Albucasis' Surgical Textbook, Part III.**
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	**General discourse on restoration, dislocation, treatment of twists, and similar conditions.**
Caput I.	**Chapter I.**
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, as it deals with the restoration of broken bones and the treatment of dislocations caused by accidents.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, for many fools throw themselves from this Chapter, as well as those who are troubled and have not ever looked at the ancient book nor read any letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is exclusive to the sciences on our earth.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never found it at all beneficial in that regard, and I have not acquired from it what I have acquired only because of the length of studying ancient books, and my study above and beyond understanding them, until I extracted his science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experience and study through the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have now described to you from that in this chapter all that contains my knowledge: and beyond my experiment, after I shortened it for you, and freed it from the occupation of length, and abbreviated it to the end of abbreviation, and showed it to the end of declination: and I formed many forms in it from the forms of instruments used in it, with addition and declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In conclusion, and collections from the fractures of bones, of those that must be considered before we begin the remembrance of fractured limbs, and various ones, if any one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	In the prologue to this chapter, we must say the main points of the discussion and chapters, to which the thoughtful practitioner is required to attend in order to reach the truth about them: that you and those eager may know, or learn, this noble art, and others through you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when someone suffers a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or any of these conditions, then it is necessary to address the immediate needs first, whether that involves bleeding him (phlebotomy) and treating the wound itself, or both at once; if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of strength, or if it is a young child, or an elderly person who is weak, or during a sudden heat wave, or a severe cold snap.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be satisfied with his food, cold odors, and lean meats, and avoid wine, fat meats, and overindulgence in any foods or meals that fill the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until he is safe from the heat and no longer suffers from the discharge of matter to the limb; then the patient should return to his usual routine, as it was before.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken bone begins to heal, then the patient should be fed a nutritious diet with abundant, rich foods that are easy to digest, such as food made from cooked wheat with water, rice, vegetables, and fruits, and fresh fish and wine.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen, the healing of the fracture will occur faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they occur in young people or the elderly who are weak, cannot always continue to heal and consolidate according to their natural tendency due to the debilitation of their limbs; rather, those that do heal will be like the bones of young children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches something similar to glue over the broken bone from every part, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and tightens itself, until they are glued together again and bound together, until it reaches the end of strength and firmness, as it was in the first place, unless something prevents it from its operations. And for this reason, it is necessary to provide nourishment to the patient with food that contains weight, moisture, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you should know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the members: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from a fracture of the bone of the back; and similarly all the remaining members exist in diversity. And I come with the remembrance of exposing every type of fracture in its chapter, distinguished from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of fractures of bones differ from each other as well.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because it becomes an arched fracture, besides the occurrence of stars in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes it becomes a fracture according to the length of the bone; and its fractures are oblique, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as they are in a reed when it is bent with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And they do not proceed: and it is a fracture with a knob and disruption at the head: and it is a fracture of a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And of every kind there is a skill, or proper instrument for its restoration, according to the remembrance of it, distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that by which the fracture of a bone is known, there results its torsion and prominence; and its appearance to the sense, and the sound it makes when compressed with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no visible torsion, nor any sound when the bone is touched with your hand, and it does not produce great pain, then there is no fracture there, but rather it may be a torsion or a small crack; so it is not necessary to move it with your hand and compression at all, but instead place something over it from among the medicines, whose remembrance comes after that event which happened in its place: then a tight binding should be applied gently.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the place bends and splits into two, apart from what happens there through stiffness, nonetheless every part moves away from its comparison; then you should begin from your own time to straighten it, equalizing it before it suffers a hot delay.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however it suffers a hot delay, then leave it for a few days until the delay from rest has passed.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to any way possible through gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you should know that the restoration of it and the equalization of it are easier than the bones, where fractures occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it yourself, according to what will bring back your memory of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If indeed there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this fractured member from both parts, if it is a hand or foot; or with your hand, if it is a smaller limb; or with two cords, or with a cord and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And you should position yourself where you place the member in a level position according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the fractured member extend; then try, as much as you can with all your skill, to return those additions to their places, and according to whatever method you can do in their positions; and beware, according to your strength, that it does not cause pain or injury to a weaker part through your operation.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And at that time, you should try and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it and equalize it according to your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of sudden stretching and strong compression, as many unskilful people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	Indeed, it often happens that through their own operation, they cause a feverish ulcer or contraction in the member, as we have seen many times from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then attach after equalization, and the appropriate operation, and tightening of that member, and rest, and tranquility: and warn the patient over it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it seek to avoid moving itself during their personal moments, sleep at their rotation, agitation, and during their tasks, and all their movements with their utmost power.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And to beware that the position of the member is not such that it follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	This is because when it feels pain or injury in the disposition of the member's position, then it is necessary to change it to another disposition from that one where it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be wary with it so that its position is equal and straight, so that there is no curvature in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of tightening the fractured member is according to what I narrate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured members differ in their fragility, magnitude, and form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, for those that are smaller among them, such as the arm, finger, sickle, and similar ones, it is necessary that there be an incision of a soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But for those that are larger among them, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary that there be a wide, hard incision made within them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Since the broad ligament connects the great member and draws it tight from all sides by an equal constriction, so that it does not admit of any spot entering within.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after you have freed yourself from equality, apply a liniment that is suitable for it, in a soft pad over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then, begin to cover the ligament over the place of the fracture with three or four layers of the bandage, according as the member requires; and hold your hand lightly with the ligament for a little while.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then, take it to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and hold it less tightly than your previous constriction of the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the bandage at the place of the fracture slightly, and gradually soften the constriction, until you receive from the healthy place a great relief.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another cloth and apply it again over the fractured site with new incisions.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Next, with the incision, go down to the lower part of the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And thus your work consists in contracting and softening the incision, according to what we said about the first higher incision.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the incisions a soft cloth or bandage that conforms to the curvature of the fracture, if there is any; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then make another incision over that same cloth.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Next, equalize the incisions that have been made properly; if there is no swelling or hot discharge at the site, do not alter them.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is swelling or hot discharge at the site, then place over it something that will stop the discharge and reduce the swelling; leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie over those incisions at that time.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the incisions should be made from the middle of a broad blade, carefully shaped; or they may be made from wood where sieves are made, from pine branches, or palm fronds, or calamus: and the width of every incision, according to this form and figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the stars placed above the same course be somewhat thicker and wider than the rest of the stars, and the length of the star should be according to what is permitted by the member's size and thickness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie the stars together with a string, loosening or tightening them according to the first course.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind them together with threads properly, as we mentioned about the course; and it should be so that your binding is above the fracture place more than necessary, and the more it extends from the fracture, the less the binding should be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be of medium size and thickness, and made from soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as those who do foolish operations often use their threads made from twisted linen, it is a great mistake; for the binding does not hold with them outside their proper strength.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine threads do not work either; for with them you cannot achieve what you want through the binding.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's width between the star and another star.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the weak part is damaged at the ends of the stars after binding in healthy places, then place under them a piece of soft wood or stained wool until nothing is harmed by it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with an ulcer and there is disruption in the skin, I approach it with recollection of its discussion in Chapter Two according to its particularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every fractured member needs to be bound with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	This is because when a member is large, you should not place splints on it from the first day, unless after five or seven days, or more, according to your safety from the event of the heat leaving.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the manner of plasters by which the ancients used to restore what was fractured and dislocated.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	§ The common method of plastering, restoring a fracture, consisting of several layers, especially for women and children, since it does not overcome heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And take some flour from the mill, and the core of the flour that hangs on the walls of the mill near the moving wheel: and make it as it is, except that you sift it with alum: and do not make its composition too thick or too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	§ Another method of plastering, restoring a fracture, dislocation, and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Prepare alum, and laudanum, and acacia, and henna, and mugath: and juice of all these in amounts of one part each of myrrh and aloe, and twenty parts of aloes; all these are to be crushed, sieved, and mixed with alethil water, or with white albus (albut) if the condition of the patient requires a heated complexion.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	It is indeed of good composition, it quickly restores broken bones, and it benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	§ Another method of the plaster that also benefits fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Prepare mugath, alum, and white althae, in amounts of ten parts myrrh and five parts aloe, and twenty parts acacia; all these are crushed finely, sieved, and prepared with water, or white albus (albut), by repeated grinding, and then administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	§ A method of the plaster for joints, and separated bones from their places; it soothes the pain caused by accidents to them, and cuts in the bones, and fractures.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take succid (lanolin), immerse it in vinegar, and boil it with oil; then apply it to the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster, there is no virtue of restoring health, but it is a good remedy for relieving the pain of a burning blister, and it expels pain itself.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The method of the plaster which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of the fig tree and the dry leaves of the paper birch, crush them all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The method of the abbreviated plaster, used for the restoration of a broken bone: and when you see the residue of the blister starting to heal.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of the tall almond tree, and chamomile, and violets, and herb flour, all in equal parts; crush them all, and prepare them with wine, if the member is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is indeed heated, then prepare it with moist coriander water, or with water alone, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of the plaster is stronger in resolving a severe blister that occurs during the restoration of the member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take the root of the tall almond tree, and linseed, and pomegranate, and melilot, and samas (an herb), and violets, and chamomile, all in equal parts; crush them all, and prepare them with willow water, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of that according to the warmth of the member and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that one should place something on a broken member during its restoration, except for bandaging done with lint and oil; nothing else. And he said it should be a medium between thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, was observed to place things on a broken member during its restoration, where there is loss of heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and similar substances from what we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of applying an emplastrum that relieves the injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take equal parts of myrrh, chickpea flour, and human hair cut finely, or bird feathers and goose down, and salt; mix them together, sift them, and prepare an emplastrum from them.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	However, the amount should be such that it remains firm, and then is dissolved as you consider at that time, if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place occurs; then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens to her at the place a burning itching, or restless pain, or swelling: then remove it immediately and dissolve the emplastrum from it; and take a soft cloth or a moist marine sponge, wet with warm water, wash it with this and apply it to the place until the itching stops and the pain is calmed.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then allow the member to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Next, place a strip of linen over it, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bind it there for one night, until you are free from the heat's discomfort, and the swelling of the member subsides, and its pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the process with a thinner and lighter bandage, and do not tighten it excessively or apply too much pressure until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you observe that the ulcer, redness, pain, swelling, and all other symptoms have completely disappeared, and you only need a bandage and compression, then repeat the process as you did at first.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of the aforementioned symptoms occur in the member, then do not remove the bandage unless it has been three, four, five, or seven days after application.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is removed after 20 days, according as you observe from the cure of the member, as we have said, until the fracture heals and the coagulation of the flesh above it draws close, then add to the bandage even more than your first tight binding; and also add, in food, more fat than before.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see that the place of the fracture is already dried up and weakened more than it should be, then know that nourishment is hindered from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, one should immerse it in warm water with every person who has a sore, and it should be done for all three days, and then the bandage can be changed.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this very procedure, it is nourished to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, what the foolish healers do with another drop of water from a fractured member, when it does not recover as it should and is restored according to its deformity, is an error from their operation and a great fear; and if it had been right, they would have said so in their books, and acted upon it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen their mark there at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	§ On the handling of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The kinds of fractures are diverse, and their forms numerous; and the causes thereof are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture that occurs from the blow of an axe; the blow removes the bone entirely until it reaches the sinew beneath the bone, just as an axe does to wood; and because of this, this type of fracture is called axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	The blade itself cuts into something bone, and it strikes its face, and the cut does not penetrate to its very end; and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, complete destruction.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a difference between two types of fractures, either major or minor.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture comes either crushing or chipping, and its cause is the striking of a bone against a stone, or falling onto a stone, or something similar.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which approaches the skin under the bone, or it is on the face of the bone, and it is a minor or major wound among these two fractures.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture that is hidden within the bone, delicate as a hair, and it is a minor crack, hence this type of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these, there is a fracture that occurs due to a blow or impact of a stone or something similar, which causes the bone layer to enter the inside and leaves an indentation, as happens to metal when struck and part of it enters the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	Indeed, this most often happens in the heads of humid bones, such as those of young children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And thus, for all these types of fractures of the leg bone, I return it to its proper place with the remembrance of that whole in its original state.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures through their detection, and inquiry about them with the hands, and removal of the corrupted flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The true kind of capillary is recognized by its detection on the bone, its cleansing, and its application of wax above it; for indeed, the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of fractures, however, consider first the condition of the patient; for if you see from their symptoms something that indicates a clear danger, such as terror, vomiting, extending or losing consciousness, impairment of intellect, loss of speech, syncope, acute fever, redness of the eyes, and similar conditions in numerous arrangements, then surely they will not recover; and if you see symptoms that do not terrify you, and you hope for healing, then begin to treat them.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	This is the case when a patient comes to you injured initially upon their injury; and it is that during cold days, then you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day according to any arrangement.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during hot days, then you should strive to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it corrupts what is under the bone from swelling, and causes those conditions we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If a fracture of the bone has reached the point where it touches the skin that covers the brain, and it is with cracks and pulls, then you must cut the broken and strained part, as I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And you should also clean the wounded head and remove the debris from the bone as best you can; and according to the shape of the wound and what is loose over the injured part.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If this happens to you while examining the bone, and there is bleeding or a hot swelling, then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And you should fill the space with cloth soaked in wine and rose oil; and make the wound rest until the swelling subsides, and be secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is to cut the bone with a sharp blade; and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another blade, slightly narrower than the first; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then he also administers a broader scalpel than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you should have with you various kinds of scalpels: some broader and some narrower; all of them sharp at their extremities, either made from iron or tempered; and use them with ease when striking against the scalpel, so as not to hit the head or damage it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If, however, the bone is hard and firm, then you must make holes around it before applying the scalpels, using what are called non-penetrating chisels; they are not so named unless they do not reach the flesh that lies beyond the bone's edge. This is because the chisel has a rounded tip above the sharp edge of the bone, and its slightly curved shape prevents it from sinking in too deeply or penetrating through the bone's thickness.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And you should acquire many of these chisels, each suited to the thickness of the bone, until you have a set for every skull; their sharp ends should be of appropriate length and width according to the thickness of the particular skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three types of chisels, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of drilling around a broken bone is as follows: you place the chisel over the bone and use your fingers to rotate it until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then exchange the drill for another location and place what is between each hole the quantity of the radius's thickness, or roughly that amount.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with scalpels what is between each hole from the bone, and make it thinner than you can with the finest leatherman's tool, as we have said, until the bone is stripped, either by hand or with another instrument that you have prepared for this purpose, such as pliers or fine saws.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to be careful not to touch the drill or scalpel with anything from the syringe.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have surrounded the bone with perforations and it has been separated from the syringe, if it is still connected to it, and you have extracted the main part, you should smooth and level its end that remains in the bone with another similar instrument like a scalpel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thin and delicate more than other scalpels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains any small bone or tissue, then take it easily with whatever is at your hand from among the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then take care of the wound after that with bandages and ointments as we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And there is another method of operation that is easy and entirely free from fear; this was said by Galen, and he praised it highly, and this is the essence of his words.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	In the first instance, it is necessary for you to begin by detaching the portion of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and evident; until you have detected that part, and placed under it the extremity of this lenticular incision, whose form is as follows.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part does not cut anything softly; and its acute edge, when it turns in two directions along its length, as you can see, is directed towards the siphon, with its face cutting sharply into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the incision on one side with a small mallet until you have cut through the entire bone easily, as it requires; and be careful from the fear that nothing untoward should happen to you.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not more foolish or ignorant among men, and were not sleeping, then if there remained something attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it off with the extremity of the same lenticular incision, and free it from it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is indeed freed from it without damage or fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	If the fracture of a bone does not penetrate to the panniculus, and what is detached from the bone is its face, and roughnesses and subtle scars remain in it, then it is necessary that you smooth out that roughness, and uproot those scars with very fine rasories from which you prepared a variety of quantities, so that it is possible for you to use them appropriately in every place, and more rectly according to what the operation leads you to, and the shape of the fractured bone.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer those rasories in proportion to how far you first reach the bone, using them more widely.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the finer ones after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not stop doing that continuously until you reach the point of administering the thinnest and most subtle ones of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small cracks and subtle fractures, it is necessary that you apply care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter that should not be hidden over all, for whoever has any study in this art, and persists over what we have written, and demonstrates it in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If the panniculus is detected and retained when you uproot the bone, then you should take a piece of linen cloth according to the size of the wound, immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth doubled or tripled, and immerse it in rose wine and oil, and place it on top of the first cloth, and make it as easy as possible to avoid straining the throat.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a wide bandage over it, but do not tighten it unless necessary to hold the wound in place, and remove it after one or two days of this treatment until you are free from fever's grasp.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then untie it and apply medicines to it as needed to alleviate excessive dryness, such as lily roots, herb flour, thistle dust, aristolochiac, and similar substances, and make a powder from these medicines to be applied to the wound until it dries up.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply to it all medicines whose properties are designed to clean and not cause pain.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And be careful according to your ability so that the wound is clear during your treatment, free from impurity of ointment or crusting.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Do not let any pus form on it at all, for when pus forms on the skin of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, and causes great harm afterwards, and this has already happened to the throat when its surface is cleaned by pus, especially when the care of it is neglected, turning black.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider then if an accident happens to a patient with the condition we described, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackening does not occur, except due to the medicine placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause such blackening, then you should take one part honey, three parts rose oil, and a cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the wound; afterward, care for the wound with suitable remedies until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	§ On the restoration of our body when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken except at both its upper parts simultaneously or one of them; for they are two bones, and the lower part is cartilaginous, so it does not break, but only experiences friction, torsion, and compression.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of the nose breaks, then you should insert a slender finger into the nasal hole and equalize the fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and this should be done skillfully, easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And furthermore, so as not to cause pain to that part above the patient during your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If there is a fracture in the upper part of the nose and it cannot be reached with the fingers, then it should be adjusted so that the end of the radius, where there is a small thickness, can be used.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed there is a fracture in both parts, then do it like this: and when repairing it on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the time when the wound has healed with warmth.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a thin piece of linen, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two thin pieces if the fracture is in two parts, and let the thickness of the linen fill the nasal hole.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient healers said that the linen should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That does not seem right to me, rather the linen should be soaked in a paste made from almonds and ground flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the linen until the bone hardens and the cartilage solidifies.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a quill from a goose's nail is inserted into the nose where a thin cloth has been placed over it; and thus it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, so that the patient is not hindered from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not a necessary thing.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, do the opposite.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If, while operating on the nose again, a second aperture occurs, apply a hot compress with lint or cotton soaked in rose oil or some other mild ointment.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	However, if there is no second aperture with a hot compress, then one should apply a poultice of sesame flour and ground turd mixed with albuginac.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft pad over it and do not tie the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are indeed broken or crushed, then you must cut through them and remove the pieces with the appropriate instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then use the appropriate scalpel and take care of it so that it does not fall out, and strengthen it with suitable dressings or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nose and lip, then it is necessary to treat it with liniment and administer a lead catheter until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured.
Caput V.	**Chapter V. Head**
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound: observe then if there is a fracture only on the outer side, and it is not broken into two parts, and it heals towards the inside; then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if there is a fracture in the right side of it, you should insert your left index finger into the lower jaw's hole; conversely, if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the right hand's index finger; and with it push the swelling of the fracture towards the inside from the outer side with your other hand, correctly aligned with the center of the bone.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the lower jaw's fracture has already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to apply extension on both parts according to their proper alignment; until equalization becomes possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	However, if it has already happened that the teeth are dislocated or broken: then tie them from which you hope to keep remaining with a gold, silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place the severed mandible on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a doubled cloth, and on top of that a large, well-made frame; or a piece of sole leather cut to an equal length with the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it tightly according to the preparation of its binding, and its application should be continued until it is not destroyed; and especially instruct the patient to use tranquility and calmness, and give him light food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	However, if you think that the shape is already changing in some way, then remove it and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten out what was altered from it and apply a plaster made of ground flour, with albus or sesame flour, after you have removed the flesh; and place a soft woolen cloth over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	So long as that plaster remains attached and the arrangement of the bones is not altered, do not disturb it until it heals; or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often tightened for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, an abscess forms during that time, then administer what we have said many times for its relief until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if there is a fracture with a wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If a fragment is separated from the bone, either a small piece or a shard, then be careful here to remove those fragments of the shard with whatever instruments you have at hand.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If the wound opening is tight, then widen it with a phlebotom according to the amount needed by you.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed those shards, and nothing remains of them, clean the wound opening if it is wide, and if not, place over it whatever plasters are suitable for that, and keep it covered until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	§ On the restoration of the furca (fork) when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Head VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the furca is most often broken from its anterior part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it may break and separate into two, other than when shards occur within it, and this is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or, alternatively, as occurs in the bone with shards: and this is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Thus, when there is a fracture with an open wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in such a case when there is a fracture without an open wound, is that you should have two assistants; one should hold the broken bone steady, while the other extends the neck towards the affected part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers, until its shape is correct, according to what is necessary; and there should be neither a bump nor a hollow on it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place a sphere under the bone, made of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to the amount needed; extend and raise the bone with your hand, until the fracture is equalized, as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the end of the bone towards the outside, because it has reached a depth, then the patient should lie on his side, and place a medium-sized pebble under his shoulder, and have an assistant press down on his shoulder until the opening of the fracture moves up towards the top; and then straighten the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel a grating from the bone and it moves, then you should find the source of that grating and extract the offending part with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then use a saw or other instrument that you have prepared for that purpose, after placing under the fork an instrument that preserves safety, and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the form of it.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is shaped like a snail shell, without any indentation.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to the need for it from the magnitude of the bones and the size of its structure.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	However, its length should also be according to what is possible for you during the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends, as you can see: one end is wide, and the other is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	However, if the fracture of the bone that you have cut when extracting the foreign body is wide, and safe from further damage by heat, then join the two edges of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the fracture is small or there is no further damage by heat, then fill the wound with linen and wool according to the amount of the cut wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If there is an infection with heat, then apply a cloth dipped in rose oil, vinegar, and wine on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The true rigidity of bones when they are without fracture or incision is like placing over the bone a plaster made from flour and chalk.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft pad over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its joint if necessary.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bandage, that is, the long wheel used by the Saracens, which should be about as wide as a palm or slightly more.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a small, doubled strip over the pad and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a star-shaped piece of thin wood, whose width and length are each the size of three fingers.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the star-shaped piece in the correct position over the fracture and its place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the bandages over the fracture as desired, and wrap them around his neck both above and below the healthy joint, and under the affected joint, and bring them back over all parts, and as you see that the rigidity holds the fracture firmly, so it should not be removed from above the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, you must look at the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever the ligament softens, and you see the bone begin to move, then straighten it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's sleep on his back and put a pillow under his armpit near his sleep so that when he turns, assistance is brought to him from his own side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Thus the fracture of the forearm bone is healed through the elevation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie the arm to his collarbone, and do not loosen the ligament unless an accident occurs from itching or from a distance, until after twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see that its face is facing it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the bandage, and leave it until it is restored and congealed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed, the fracture of the forearm is bound and comforted for almost twenty-eight days, and it happens in some men in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	**On the restoration of the fracture of the spatula.**
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spatula rarely breaks, except at its wide end, and not even then are its edges broken off.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When, however, this place breaks and it breaks in the middle of it, and it is not recognized except by touch; then, according to the form of the fracture, one should attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it according to the natural shape of all possible skill.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place a layer of mill dust and alum on the wound, and a soft pad, and put a small piece of doubled cloth on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on top of it a wide lattice made of thin wood according to the size of the spatula or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If there is indeed a dip in any part of the spatula, then equalize that depression with a soft pad until the lattice descends according to its equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then gently pull from above with an elongated piece of cloth, applying sufficient tension and ensuring the stability of the lattice, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligature every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the ligature becomes softened, tighten it and restore it to its place; and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is restored in twenty days or in forty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then loosen the ligature; and you will be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is made of bones whose connection is not to be feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if it extends from a bone fragment and irritates under the skin, then cut above it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we said regarding the fracture of the fork from the heat of a fever, if something happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	**On the restoration of the fractured chest.**
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in two at its middle, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities are indeed broken and shattered by its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle of its bone breaks, which bends downwards, and a severe pain occurs, along with difficulty in breathing and coughing, and perhaps it bleeds, and the fracture is evident to the senses, restoration is achieved so that the patient can regain their strength on their back, and they should be placed between the palms of their hands for support.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press the shoulders and bring the ribs together from both parts or sides with the hands, and gradually equalize it, as much as possible, until the bone shape returns to normal.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and dressing on top of it, and put a thin board from willow or chestnut wood, or similar light materials, over it after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then securely bind it with a bandage over the fractured bone, so that it does not move, and wrap it around towards the back several times, tightening the bandage gently.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then regularly check the bandage and tighten it whenever it loosens, and if its dissolution causes itching or irritation at the site, or pain, or swelling, then loosen it, remove the plaster, and correct any misalignment in the course of its healing.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see that it is facing towards it: and attach a strap to it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of bones when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Head IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that the fracture of bones does not occur except in thick places which follow the back, and from their ends towards the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not suffer friction unless because they are cartilage-like.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of itself is not hidden from sense at the inquiry with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that the fracture is equal to the fingers according to the possible way, until the shape is attained, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and tie the broken bone with strings, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is towards the interior, then there occurs in the patient a severe pain, and a piercing, as that which occurs in him who has pleurisy; for the bone pierces the membrane, and to it also comes difficulty of breathing, coughing, and spitting of much blood: and this is a difficult healing.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now ancient craftsmen have devised many clever devices in it, and among them are those who say that you should place foods for the sick which cause inflammation and congestion, so that the stomach is inflamed, extended, and the fracture is driven outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	Indeed, we should avoid causing rapid heat in the abscess if it is not necessary.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	However, if it has already occurred, then he adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: A swift flow should be placed over the place, then it should be sucked out with force, and it is more similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, they fear that the swift flow might attract excess moisture to the site due to the weakness of the condition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: The site should be cooperated with wool that is already submerged in hot oil: and small pieces of cloth are placed between the ribs until it is filled: so that a uniform binding can be made when the swelling recedes according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the patient undergoes treatment for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	Which, if it restricts the patient's breathing, more than they can tolerate, and the bone pierces the membrane with painful punctures, and we fear for the patient, then we must break through the site and release the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place over it an instrument that preserves the cure, of which the memory has gone before: and we shall cut the bone with ease, and also cut into it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we shall gather together the two edges of the wound if it is large with a suture: and we shall care for it with dressings until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If, meanwhile, a hot abscess should occur, then apply it with appropriate care, and insert little pieces of rose oil into the place, and put over it what is suitable for the abscess. And so shall the sick be cured with it.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, the patient should also lie on their side over which they were sleeping until they are healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	§ On the restoration of the fracture of the spine and collarbone.
Caput X.	Head X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	In the bones of the collarbone, indeed, comes sometimes a fracture, and rarely does friction occur to them: likewise in the bones of the spine (dorsal vertebrae).
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore such a thing happens to anyone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider (and ponder).
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see that his hand is already softened, and numb, and dead; and he cannot move it, nor stretch it out, nor contract it; and when you press it with your fingers or prick it with a point, he feels nothing, neither does he experience pain in them: then know that he will not be healed, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If, when moved, they feel a tightness with the fingers and a puncture, then know that the concave part of the bone is sound, and that the patient will be cured with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it affects the spine in a similar way, and you want to know if it will heal or not, then consider its feet: if you see that they are softened, and it occurs to them as it does to the hands, then when it lies on its back, breath and straining leave it without will, and when it turns over on its belly, straining leaves it without will, and when it turns over on its back again, and wants to move, but cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not despair in its treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing of that happens to it, then the case is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happens from that is as follows: to apply a compress with cold oil on the affected spine, or when the swelling subsides, use vinegar.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Apply this several times a day until the swelling subsides. Then place over it a bandage that is comforting and drying, and tightly wrap it with a strap, and particularly instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He should not sleep over the part where pain is felt until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If this happens near the friction of the satyated bone, or anything that has already separated from it: then it is necessary to cut through the skin and remove that part.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join the two edges of the wound together with stitches if it is large.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with some suitable ointment until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the last part of the bone breaks and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary to insert your left thumb into the anus, and with your other hand, equalize the broken bone as best as possible.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place something over it and remove the protrusion, and care for the wound with the preceding treatment until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	**On the restoration of the anca:**
Caput XI.	**Chapter XI.**
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the anca rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their fracture is not, unless there is a comminution at the extremities; and they split along their length and bend towards the inner parts. This causes pain to the affected area and a puncture, and the limb that breaks becomes stunned.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is that you extend your hand over it until you rest on the fracture as it is shown in its figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at its extremities, then equalize that fracture according to what is prepared for you from equalization, until it becomes similar to its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	However, if the fracture is along its length, or it already bends towards the inner parts, then make the affected person lie on their side until a restoration for that fracture is prepared.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equalized it, place a plaster over it; then, place a frame made of wood or leather on top and tighten the bandage so that you do not fear any change in the fracture or shifting of the frame.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And it should be equal to the amount that fills it, until the bandage takes hold according to its equalization; and especially instruct the patient to sleep on their back or side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	However, if a feverish chafing occurs, then stop extending it and its restoration until the chafing sits down; then place on it what is appropriate according to what came before, and return to its restoration, tightening it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If there is a fracture or dislocation of the bone, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	**On the restoration of fractures (with the aid of) God.**
Caput XII.	**Head (Chapter) XII.**
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	That aid is between the elbow and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of these methods is: take a flat wood of medium thickness, according to this form that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligaments are bound at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from the elevated position, and the weak person sits on it.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches its joint, where a curve is attached to the middle of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then something heavy is suspended from above, so that the assistant below extends his hand towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the surgeon should manipulate the fracture with his hands until it heals as it should.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	There is another method to help the patient regain strength on his own head: and suspend his hand from his neck with a ligature.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants to hold one of them above the fracture with his hands, and let the other hold it below, extending each towards their respective sides.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger extension, then tighten the ligature below the fracture and above it with another ligature; and each of the two assistants should extend their respective parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the end of the humerus, then it is necessary to place one ligature below the acromion and another below the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary to place a ligature over that area and also over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease without strain until it aligns as it should and is given proper attention; then tighten it if there is no risk of fever.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed there is a fever, then release the tension until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place over it a cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the wound rests; then tie it, and the manner of tying it is such that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then apply a new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then gather the arm over the same aid, and place his hand open over his humerus.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and tie over the aid of the arm, so that the arm stays in place like the stars: if nothing prevents you from it, nor anything alters above you from the fractured bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If, however, something alters above you from the fractured bone, then use stars: and it is such that you place over the fracture itself a star which is wider and stronger than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between each star the width of a finger, and the length of the stars according to the fracture, with the addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tie over the stars the bandage as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is such that your bandage be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more a fracture is elongated, the less is the contraction.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of the stars and the contraction, as we have said, at the hour when you restore the member, then do this: and if you fear an abscessed heat, then leave the contraction and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Consider then the ligament for all three days, so that there is no itching, swelling, or hindrance to food reaching the member due to the tension of the contraction.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct it all according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the ligament, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the nurse lie on her back and place her hand on her belly; and put under her a pillow filled with equal wool.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day, so that the shape of the fractured member is not loosened, or the ligament softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct it all with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And likewise, for the patient's food, arrange it according to the order we have prescribed, so that it be a light food at first, until the mouth begins to close; then it is necessary that the food be made more substantial.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the usual course of recovery and to reduce the swelling, it is necessary for the limb to be immobilized for forty days. Therefore, at that time, it should be loosened, and a bath administered, and treated with balms and ointments that correct the condition.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is severe and dislocated, then do not remove the ligature and do not reduce it until after fifty days, that is, until two months have passed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	## On the Restoration of a Fractured Arm
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, called the humerus and radius.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of these, one is smaller (the radius), and it follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is larger (the humerus), and it is placed under the smaller one at the inferior part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Therefore, perhaps only the larger bone (humerus) is broken, or perhaps both (the humerus and radius) are broken simultaneously.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the upper part of the bowel is ruptured, its restoration is easy and its healing is more so.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower part of the bowel is ruptured, it is a severe fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are ruptured at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is ruptured is the upper part of the bowels, then it is fitting for a doctor to assist at its restoration by placing an extension on the bowel with ease until it heals properly.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the large bowel is what is ruptured: then it is necessary to place a stronger constriction with great care.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to place the hand in the form of a palm during its restoration and also extend the stretched extension over the pulse.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be placed higher than all the other fingers; and the joint should be at the base of all the fingers, or with any remaining joints; and the weaker one should sit square on itself, and the pulse should be in front of it, or directly in line with it, at a height where it does not experience any weakness.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the assistant should extend the arm from its lower part, or with his hand, or using a ligature.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant should extend it similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the surgeon should adjust the opening, until it reduces to a form as good or better than possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are jagged edges in a bone fracture, then try to reduce all the splintered parts to their proper place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed it appears separated with jagged edges piercing the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it, then find above it, and remove it according to the method we have mentioned regarding those described previously.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	However, if the fracture is with a wound, I have already dealt with that particular chapter, so take care of that wound accordingly.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If, however, a hot apotheosis occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then line a cloth with a mixture of red ochre and white wax, in the middle between thickness and thinness, and tightly wrap it over the affected area until the apotheosis is soothed; then remove the ochre and apply a prepared plaster from ground flour and albumen.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place stars (stitches), and let the star placed over the fracture be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of stitches (stars) is six in most arrangements; either the fracture is in one hollow, or in two hollows at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Next, place your bandage over the site of the fracture stronger and more firm, and a little more tightly towards the higher or lower part of the fracture, or place a looser bandage over a tighter one as mentioned earlier in the introduction to this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture should be soft and damp, not hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And the thread used to bind it should be of linen, of medium thickness between fine and coarse, as we have mentioned.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and ligamen after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something should happen that requires correction, such as itching occurring in a member: then it is necessary to immerse the member in warm water until the itching ceases, and release the tight bandage until it is relieved, then continue with the binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has already become looser, and the bone has already come away, and similar things: then straighten it all with your strength, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the member due to excessive binding, then it is necessary to soften the bandage slightly and release it for a few days until it can receive its proper nourishment, then tighten it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, nothing of what we have said affects the patient, then it is not necessary to resolve it unless after twenty days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the patient should be suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And his neck should be equal [in position], and be guarded by its own strength from agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days, or perhaps in thirty-two days, and possibly in eighteen days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this is according to the arrangements of the humors and the dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	## On the Healing of Fractures of the Hand
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that it rarely happens that the fractures of the hand occur at the joints of the fingers or at the tendons.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him unless there has been friction many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When, therefore, there occurs a fracture or bruising of a limb, it is necessary that the patient be seated with his leg in a position of rest and that a seat be placed before him at an equal level.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on it, extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant should extend the broken bones and adjust them as the physician directs, until they are united with a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary for him to apply a plaster and poultice, unless there is danger of a hot apothema (fever).
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a bandage on top of it according to the amount of space, and you have already covered it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	However, if the fracture is near the bottom of the foot, then make a sphere-like shape from cloth and tell the patient to wrap it tightly around his broken limb with his foot; then tie it with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And the bandage should be made of skin, which is soft so that it adheres to the skin of the foot; and tie it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	However, if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary to place a bandage above and another below the foot; and the hand should be kept straight and open.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then he applies a strap as required by the hand and extends it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If there is a fracture of any of the joints of the fingers, and it is the thumb, it should be set as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it is tied with the sole: and if necessary, a splint should be placed straight and firm so that the fracture is lifted and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	However, if the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, index, ring, or little finger, then it should be set and tied with the healthy finger that follows it, or all of them according to their sequence, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a firm splint on top of it, as we said regarding the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that arrangement of the heated splint, oppose it as necessary when something happens from it according to its course.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	## Restoring Fractures of the Hip Joint.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip joint often breaks, and this is felt because it turns inward and toward the rear.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is such that one ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient lies stretched out on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then, every accessory ligament should be extended to its side according to equality; and this is when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If, however, the fracture is close to the root of the hip, then one ligament should be positioned towards the pelvis so that its extension goes upwards; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly, if there is a fracture close to the knee, then one ligament near the knee should be positioned so that its extension goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon should align the bone with both of his hands until it is reduced according to the similarity of the natural figure; and the bone is joined with a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you apply an ointment and a bandage, if the member does not become contaminated.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If this happens in a contaminated ulcer: then leave it for some days until the inflammation of the ulcer subsides, then resume your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The structure of this condition must be such.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to cover the fracture with a firm bandage; that is, bind it twice or three times and leave an excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then bandage the foot until it reaches the heel near the root of the toes.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come out from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up the excess from over the foot and thigh from the other side.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place the stars over the thigh at the location of the fracture itself and place one star from them over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the space between the foot and thigh with soft cloth to provide tightness.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle towards the location of the fracture, either three or four times.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more it is elongated with the ligament from the location of the fracture, the less tight and softer your bandage will be, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then turn your attention to the two ends of the thread, which you have inserted between the hip and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Now tie it with both of the three stars that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then insert the two ends of the thread below, until you reach the foot's root.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tie both strings on the other side of the stars' ends, so that the ligament does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the string over that, as long as it remains, so that no damage, ulceration, swelling, or similar occurs to the member.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of that occurs.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, with the removal of the thread and correction of what has happened from that, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed there is a fragment of bone that pierces the bone, then you should do the same to it, if possible.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find a way over it and move it aside, and take care of the one whose memory preceded it, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is confined to adding stars to it, as we said in the aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of such a fracture, it does not happen that the patient becomes lame.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, except for applying another crutch to it, then it is necessary that the one whose leg is injured always walks with a limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is either confined or added slightly, or reduced slightly, within fifty days; all of it depends on the diversity of compositions and the remaining dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	**On the restoration of the fracture of the knee-joint.**
Caput XVI.	Head XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the fracture of the knee-joint rarely occurs, but it suffers friction many times.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed it suffers a fracture, then not only is there a crack or split, but also an opening in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is that, with or without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over that with all its sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that it equals what has been disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it is aggregated and connected according to what is possible from equality and ease, and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster of sesame flour, or mill, with egg white: and place over it a round pad, if needed: and tighten above it a suitable constriction to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have mentioned in the other fractures, such as a hot apposition and similar ones: so that you oppose to every occurrence what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	## On the Restoration of a Fractured Hip (Crurus)
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the hips are two bones, of which one is thick, and is called the hip bone: and the other is delicate, and is called the femur.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And both kinds of fractures happen to the two bones of the arm: and because of that, its restoration is done like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones are broken at once, the crumple (or fragment) turns towards all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a more delicate bone is broken, the fragment turns towards the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a thick bone is broken, you will find it pointing downwards, and they are among the ones that won't be hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then apply the extension, equalization, and binding of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a severe one with many pieces: then the extension should be smaller and your relief gentler.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And indeed, in the leg, there is something like a bow from the operation on the arm; and it is as when you equalize the stars and complete all your work, then take two strips of pine wood, which are used in making the sun's screens that are placed under the boards: and they become like spatulas of the palm: and choose among them those with a moderate thickness, not too thin: and their length should be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each cloth with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other part on the other side; they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then he ligates two fasciae at three places from both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When the tightness is forbidden, the crus (tendon or ligament) bends to the right and left, and remains in a good state of rest.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed, a splint should be made of wood according to the length of the crus (leg), and placed within it so as to preserve it from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And above all, it is necessary that you do this in the fracture when there is an open wound with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the crus (leg) every day, and strive with that last effort against detachment, or swelling, or any other conditions.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore something of these (conditions) happens, then oppose it with what is necessary until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On fractures of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Head XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture of the calcaneus does not happen completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot indeed sometimes fracture, and the toes also rarely fracture; and they do not occur to them unless there is friction in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If there is a fracture of the bones of the foot, and you see those bones rising up above each other over time, then the patient should place their foot on the prepared ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand there and place your foot on what raises those bones; then press or step on it; and keep it level until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster and remove the splint; and place under the foot a small board with two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it tightly with the foot using bandages, after you have wrapped it with cloth and other things it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When they have passed three or four days, then loosen the binding.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For when you find the bones equalized, or fractured, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation on them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If, however, some fingers are broken, then restore them, and equalize them as I have told you regarding the restoration of the fingers on the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger's end (astel) along the length of the finger, and make it a little wider; then place this board under the foot as I have told you, and bind it tightly.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed what is fractured extends from two, or three, or more bones, then place over every finger a pad of its quantity, wrapped in linen cloth; and tighten the splint on the lower part of the foot; and let it stand over one head of the splint outside the vein of the foot, so that it may hold good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you not to forget, but to consider all that I have told you about the rest of fractures from accidents that we mentioned, and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	§ On the fracture of the woman's vulva, and the ribs, and the man's scrotum.
Caput XIX.	Head XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit squatting.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her slightly towards the back part of her own body, and hold her from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife should fill her vulva with as much as she can hold, until she is full, and let it be like a sphere in the woman's body.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman should be moved, and her back raised little by little.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	That bone emerges from its socket until it forms a sphere-like shape in front of the vulva, and the fractured bone returns to its original position.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a small cloth over it.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When he wants to urinate, remove the bandage easily, then let him urinate, and bring it back according to the manner in which you originally inserted it; then return it to its original position.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	He should do this for seven days or so, for the bone itself will be restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a warm cloth and tie it over the opening with a reed tube, and insert the whole cloth into his vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with strength until the cloth inside the vulva swells, for the fracture will be healed.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it should be bandaged and left for several days, as we have described, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the chest bone of a man or woman is fractured, then administer for its restoration, and use the same method we have described for the healing of the anchial (or sternum) bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these close fractures, which barely touch it, especially for those who are students or practitioners of medicine.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	Understand my book well, for the very fracture itself indicates to you, in many configurations, the right path for its restoration and tightening; therefore, understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the bone of man breaks, take the quill of the goose and insert it into the fracture.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place a poultice on it made of cloth, and let it be wrapped up, and released after three days or so, and it will be healed, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	§ On the restoration of bone fractures, when they are with a wound.
Caput XX.	Head XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for whoever experiences a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or any other bone that needs immediate attention, like the leg bones, and leeching is applied straightaway: If you are certain about the conditions of the leeching, as we have mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound bleeds, then you must cut off the part that is bleeding, so as to clean and dress it three times a day: If you do not have anything else at hand.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to repair the fracture on that same day; and do not postpone it unless an abscess develops.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed an abscess forms, then allow the restoration to continue until the ninth day, provided the abscess is drained.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause it to develop into a bad complication.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	However, if the broken bone is prominent above the skin: then you must, in order to reduce it, apply pressure with your hands easily and gently.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, the extension is not prepared and its alignment cannot be adjusted with your hands: then reduce it using this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument made of iron, which is seven or eight fingers in length, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for that reason, it is necessary for the doctor to take from them three or four, according to the amount required for that treatment, in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round; and have a small thickness so that it is not doubled up under the pressure placed on top of it during the operation: and its ends should be sharp, with a margin at their tips.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And on top of it, for its thickness, from its middle to its lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it is necessary to place the sharp end of the instrument over the prominent end of the bone, and push it with a single stroke until the bone returns to its original position and is aligned correctly.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, strive to align the ends of the fractured bone again.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the ends of the bone are too small to accept the instrument properly, then it is necessary to cut into the end of the bone until the instrument has a firm grip.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them at all with what we have mentioned, then cut it with what is appropriate for the scissors, as we have said, or saw it with a saw of any kind that is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then, smooth the remaining part of the bone from its roughness and fine splinters.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone is reduced and experiences a sudden intense pain after reduction, then you know that the bone has not returned to its original position.
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore, do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For when you confer great strength upon the weak, as your restoration completes the work you do to the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in black, astringent wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And use it properly if it is suitable for summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place anything over the sore that is black, nor any substance with oil in it; so as not to cause putrefaction and corruption within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer herbs at the hour of completion of your bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the detected sore; so as to cut with scissors a hole into the infections according to the amount of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And be careful not to strain the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many times these foolish doctors have done this, and they have caused their patients to suffer either death or corruption or putrefaction, that is, loss of blood.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your bandage be soft, flexible, different from the tightness of the other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad or a large wound, and some bad accident has occurred over it, as we have described, and you feel pain at the suspended place, then it is not necessary to put stars over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make incisions over the hard parts at the location of the stars, and tighten it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	However, if after one or two days you see the wound beginning to form pus, then remove the hard cloth that you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply poultices and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the four-ingredient ointment and others like it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is appropriate for you to loosen the ligature.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the member be prepared so that pus can flow out of it easily downward.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days have passed since the wound and it does not consolidate nor is pus drained from it, then know that there are seriously damaged small bones there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why it is necessary that you should inquire about a wound with care.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	Indeed, from among those that are separated, remove them and extract the foreign body itself.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And as for those that are not separated from it and they pierce the member and cause pain, try to cut them off, and remove them in every way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If a wound becomes infected or gangrenous, or any other form of corruption and putrefaction occurs, then it is necessary to confront each of these with what is appropriate for their treatment, which has been described in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And regarding what is necessary for my speech to continue, and when you should make your present mind known, if it breaks off and protrudes beyond the member, such as the hip bone or other large members, do not attempt any attraction, for often death comes from that, indeed, let it be, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it would disappear on its own after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Therefore, care for the wound if it appears to you, and otherwise, let it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	**On the treatment of a nodule at the site of a fracture.**
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times this condition occurs during the course of healing a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially those near the joints, and it becomes infected because of that shape of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the member from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, if the inflammation is recent, administer medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sage, and acacia, among others.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you may obtain some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg albumen, or with vinegar: and apply them to the inflammation in a poultice, and bind them tightly over the affected area.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And do not remove the bandage for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then remove it, and apply another one, until the inflammation is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind a sheet of lead tightly over it.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead is indeed a property that removes all that is feared from the body.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	However, if a contraction has already turned into a stone, and it is tight, and urgency demands its removal, then find it from the upper part of that place and cut off the protruding excess; or scrape it with some rasors until it is removed, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On healing, when a part remains after that which was affected, it does not recover according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Head XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture heals and the limb remains weak after that which was affected, it does not become strong unless many causes are at play.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of these is that the solution of the ligament and its binding does not occur as it should; either because of the excess of tightness of the ligaments, preventing nutrition from reaching the limb; or due to an excessive number of applications at the wrong time; or because of a lack of blood in a weak body and its debilitation.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment for it is to feed the weak one and make their body tender until blood increases in them.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place a bandage over the member: so that it attracts the skin to itself for much nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And he should continue to moisten it with warm water until nourishment flows, and then return to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	§ On the healing of broken bones when they are restored slowly.
Caput XXIII.	Head XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When a member, having been restored after its healing, exhibits tortuosity or protrusion of the fractured bone, or some other deformity; and because of this, it is disfigured, yet does not prevent the member from performing its natural function; then it is unnecessary to accept his statement that considers the member to be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And indeed there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed reprehensible, leading to death or great fear, so that it becomes mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	Indeed, if the weakness and deformity are recent, then it should be moistened with warm water in which softening herbs are cooked, such as almond leaves, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made for her with a softened plaster, as is properly done in making a dressing.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucilage of the root of the high plant, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and apply it as a plaster.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take the fat figs, and mix them with Columbine clay and other similar medicinal substances that reduce hardening.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the swelling is relieved with constant friction, old and gentle, which is done with damp hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And the movement of the member should be applied to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the curvature has already progressed and become strong, and it has hardened like stone, and treatment is needed for it with a knife; then it must be cut from above, and the continuity of the bone should be dissolved, and what exceeds from the swelling or bone with delicate scissors; and relief should be given to that part with care and attention.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	**On the Discussion of Dislocation**
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of some joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	For it is prevented from its motion, and the form of the member is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes pains to occur in the weak, and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore someone experiences a dislocation, then it is necessary to hasten towards its restoration; nor should it ever be delayed.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place will be lost, and perhaps along with it, the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Because of that, therefore, it should not be moved, nor extended in the hour of its loss.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes spasms to occur, and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	Indeed, when that occurs, then it is necessary to prepare for the bloodletting of the infirm.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is released until the dislocation becomes quiet.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is wrapped with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	It should then be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And it shall cure every member as memory of its place returns to it.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	Indeed, I have already organized the chapters on dislocation, even according to what came before in the fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower parts.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	§ On the care of the dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are seldom dislocated unless rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the jaws occurs according to one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they may be removed from their places by slight tug, and become soft for a little while.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they may be dislocated entirely and completely until they become soft towards the chest part, until the discharge of saliva ceases, and it cannot hold itself, nor can it close its jaw, and its tongue is covered with saliva while speaking.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When, however, the dislocation is slight, then it returns to many positions of itself with difficulty.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If it is a complete dislocation, treat it immediately; do not delay until the end. The attendant should hold the head of the patient, and the surgeon should insert his thumb into the root of the mandible dislocation between the jaw and the skull, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	If the dislocation is on both sides, let him insert two thumbs at once.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of his fingers should be outside, as he holds it firmly.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to clean his jaws and move them freely for chewing on both sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the surgeon should adjust the jaw and gently push it back to its place until it returns to its normal position.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated at the same time, then apply a hot water and oil poultice until it becomes easier to reduce them; do not delay the reduction of the jaws at all, as we said before.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they return and align, and the patient's jaw is closed, and they do not open, then place a poultice of cloth with wax, made of rose oil, on them.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	It is then bound with ease using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	Then let the patient sleep with their head raised between two pillows, so that it does not move to the right or left, nor tries to chew or swallow anything; instead, let them be given soft food until the pains subside and the jaw relaxes. Then they may eat what they wish and take it easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let them not strain their mouth during eating and drinking, or yawning, until the jaw relaxes and heals.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they have been dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then often fever and continuous vomiting occur; and perhaps the patient's belly swells up and perhaps they vomit pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	So if you see that [the condition] persists, then know that it is a loss, and often such a person dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	## On the Reduction of Shoulder Dislocation and the End of the Humerus
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furca (sternum) does not usually dislocate inwardly from its attachment to the chest due to its own continuity with the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it becomes dislocated sometimes towards the outer parts, and that is made known to the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then it constricts the space with the strong contraction of your palm, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster over it, and bandages, and tighten it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	Indeed, its extremities that follow the cubit, and continue with it, do not dislocate unless rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	Which, if it becomes dislocated on some day: then it is necessary to bring it back and adjust it according to what we said, and what you have prepared.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster over it, and bandages, and tighten it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And especially instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the extremity of the shoulder is brought back, even when it has been separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the Reduction of a Dislocation of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	**Chapter XXVII**
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder (humerus) does not dislocate except according to three modes.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of these three modes, one is when it (the humerus) dislocates towards the lower part of the arm (tittlicus).
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second mode is when it (the humerus) dislocates towards the chest (pectoris).
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it (the humerus) dislocates towards the upper part of the shoulder: and that is rare.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it (the humerus) does not dislocate towards the back due to the scapula (spatula).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it (the humerus) does not dislocate towards the front due to nerves (neruos).
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed, it (the humerus) most often dislocates and emerges towards the lower part of the arm (tittlicus), especially in those whose muscles are few.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it (the humerus) emerges rapidly in those cases, and enters rapidly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	However, in those whose flesh is abundant, the opposite is found, namely that it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that they suffer a blow or an accident, and the humerus is displaced by heat and pressure, and this is thought to be due to that fact that it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you experience this, until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And dislocation is recognized when it is directed towards the inferior aspect of the joint: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will notice a clear difference, and in the head of the humerus you find concavity, and at the touch, the head of the humerus feels as if it is hollow: and the infirm person cannot bring their hand back to their ear, nor move it with all its motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, then you will notice a clear sensation, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And this dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent or if the patient is a young child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is such that it lifts the surgeon's hand towards the higher parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under the skin, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place; and the surgeon lifts his hand and extends it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he places it inferiorly, for it returns quickly by itself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If, however, it does not return as I have said, and there have been many days since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an application made which softens and soothes, as if roots of hemlock, fennel, and melilot were steeped in water and applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient should be turned over on his back, and under the skin a ball and wool should be placed which is equal between relaxation and tension.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place his heel on the ball and raise the head of the humerus with strength, and pull the patient's hand towards the lower parts.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another assistant should hold the patient's head to prevent it from moving downwards; for it returns immediately by itself.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you see this, reduce it according to this method: and it is such that you make the present man who is longer than the patient, and stands on the side, and inserts his arm under the skin of the patient; and he lifts the skin of the patient upwards until the patient is hanging in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant should pull the hand of the patient towards the lower parts of his abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	However, if the patient is weak: then something else should be suspended with him so as to weigh himself; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another mode; and there is a long piece of wood placed on the ground, whose head is round like a mortar's handle, not too thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then soft cloths should be placed under the patient after they are put on top of the wood, and the patient should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand should be extended towards the lower part on the other side, and his body should be stretched from the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and take a piece of wood whose length is the amount of two arms, and its breadth the amount of four fingers, and its thickness the amount of two fingers; and it should have a round head to facilitate entry into the deep wound according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths should be placed over the round head to prevent them from hurting the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Next, it should be placed under the lower bandage so that the hand or arm can be extended over the wood until the lower parts: and the wood is bound above the aid and the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Next, the arm should be placed on the step of the ladder according to its width, and the hand should be extended towards the lower parts, and the rest of the body is suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The incision is entered immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When, therefore, the entrance is completed in any way possible: then it is necessary to place under the bandage a sphere of equal quantity made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Next, apply the prepared plaster from ground flour with frankincense and egg white over the whole arm as required above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Next, tighten the bandage properly; and the ligature should be placed over the plaster above: and the hand is attached to the neck and released, so that the hand does not move for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to give light food to the sick person until the member is strengthened, for it is more expedient for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Next, after seven or five days, a larger one should be placed and withdrawn with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is strengthened and not softened, then healing has already occurred.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the suture is dislocated several times due to the moisture that has occurred or for another reason, then it should be treated with cautery using three incisions, as mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all these things are done, and the ligament is released after seven days, but the joint is not strengthened, and the bandage and compression are not applied repeatedly, but it does not firm up, and falls, and cannot be raised to its original position, then you should know that the nerves leading to the shoulder head have been incised, or extended, or softened, and know that the joint will never be restored to its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	In the case of dislocation towards the chest and breast, or towards the rear, it is done with a push and extension using the hands until it returns and the remaining compression and care are administered until healing occurs.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If this happens after healing, a serious condition in the limb, and there is delay in its motion, then the patient should use the bath repeatedly until that gravity is relaxed and it returns to its natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	**On the treatment of elbow dislocation.**
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the cubitus (elbow) dislocates with difficulty, and likewise returns with difficulty; and it itself dislocates to all parts, and especially to the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it falls under strain and under touch, according to whatever shape it takes.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated cubitus with the healthy one, that becomes clearly apparent to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The joint is then restored, and the arm cannot be doubled or touched with its own humerus.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary, as soon as you notice the dislocation, to act properly and reduce it before a hot swelling occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot swelling occurs, it becomes difficult to reduce the dislocation, and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is in the back parts.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	It is the worst of all types of dislocations, and brings with it more intense pain, and often ends in death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is as if you extend your hand with both hands: and the arm is spread out, and the doctor's hand is above the cubitus and beneath it, and he pushes the joint back with his thumb or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Now, true dislocation is to the front: then it returns so that it doubles the hand with its own hand, until it strikes with the root of its palm the cubit that is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not obey and refuses to reduce, then apply a firm, steady extension: it should be as if two assistants extend the arm, with two other assistants holding it in place so that it does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is reduced to its original position after a double cloth or a broad ligament has been applied over it and secured on top of the hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil so that it becomes one of the substances aiding in the ease and smoothness of the joint's movement.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the joint firmly until it returns to its original position.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, a compress should be placed on it containing a substance with a constricting and drying effect, and then the wound should be bound tightly with a suitable bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the neck by a sling, and it should be left for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be removed.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If, therefore, the union is firm in its place, then loosen the ligament from it and release the same.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the union does not hold well, then repeat the application of the plaster and the bandage, and release it after a few days until it holds firmly.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	However, if there is a serious condition after the reduction of the union and the arrangement is in motion: then apply humidification in the bath, and gentle friction, and compression until it heals, or place a pad over the joint, that is, a thick woolen napkin.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it, and release it over it for day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it and immerse it in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When, therefore, it has sweated, then gently friction the union with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over the joint the application of the compress once, twice, and thrice with each bath entry, until it softens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you see, place over it a warm, moist, butter-soaked compress and tighten over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It also relaxes and returns to its original position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	§ On the treatment of dislocation by Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Albucasis states that the hand can be dislocated several times, that is, the joint which connects the arm to the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of this dislocation at the time when it occurs, before the place shifts; otherwise, heat occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of this dislocation is as follows: place the patient's weakened hand on a table and have them extend their arm; the physician should then place their palm on top of the joint and push it until it returns to its original position.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider that if the palm has already receded into the hand, then the patient should place the back of their hand on the table at the time of extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of the patient's hand should be such that the inner part of their hand lies on the table, so that the physician's hand can be placed over the entire joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, it is good; if not, then tighten it with a drying plaster to stop the gap, and release it, without repeating that process.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you reduce it further after several days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its crookedness, and it does not harm the patient except that the hand becomes soft, and it cannot tighten anything, then know that the nerves are severed or chafed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, there is no skill in it other than to tighten it with a plaster near the affected area.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not bring about any change.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When, therefore, it does not return as Almahassem described, then apply to it the plaster that we have mentioned.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it should be tightened and released for five days; after that, it should be loosened and released, and the hand exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If, however, its movement is restricted and something grave happens to it, then loosen it with warm water and several friction movements until it becomes relaxed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	**On the treatment of finger dislocation.**
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from its joint, whether towards the side or back of the palm, or in between its joints: then stretch out your finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns to its place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and hang it towards the side on which it is dislocated, and leave it in that position for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang it up and stretch it out until it becomes straight in that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When evening comes, bind it according to the aforementioned description; and do not cease to loosen it during the day; and exercise it with motion; and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And likewise, if it is dislocated towards the joint of the hand, bind it to that side, and perform your first treatment on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And likewise, do the same when it is dislocated towards other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	**On the cure for spine joint dislocation.**
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When someone suffers from a complete dislocation of the spine or neck, or when many vertebrae are removed from their positions, then there is no cure for it, as death is approaching the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sick person's strength departs without their will, and they cannot hold it; and often some of his members become weak from it, or both his legs, or both his arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is removed, which often leads to its separation into four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, what is removed towards the rear is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment for it is that you consider when Gibbosity occurs from childhood; then there is no cure for it, nor is there any recovery at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	However, in cases that occur from an accident, or a blow, or similar ones, the ancient ways of treatment have been extensively discussed.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Most of which do not return with a successful outcome.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have indeed now abbreviated from that one, of which I excused but little from its proximity to me for the sake of intent, and through my exposition I revealed it, and formed its instrument in a different manner from what was shown, and they exhibited themselves.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore, I say that the gibbousness that occurs from the previous part is not a skill, nor is there healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly, that which is done regarding the two sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not healed from them, unless what happens in their own back, as I am telling: and it is, as the infirm extends himself over his face on an equal platform near the wall; and a moist cloth is spread under him, so that his chest is not hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight wood should be placed fixed into the fire on the ground, at the foot's end, around his head; and another wood around his feet at the other foot's end; and the assistant should hold the wood, and it should not be secured in the fire.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another assistant should hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then cover the patient's head and under his limbs gently tighten the ligature, making it firm; and extend the limb of the ligature to the wood that is near his head, and bind him to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another ligament above its branches, and above the knee of the same limb, and near its roots.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then join all the ligaments, and tie those threads to another stick that is near its feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then stretch every instrument to the part of the stick that it belongs to, and do not move the two sticks from their places where they are fixed; however, they are not yet secure, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician should place his palms firmly on the spine until it returns, or place a board on top of it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he attaches his feet above the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not return after this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three arm-lengths.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And cause the wall, as we said, which is near the weak part where the end of the board will enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the physician should place his feet on the other end of the board.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And it should be drawn tight until the spine is bent, and then return to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then, if necessary, operate with a knife that is inserted by your hand: and it is as if you fix two wooden pieces to the ground near the head of the patient at the final joint of the foot, whose length is the arm's breadth; and near its head, two wooden pieces.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And its length is one palm between each wood; and now a hole has been made at every place where the knife runs: and all the wood is firmly fixed to the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round wood should be inserted; and the knife is where the ligament revolves in two holes of two woods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole where the wood is fixed, whose length is one palm with what it revolves; and in the other two woods, likewise, it is the same.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments that you have tightened in the chest with a knife that is near its head; and the ligaments that you have tightened in its legs with a knife that is near its feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand near every knife that is moving, and help it with a strap with which the hand turns; and the doctor adjusts the spine, as we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the knife, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after it has returned to its original state and the area is equalized, you should then place a dry plaster with albumen on it.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, remove the plaster.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	After that, place a frame made of wood above the plaster, whose width is three fingers, or approximately that size.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should be such that it covers the area of the hunch and extends beyond the healthy part of the spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the ligature that we have mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient should be given delicate food until they are healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If there remains anything of prominence in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, along with the application of a board as we described in time past.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now the lead sheet is administered in that place.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when there occurs a prominence in the final spine of the back: and it is thought to be due to dislocation, and that bone has already emerged.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why should this medicine be used with such presumption? For it may very well lead to death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	**On the treatment of a displaced anchor.**
Caput XXXII.	**Head XXXII.**
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the dislocation of an anchor and the dislocation of the shoulder only occurs if there is a dislocation, not because of minor removal or slight indentation.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed, the anchor joint dislocates according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	This is because it dislocates towards the front and back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed, it dislocates most towards the inside, and only slightly towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment for its dislocation towards the inside is as follows: because when you connect a healthy leg to an injured one, it takes longer; and the knee of the injured party sticks out more than that of the healthy one, and he cannot bend his foot at the hip; and there is a place that follows the hip joint's extension, warm due to the head of the thigh bone having already reached that point.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of one who has suffered a dislocation towards the exterior is that it is contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one who has suffered a dislocation towards the front is that it extends the healthy leg to its full extent; however, it does not double up without pain in the knee. If it tries to walk, it cannot move beyond this dislocation towards the front, and urine retention occurs, the groin becomes inflamed, and during walking there is pressure on the heel bone.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of one who has suffered a dislocation towards the back is that it does not extend the leg and cannot double up until the groin becomes stiff; and his leg is also shorter on the affected side, and the groin is relaxed, and the acetabulum (hip joint) becomes painful in the region of the ilium (a bone in the pelvis).
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this type of dislocation is to consider at that time, if the dislocation is old, which has already become ancient with its having been present for a long time.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you perform the reduction and it remains according to its position, then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore one should not make a complete assumption about it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the case where the dislocation is recent and belongs to one of the four types of dislocations, then act promptly to restore the joint, extending it towards the interior and exterior, moving it to the right and left; perhaps it will reduce on its own, and no other treatment will be needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, this does not happen in the aforementioned manner, then one must prepare a strong assistant, and stretch his leg from its lower part, either by hand or with a bandage that is tied above his knee; and another assistant should extend his hand over it, so as to insert his hands beneath the folds of his skin.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie a soft bandage over the root of the thigh, and hold the end of the other bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And the extension should be either from the front part of the groin to the part of the fork (femoral triangle), or from the back part to the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And all these extensions should be done once until the patient is lifted from the ground with his body and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is the common type for all four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If, therefore, the dislocation returns with what we said, it is good; but if not, then every kind of that which I say concerning its own cure is necessary.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of it, when the dislocation is towards the inner parts, the patient must be turned over on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should place the bandage over the root of the thigh, where it is between the head of the thigh and the space under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he extends the ligament upwards from the groin region to the higher part of the body, towards the fork (of the femur).
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then he should take another strong helper at his side, and reduce the large space of the weak hip joint, and extend it with a firm outward push.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	I am returning to my place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this is the easier kind of treatment for reducing this member.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, it pulls away from you and does not obey this treatment with this kind of cure at all, then you should bind both weak feet together with a strong and flexible ligament, above the two calves and above the two knees; and each should be of a length equal to the distance between four fingers, and the weak leg should be extended more than the other by the measure of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weak one should be suspended over the top of the wooden beam, which is in the house; and its length should be from the ground equal to the distance between two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then you should strongly instruct the young and strong one to reinforce the hip joint; and suspend another weak one with the strong one; and push the strong one, reinforcing the hip joint with strength, for the connection returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In his own version, however, when there is a dislocation towards the outer parts, it is necessary that the patient lies on a bed, as we have described in the case of kyphosis.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the ligaments should be tied above his leg, on his weak side, and also above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two sticks are placed, one near his feet and the other near his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a wooden plank is placed across the middle of the bed, securely fixed; over which wet cloths are spread to prevent discomfort to the patient, and another plank is positioned between his legs to prevent him from sliding downwards when he extends himself.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then every helper should extend his arm to his own side, and the doctor should adjust the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If, therefore, he obeys the reversal, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if he does not obey the reversal, then place another board on top of him and press it equally as we described for kyphosis.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the patient lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is towards the front parts, then it is necessary that the weak leg be quickly extended; and this is according to the same account on the bed: and the physician should place his right hand's palm upon the sick side's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then it narrows itself with the other hand, and with that constriction, place it extended downwards towards the lower part of the leg.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is towards the rear parts: then it is not necessary that the weak leg be extended downwards and raised above the ground; on the contrary, it should be placed upon a hard surface, as is done even when its wide dislocation is towards the exterior, according to what we said about its position upon two surfaces: and it should be on its face, with its ligaments extended: according to what we recently said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And compression should be applied with a board upon the place towards which the joint is extending, when its reduction is completed according to necessity.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction should not escape you: and it is as if you stretch both the weak legs; and when you see them equal, and the sick one squeezes his leg and extends it without help, then you know that the member has already returned according to necessity; then join the two thighs, and put a plaster, and tie with a bandage, that is, a splint: so that it does not move widely towards any parts; and let him remain quiet for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then he loosens the ligament and the plaster, and compares the leg with the other. If you see that both are in the same position, then know that the dislocation is now stable; so absolve the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any sign of softening: then return to it, and apply that plaster, and tighten it according to your first strain; and release it even after three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then he loosens it and makes the healing process take its course for several days on each leg until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	§ On the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee joint can be dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It can be dislocated outwardly, inwardly, and downward, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate towards the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you should urge the patient to put his leg against his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of dislocation is that you make the infirm sit straight, so that he can extend his leg if possible over it, and your back adheres to its face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make the knee adhere with your palms, and place them straight between your fingers on top of the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of the knee firmly.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another assistant should extend his leg until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh gently, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply a hot compress, and make the leg adhere to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together at the same time for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then untie them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the invalid should not be made to walk for several days until they are healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, reducing it is refused to you, then apply a strong extension with the ligaments, of which mention has previously been made in the treatment of the ankle, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	§ On the treatment of calcaneal dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXII.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes dislocated by a slight movement, and sometimes it is dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you will see the calcaneus swollen, proceeding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its reduction is easy, and it is as if it were extended with ease by the hands and adjusted until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In its treatment, however, when it is dislocated completely, you should make the invalid sit straight and have a strong helper hold him firmly from behind, in the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold his foot with your right hand from its upper part and with your left hand from the lower part of the toe.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left hand, use two instruments.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend your left hand and push the foot's chest with your right hand towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the foot's chest towards the leg in the third instance, and pull out the toe.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore, it returns to the first instance or to both according to this manner and you see the foot equalised, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on it, for it itself returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, you are prevented from its return as we have described, then lay the sick person down on his back on the ground and fix a very firm blanket on the ground between his legs so that he falls there, and you have already covered him with a cloth so as not to hurt the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then the attendant should take hold of the patient's coccyx; afterwards, another attendant extends the patient's foot, or with his hands, or with a bandage that he binds around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then every attendant should extend against the extension of his counterpart; and a pillow should be placed between the two weak thighs to prevent his body from tilting downwards during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician should reduce the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant should hold the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	The dislocation returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When the dislocation returns and its restoration is declared to you, then apply a plaster and poultice, firmly bind it with ligaments, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And you must be careful not to harm or fear the nerves that are above the heel behind, so as not to put pressure on them and cause injury.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let it be left for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament becomes softer, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he attempts to walk before that space is closed, there is no security but that a dislocation occurs over it, and it is corrupted, and does not receive healing afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a fever occurs in him: then it is necessary that you administer to his sedative that which our previous narrative mentioned elsewhere concerning treatment, and friction, until the fever is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	**On the dislocation of toes and its treatment**
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXIV
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what has dislocated from them with a slight extension without effort be adjusted; and this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	However, if the dislocation is in any knots of the foot's back: then it is necessary that the weak foot be made to sit on an equal place to the ground, or on a board: and it stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand, and place your foot on whatever sticks out from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with strength until it returns, and you perceive that it is now equal, and there appears no eminence at the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under his foot a board which will take the whole foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten the tight binding for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it completely, and make him rest from walking for many days, until he is bound and secured by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	§ On the kinds of dislocation with the elbow or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	HEAD XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens from it, and you attempt its cure and restoration, often death follows, and for that reason, one should not presume over its cure of this kind, unless he is prudent in the art, merciful, pious, slow, not audacious, nor presumptuous, and use only initial medicines which provide only a slight warmth: and let the sick be released by divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you understand, or hope for salvation from ruin with the gentleness of illness, and where something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, strive for the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot apoplectic attack occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If the member returns to its normal state, as we desire, then administer treatment to calm the swelling: and treat the wound with what is appropriate for it from dried ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If there is a dislocation with a fracture, and the segments of the bone are separated, then try to remove them, and do what we said about simple illnesses from what preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be brave according to your strength, and guard yourself from the entrance of fear: as my previous prediction to you said.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more beneficial to your body among them in your time.
