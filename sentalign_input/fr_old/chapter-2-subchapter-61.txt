of the stone in women
It rarely happens that a stone forms in women, and if it happens sometimes, the treatment is difficult, and is hindered by three things: one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin; and the second is that one cannot find a woman willing to expose herself to doctors, especially if she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-versed in this art with her hands; and the fourth reason is that the woman's stone is deeper than the man's stone, which requires a deeper cut, and there is great fear.
And if necessity compels this, then you must find a skilled female doctor, and it is difficult to find one, and if you cannot find one, then seek a chaste, subtle male doctor; and present him with a wise old woman knowledgeable in women's lives, or a woman who knows part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command regarding the search for the stone;
and examine very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the anus and search for the stone; and if she finds it, then press it under her finger, and instruct her to insert her finger into the woman's vagina, and search and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, then she must move it little by little from the entrance of the bladder to below, until it comes to the root of the thigh; then cut over the stone at the root of the thigh towards the middle of the vulva, where it is better positioned, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and make the first cut small;
then insert the probe into the cut, if you feel the stone then enlarge the wound so that the stone can come out, and know that there are many types of stones: namely, small and large and rough and smooth, long and round, and with roots. know their characteristics to understand the extraction.
And if the blood overcomes you, then apply powdered vitriol to the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped; then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments I mentioned for the extraction of stones in men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, then apply the powder to the place and compress with tents and bandages, and do not repeat this, and leave the stone and do not extract it, because the patient might die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is soothed, and the place is healed, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
