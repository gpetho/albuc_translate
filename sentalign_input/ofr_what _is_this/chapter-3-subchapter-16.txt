of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, one of which is rightly called "tibia", and the other is called "fibula"; and fractures occur just as they do in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is all there.  And if both bones are broken together, the leg turns in all directions.
And if the slender bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, great pain is felt, and it is easily seen; and it turns underneath/inward.
Then apply traction, and set it evenly, and tie the splints evenly; but nevertheless, if the fracture is severe, and there are multiple pieces, the traction must be less and lighter; and adjust according to your skill. 
And when you have completed all your work, take two curved wooden boards that enclose the leg on either side, and they should be the length of the leg from the knee down; then wrap a bandage over it in two places, above and below, and tie it in the middle too, and with this binding the leg will not be able to bend to the right or left, and thus it is good; and some apply a cradle the length of the leg, and it is made of wood, and the leg is placed in it to prevent movement, and this is done especially in a fracture where there is a wound; and move the leg every day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; treat it until it is healed.
