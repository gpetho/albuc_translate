O you, my very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine along with its completion, and have made its end through its expositions and declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say "surgery."
And because the work of hands is withdrawn in our region and is completely foreign, thus the science is perished and cut off, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that hands have changed. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are closed and science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I wish to revive it together with the organization of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and of abbreviation; and I will come with the forms of iron instruments for cautery, and of other instruments of the work with the addition of declaration and preparation of it, as is needed.
And for the reason that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distanced. And it behooves one who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so much that he knows the arrangement of members, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of bones and nerves and arms and their number, and the movement and of moving veins and resting ones, and of their place of origin.
And for this Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the aforementioned things should take care that he does not fall into error and that he does not kill men;
thus I have seen many times several of those who undertake this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut an aposteme of scrofula on a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; wherefore so much blood came out that the woman fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another physician who extracted a stone from a man of age, and the stone was large; thus he carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man was dead within 3 days.
And I had already been called there to extract it, and saw the disposition of the patient and the size of the stone, and knew well if one cut him he would die.
And I saw another physician who took into care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break had a wound;
and the physician full of ignorance tightened the break over the wound with splints by strong binding, and did not leave any opening for the wound, and left it thus for a time;
and commanded him not to unbind it;
and remained thus that the leg became all swollen and the foot and came to perdition.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come unbind the leg; And when I had untied it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
However, the corruption was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was completely lost.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and then it became inflamed due to his poor treatment.
For cancer, when it is purely from melancholic humor, one should not touch it with iron unless it is in such a place where one can completely remove what is corrupted.
And for this, dearest son, you need to know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in multiple situations;
and I will show in each part of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore it is necessary that you take care, so that foolish physicians cannot speak ill of you.
Take up your instruments with care, and treat your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that by God's grace you may come to success and be praised;
and leave the frightening diseases of difficult healing;
and remove your instruments from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: "Do not take on the treatment of a bad disease, lest you be called a foolish physician."
I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is about cauterization by fire and cauterization by strong medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head to the feet;
and about the forms of instruments, and the iron tools for cauterization, and about all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and about cupping glasses and wounds, and about the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and includes the forms of instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and it is ordered from the head to the feet, and about the forms of instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of help and harm of each complexion.
I say that the quality of help and harm is the longest discourse and subtle science and hidden secrets;
and many of the wise spoke of this, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear lengthiness.
I say that cauterization helps universally for every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions: that is to say hot complexion without matter, and dry complexion without matter.
In hot and dry complexion together with matter, some divided and said that cauterization is of great help; and others said the contrary: that cauterization is not worth anything for illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and one must not cure a hot illness with heat, nor with dryness;
and he who said the contrary says that cauterization provides great help for hot and dry illness that comes in men's bodies. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it sometimes through experiment.
And yet, none should undertake it except those who have tested it, and who know through long practice the chapter on cauterizations, and the diversity of men's constitutions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the span of time;
for other constitutions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist diseases. And all physicians gathered and agreed on cauterization.
And know, son, that cauterization with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cauterization with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and only affects the member that is cooked, and hardly harms any other member.
Burning medicines travel from member to member at a distance, and bring to the member diseases difficult to heal; and by chance kill the patient.
Fire, by its nobility and by the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experiment and through the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and stayed upon the truth of things;
and for this I excuse myself for the length of speech, for it does not please me to hide from you the secret that is contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it drives away diseases from bodies, as the philosopher says in demonstration; now receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on what time cauterizations should be done, and chose spring.
And I say that cauterization is suitable in all seasons, because the occurring harm is subdued by the help of cauterization; and especially if the cauterizations are for severe and urgent necessary pains that cannot wait for the time lest greater malice come to the member.
And never think, dear son, as do foolish physicians; for the disease that is healed by cauterization has no return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not as they believe, because cauterization is nothing but medicine that changes the constitution, and dries the humors that are the cause of pain, and works better than medicine due to the hastiness of its value, and due to the virtue of its work and its lordship.
And it is possible that the disease comes sometimes according to the constitution of the patient and the location of the disease and its strength;
and superfluities are gathered in it through the acquisition of foods and similar things, unless cauterization is administered in a place where there are few superfluities and moisture, such as cauterization of teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cauterization is called the last of medicine, and this is true;
but they do not believe that cauterization works after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cauterization is the last of medicine because when we administer types of cures in some disease and they do not work, then we administer the cauterization, and it works.
Thus it appears well that cauterization is the last of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish physicians.
The ancients said that cauterization with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the nobility of its substance;
and they said that the place of cauterization does not make rot, but this is not true for I have tested it, and have found that this is true in some men;
and cauterization with gold works better than with iron, as they said. When you heat a gold instrument, you cannot tell when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools down quickly;
and if one heats it too much; they melt in the fire; and thus there are many impediments.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to feet, so that the path may be easier to find.
This cautery is effective for moisture and cold on the brain, and there are two that are made for a disease called "soda," and for various humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for numerous dreams and tooth pain and throat pain, and especially for all diseases that come from cold such as paralysis and deafness and apoplexy and similar diseases.
The method of this cautery is that the patient should be purged by purgative medicine cleansing the head for 3 or 4 nights, according to what the strength and age and constitution of the patient can bear; and then have the patient's head shaved.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and put his hands on his chest;
after put the base of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle finger comes, mark with ink then heat the cautery which is called "olivare," of which here is the form: And put it on the spot marked with ink, and move downward while tightening your hand little by little while turning; then quickly lift your hand, and look at the spot to see if you can see the bone a tiny bit; and if you don't see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I told you;
then take a little salt, and put it in water and wet cotton in it, and put it on the spot, and leave it for 3 days;
after put cotton soaked in butter on it; and leave it on until the burn is removed; after treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon," until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it purges; and therefore it helps better.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery until part of the bone is burnt, and then scrape what is burnt from the bone, and let it be treated.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on, and push so hard that one removes from the bone an area as wide as a spindle whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors may better come out;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time; after one should treat it and close it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be entirely good, except in some men where there is a path of fear;
and it seems better to me that I should leave it;
for the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other members;
and especially when the patient's head is naturally weak, and the first appearance of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it then together with health.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient must use iris and pills that are called "cochie", and purging of the head and oils and plasters; and if one applies the cautery that we mentioned before, and it doesn't work. Take note if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize below that cautery a little that we mentioned above. After that make a cautery on each corner of the head down to the bone, as we said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "vessels"; and it is a place where one puts cupping glasses; and steady your hand so that you do not go down to the bone: the patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the corners be more subtle than those used to cauterize the middle of the head, and this is the form:
about the cautery of the head When sudden pain comes to one part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged by cleansing medicines, and one has done the other treatments that I mentioned in the division of illnesses, and all this doesn't help: then make cauteries according to two methods, that is to say with sharp medicine and with iron.
The cautery with sharp medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and remove the skin and cut it a little at both ends, and then split the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can hide the clove of garlic under the skin;
and when it will be hidden then bind it and tighten it well and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then unbind it and pull out the clove of garlic, and leave the wound thus for two or three days; then put cotton soaked in butter on it until pus comes out.
After that treat it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want you can do this with some burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise about burning medicines.
The iron cautery is according to this method. Heat the cautery of which here is the form:
And it is called "nail" because the head is made in the form of a nail where there is a little curve, and in the middle there is a small protrusion;
and put it on the painful place, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the skin is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery that is outside doesn't burn, and abundant blood flows.
After put cotton in salt water, and put it on the place for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want cauterize this migraine with the cautery that is called "knife-like", with the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine that is not old.
about migraine
When you treat migraine as we have said before in divisions of illnesses, and it doesn't help, and you see that the aforementioned cauteries of medicine and iron are not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery that is called "knife-like" until it is white;
and first mark on the painful place a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and tighten it so that you don't cut the artery and that you don't go down to the bone;
and be careful of the mandible that moves when one eats, and the nerve has no regard that moves it and that spasm doesn't come to the patient, and be careful of blood flow from the artery when it will be cut, or cutting has great fear and especially to one who doesn't know about it, and who isn't studied and experienced; and leave the work halfway;
but I will tell you how one stops blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you at the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is tolerant, cauterize the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter about arterial extraction, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
On ear pain from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and one has worked with dissolving medicines and other treatments that we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not move, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which here is the form:
After that, make points all around the sick ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and stay a little away from the root of the ear after you have marked the place with ink; and make 10 points around each ear;
afterwards treat the area until it is healed.
On the twisting of the mouth
Twisting that must be treated by cautery is only that which comes from phlegm, as we have said in the division of illnesses;
and do not apply cautery to conditions that come from dryness and nerve spasms.
When you treat this type of twisting that comes from phlegm of hydras and purging of the head and gargling, and this doesn't work, then you must cauterize the patient with 3 cauteries: one at the root of the ear, another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and put the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery right at the head of the ear above a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half the core is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the knife-like one that we showed before, but it is a bit more subtle and the blade should be a bit thicker;
afterwards treat the area as I said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it doesn't help, and the patient doesn't have fever, then make 4 cauteries: Two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place called "vessels" as we said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be treated as we have said before.
On lethargy
For this illness one must give the patient large doses and pills that purify the brain;
after shaving the patient's head completely, put on the occiput the mustard plaster that is written in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of the cautery: make it as I have said.
If he is healed this way, good; and if he isn't, make 3 cauteries from the middle of the head going down to the neck, and leave the space of one thick finger between each cautery;
and treat it like the others, and if you want to add more, and the patient is tolerant, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two horns, and treat until healed;
and let the cautery be the one called "olivare," as I said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of veins and of what we have mentioned before;
after shaving the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each corner, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you have more need, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is strong, then make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave it until most of the flesh is burned, and lift your hand; afterwards treat it until it is healed, and let the cautery be the one called "olivare" that we have mentioned before.
On epilepsy
The epileptic should not use cautery except for one who is phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to cleanse the brain of veins and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is grown and able to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot bear it, then give him gargarism and mastication cleansing the brain often with good foods;
after shaving his head in the middle, and make one cautery according to what we have said before, and one cautery on the vessel, and on each corner; and if the patient is strong and suffering, then make cauteries as I have said to the one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner I have said.
If the patient is a child, then make one subtle cautery according to this manner:
When due to melancholy the superfluities or moistures are corrupted and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with such cauteries as we have said for the one who has paralysis.
And if due to melancholy the superfluity is declining to melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain will be cleansed, according to what is before in the division.
After shave the head of the patient; after make a well-made linen ring, like a circle, and put it in the middle of the head;
and let the patient sit crossed, and be well held from all sides;
after present the liniment, and sheep's butter that is old is better; and heat it on fire moderately, so that the finger if one puts it in can bear it; after empty the circle from within in the middle of the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient each week once with other good governance, until he is healed.
Or if you wish cauterize it by making several points with all the cautery.
This manner of cautery moistens the brain equally;
and then put on cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
On water in the eyes When water first comes to the eyes by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and guard him from all moistures, and make him sweat in the bath several times while fasting.
After command him to shave his head, and make cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of water is in both eyes together, or in one if the descent is in one;
and cut with all the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the flesh, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple;
and guard yourself from blood flow, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stanch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution how you will stanch it;
and sometimes one makes cautery in the nape below the two rear bones.
and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then apply the cautery that I mentioned at the beginning for the water descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries on the nape below the two bones; and if more is needed, then cauterize carefully above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient drink for three nights at bedtime; afterwards shave their head, and make a cautery in the middle with the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and be careful not to cut the artery.
And this is the form of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery that is called "olivare." of which here is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until a third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner I have described.
About hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyes turn inward, and prick the eye, and cauteries are made according to two methods: that is to say by fire, or by burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, command the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even; and if they prick at their growth, hold the eyes closed so they don't move while they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your lap; after, mark on the eyelid a figure that is like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be next to the hairs;
then put cotton soaked in egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
After, cauterize over the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the flesh is burned there;
and the sign of the health of the work is that you see the eyelid retracted, and the hairs raised from pricking the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it thus for three days, then put cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed; after, treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after this the hairs come back, and the eyelid is softened then restart the cautery on the same place, as you did at first;
and if the hair is outside, cauterize it until the eyelid is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you command the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take French soap and quicklime, one ounce of each, and grind together well; and do it hastily, so that it does not cool, then spread it over the form that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid; and if the disease is in one eye only, one should work on one, and if in both then likewise; and put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white;
and let the head of the patient be in your lap and put your index finger on the medicine, and press a little and move it every time the patient feels burning from the medicine, for they feel burning as if from fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the stinging has passed, wash the area with water, and observe if you see the eyelid raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is good.
If not, put more of the medicine on the place where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are set right;
then put cotton soaked in butter until the burnt flesh falls off, afterwards treat the area with the ointment that is called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you watch your work very carefully so that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the eyelid becomes soft afterwards, and the hair pricks the eye, restart the medicine on that place of the eyelid that has softened, just as you did before; afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that men's eyes are different in size, both large and small, and according to this should be your constraints;
and the right way should not be hidden from one who studies this art.
on the cure of fistula by cautery
When you treat fistula as we have said in the division of diseases, and your treatments do not profit, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in this manner.
Command the patient to put his head in your lap; and have the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he does not move, nor shake his head;
then put cotton soaked in egg white or in parsley juice on the eye;
then heat the cautery which is like this:
and is hollowed at the end like the form of a small bolt, together with which is the cautery;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a probe;
but nevertheless, this one that is hollowed works better for your operation.
After pressing the fistula if it is open, and drawing out the pus, and drying it; and if it is closed, open it, and draw out the matter;
then put on the very hot cautery, and hold your hand on the cautery on the side of the nerve away from the eye, so that your hand does not make a mistake; and put the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you come to the beginning of the cautery until the bone, it will be good. If not, restart the cautery once more, and another if you need it, and leave it for 3 days;
afterwards put on cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if 40 days pass and it is not healed, put on sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered; and scrape it according to what will come in its chapter.
And there is a manner of cautery for fistula that some of the ancients spoke of. Pay attention to the fistula, and split the place; then put in the split a subtle camahan of which here is the form: and make it to the quantity of one .З. of lead; and hold your hand on the camahan firmly, and let not the patient move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary to put on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water:
the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have spoken of, that is good. If not, it is necessary to administer holes to the nerve, and bring back the fistula to the body of the nerve according to what is necessary in its proper place.
About cracks in lips: Very often cracks occur in lips that are called "hair," and especially in children's lips.
When you treat these cracks with what we have mentioned in divisions, and the treatment doesn't help, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly in these cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards treat the area with wax until it is healed.
When an abscess comes in the root of the mouth or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it creates pus and breaks and becomes old and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in divisions, and it doesn't help: then you need to have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after insert it in the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its bottom, and the furthest place;
and do this once or twice, after treat it with what we have mentioned in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed this way, that's good; and if not, then it's necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth become loose, and you treat it with medicines and that doesn't work, then put the patient's head in your lap; after heat the cautery whose form will come after in such a way that you put a tube over the tooth;
and put inside the hot cautery quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat coming to the root of the tooth;
after lift your hand and restart the cautery according to your will;
after let the patient fill their mouth with salted water, and hold it for an hour and spit it out.
And in such a way the tooth that was moving becomes firm, and the softened gum tightened, and the corrupted moisture dried.
About tooth pain:
When tooth pain comes from cold, or there is cold indeed, and medical treatments don't work, then there is need for cautery in two ways: both butter cautery and fire cautery.
Butter cautery is such that you take cow's butter, and boil it in an iron or brass spoon; after take cotton and wrap it on the point of a probe, and dip it in boiled butter, and put it on the aching tooth quickly and hold until it cools;
and do this often until its power reaches the root of the tooth, and if you want, dip wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the fire reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take an iron or brass tube, and let it be thick so that the fire doesn't come to the patient's mouth;
after heat the cautery, whose form will come after, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And the patient should fill their mouth with good butter during the pressing of this cautery, and then spit it out;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And make a cautery from whichever end you want, and according to what you are able;
and this is the form of the tube:
About scrofula When scrofulas are from phlegm and cold humors, and are not responsive to treatment by medicines, then heat the hollow cautery of which the form comes hereafter, and it should have two openings for the vapors to exit from the cautery on the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for 3 days; and place cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold constitution, then it is necessary that the patient first be purged by purgative medicines;
afterwards make a cautery at the root of the throat, and be careful not to reach all the way to the throat, and burn only a little of the flesh.
Afterwards make another cautery at the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let it be the cautery that is called "clavicle" of which we have the form before;
and treat the area as we have said before until it is healed.
When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the disease is old, make two cauteries on the chest in empty places; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let it be the cautery that is called "clavicle" according to the form that is mentioned before.
And if you wish, make cautery by puncturing with the cautery that is called "points" of which the form is shown before in the treatment of ears;
and let the points be up to 30, or thereabouts.
Afterwards treat the area according to what was said before, and let the cautery be with 3 branches according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are easier, because you make 3 at once.
About dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and one puts it back in place, and it cannot stay but rather keeps coming out again with small movements that occur, as we have experienced, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation. Afterwards let the patient lie on his back and on his side; afterwards lift the flesh that is within the armpit with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inward, then heat the cautery that has 2 branches of which here is the form:
and cauterize the flesh until it pierces to the side, and the figure of the cautery will make 4 cauteries;
and for this reason cautery is made with the cautery that has 3 branches, whereby the figure of cauterization makes six cauteries;
and the branches are according to the thinness of a probe and this is the form of the cautery that has 3 branches:
And sometimes one branch is added to this whereby there are 8 cauteries.
Afterwards place on the cautery crushed leeks with salt; afterwards let the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which happens rarely, then make cautery on the thickness with the clavicle cautery, or many puncturing cauteries.
For the joint is secured, and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
When coldness and much moisture come into the stomach, such that they draw it from its natural state, and catarrhs multiply in it, and the customary ways of treatment do not profit, then the patient must lie on his back, and extend his legs and hands. After this, make three cauterizations: one below the breast bone at the distance of a finger, with the nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations outside the two sides so that the pattern of the cauterizations forms three angles, and leave such space between one and another that they do not join together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauterizations be so deep that they encompass two parts of the skin, and let the pattern of the cauterizations be according to this form without addition:
And if you want to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and for one who fears this cautery, cauterize by pricking and mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you want with ink; then cauterize it with the cautery that is called "points."
After that, treat it with the treatment that we had before, until it is healed.
When pain comes to the liver from cold and moisture and thick windiness, such that it is thrown out of its natural state by superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does not profit him, then the patient must lie on his back; and mark with ink three cauterizations according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, there where man's elbow comes;
and let there be space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauterizations be along the length of the body, and do not press your hand too much with the cautery;
and let only half the skin be burned, and let the patient stand on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if it is your will, cauterize these cauterizations with the knife-shaped cautery, if you are subtle and wise in the art, and guard yourself that you do not burn all the skin, for you would dry out the whole body; and that it does not come to the bowel, for the skin is very thin there, and know this for true.
When there is an aposteme in the liver, and you want to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain but not too strong;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels mad pain.
And when this treatment deceives the physicians, then the patient must lie on his back;
and then mark with ink the place where the aposteme is, and then heat the cautery that resembles a ray, of which here is the form: And cauterize one cautery until the skin is burned, and comes to the peritoneum, so that all the pus comes out;
after that, treat according to the treatment of exits until he is healed;
and it is not fitting that anyone use this cautery except one who has studied long in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these diseases have sometimes run.
Then he can work boldly, and nevertheless it seems to me that leaving it is better.
Of the cautery for pleurisy
The ancients said that one should make cauteries for pleurisy from aristolochia roots, and in this manner: take a root of long aristolochia, the largest that you can find, and let it be dry, and be as thick and as long as your finger; and moisten it in oil, and light it with fire, and cauterize one cautery between the collar bone and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower in the part that is below the beard;
and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, declining a bit backward; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another on the stomach, and one between the shoulders, and two on the two sides of the chest outside the cautery that is between the shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use an iron cautery similar to a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches this abscess; and the pain escapes outward, as we have said in [the section about] the abscess of the liver.
But in this operation there is fear that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops there that cannot be healed.
Of the spleen
When you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have said in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then three types of cautery are appropriate, all of which are good.
Of which one method is that you make 3 or 4 cauteries, in a line according to the length of the spleen, following the shape of the liver cautery that we mentioned before;
and do not press your hand too hard with the cautery, and let the patient lie supine on his back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery that has two prongs, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the skin that is over the spleen, where the patient's elbow comes toward the left, and let the elevation with which you lift the skin be according to the heart, along the length of the body, and let the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Then push in the two heated prongs until the skin is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four [holes].
And if you wish, cauterize with the three-pronged cautery.
Afterwards treat it when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this works better than the other treatments mentioned before.
Cautery is only valuable for dropsy in the type that is called "ascites."
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the navel, and one above the stomach, and one above the liver, and one above the spleen, and two behind the back on the spine, and one at the chest; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the skin.
Afterward leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not abandon the treatment of the patient after the cautery; and healing will hasten, and the two intentions will be achieved together with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the nail-shaped one that we showed before; and the one for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what was previously shown.
When the feet are swollen in one who has dropsy, and are full of yellow water, you should cauterize on the top of the foot between the little toe and the ring toe; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not go too deep, thus the yellow water will flow out, and let the cautery be according to this shape:
Then make two cauteries on the two legs, on each leg at the point of the knife-shaped tool; and let the cauteries be lengthwise, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treating, so that the water flows out;
afterwards treat with the other treatments that we have mentioned.
When looseness of bowels comes from cold and moisture, such that the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by usual methods; and you see the patient bearing it well and with strong constitution, make a large cautery on the stomach as discussed before in the section on stomach cautery, with the circular cautery; and 4 cauteries around the navel with a fine nail-like cautery, and 2 cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient bearing it, make a cautery on the pubic area, and one cautery on each flank, and 2 small cauteries on the stomach next to the large one, for the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance.
on the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, either one or several, and are old and are of thick cold and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in divisions, and it does not help, then make cauteries: 3 on the spine of the back, the one that is completely outside below the vertebra little by little in a triangular pattern, and 1 cautery two fingers below the navel;
and if you think his stomach is chilled, and food doesn't digest, and one sees the face swelling, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the nail-like cautery; and leave the cautery open for a long time. Afterward treat the area until it is healed.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and then put it all burning hot on this cut thelul; and keep your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein from which blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there are many thelul, cauterize each one as we have said; afterward treat them with beneficial ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the lower back, it will provide greater help.
When the patient cannot bear cutting or opening, which we will discuss in its place, such illness comes that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When someone gets a fistula, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupted moisture, you should probe it with a fine probe, and make sure you know with the probe how deep it is.
Afterward heat the razor-like cautery, and push it into the fistula according to the depth that the probe entered, and repeat the cautery until those putrid and corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice or thrice, according to the quantity needed;
and be careful not to burn the nerves that are there, and the large veins.
if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and to the intestine, be careful of these places, and don't do this except in fleshy areas, and consider that it is not piercing;
afterward treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed, and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed;
and if the matter is not removed, know that the area is perforated, and the bone is corrupted at the bottom; and thus like one of these that we will discuss in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from thick windiness, and one loses desire for women, then it is necessary that you make cauteries on the kidneys on both sides with the nail-like cautery that we mentioned before;
and if we cauterize in the middle, there will be 3 cauteries in a line, and they will provide greater help.
of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, such that the patient retains urine, then make a cautery on the outer part above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and one on the right and one on the left, and each cautery should be as long as a thumb's knuckle;
and make one cautery outside on the back, or two if you need them;
and the cautery should be nail-shaped according to the aforementioned form.
When the womb is cold and moist, and this does not prevent conception, and the menses are corrupted and their timing is delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary to make three cauteries around the navel, as we have said for the bladder cautery, and two cauteries outside on the back;
and the cautery should be nail-shaped, as we have said.
When viscous moistures descend to the hip socket, and because of this it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and the place of separation is found empty, it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the hip socket with a circular cautery, and mark beforehand the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is within the circle;
and the cautery should be like the one used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and the cautery should be as deep as the entire thickness of the flesh;
and treat it until it is healed.
of hip pain When pain comes to the hip socket, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment does not work, and the illness is old: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of thick humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. Afterwards make a cautery;
and the manner of cautery is according to two methods: that is to say together burning medicines, and cautery of fire.
Cautery of fire is according to many methods, of which one is such:
that you cauterize above the hip socket three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make good and great depth, and have between each cautery the space of a finger's width, and let the cautery be olive-shaped;
sometimes one makes a cautery in the middle above the head of the hip, which makes four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we mentioned before in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle contains the entire hip, and all the thickness of the flesh is burned.
And this is the method one uses in sciatica, when the pain stays in the hip, and does not reach to the thigh or to the leg.
And if it reaches to the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers' width, on the left side a little;
and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and let the thickness of the flesh be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes of the foot or near there, cauterize where he feels the pain with three or four points using the cautery called "points." And if necessary, make more of them;
and if he knows that the pain is below the knee toward the thigh, make a cautery with the knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take good care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made cautery above the ankle of the foot, and left it so long that the leg was all swollen, and the foot also, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a loosening of the bowels from which came death.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make a cautery in one and the other, according to this method.
And the wise men said about cautery of the hip, of which here is the method, make such an iron and let it be at the head as thick as a date pit, or a little less, and let it be with crosspieces and from one crosspiece to the other have the space of a thumb joint;
and let the crosspieces be open on two sides, and be like knots, and have a well-made iron handle;
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then put it on the socket of the diseased hip, and let it be turned onto the healthy side;
and cauterize it once with a round cautery and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; after that, treat with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use this cautery little because of fear of its appearance, and we see few who use it;
and yet this is one of the good cauteries, for those who can bear it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with crosspieces in which descends the edge of the opening, and let it be of brass or iron with a long wall, and in the height have two knots, and have between each the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and let them be open outside and above, and join together according to this form:
After put it on the hip socket of the patient lying on their healthy side, and press your hand firmly on the hip socket; after pour between the two circles hot water that has been heated on the fire a little, and leave it for an hour of time, and let the patient endure the heat and burning of it.
For he finds there a stinging as if from fire;
and when the stinging has passed, lift your hand with the instrument and wash the hip with fresh water, and leave it thus for three days, and put butter on it until what is black from the scalding is removed; and leave it three days so that pus will come out;
and this will be the last help after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make him an instrument that holds water according to what you have done for the hip equally;
and this is the method of hot water, and I have written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole outside such that the point of a razor can enter;
where there is a small hole outside such that the point of a razor can enter; and put over this pot another well-leaded pot, and put on top alkali and lime and fresh water, so much that there is a finger's width above the powders when you have well pressed it with your hand;
and leave it thus until caustic water descends and falls into the leaded pot, then take all this water, and pour it on lime and on alkali as before.
And then it will be very caustic and is administered in many medical operations and in cauteries of other members.
For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well such as copper vitriol and anacardium honey and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of hip pain and sciatic vein, and praises it much, and says that no other cure was done, and that he was healed in a single time when this cure was done, and he had bathed as he teaches here after.
And he says in such manner that you take fresh green litharge and dry it, and grind it well with a little grease, and put it on the hip and on the thigh and on the leg where the pain holds, and bind it;
and leave it three hours and for the quantity that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is a little wet, and make him go to bed, and the pain will go away entirely and he will be healed.
And know that none should use cautery of such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps much;
and the cautery must be done in such manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and put it on the small hollow that is between the thumb of the foot and the other that is called ankle bone.
After take dry goat dung, and set it on fire until it becomes charcoal, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do this again, and do not cease doing so until you think by sense that it reaches to the hip, and that the pain has ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "goat cautery."
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, either by falling or from percussion or by too great evacuation, or by signs of cold matter spread, none of these appearances warrant cautery, except for that which comes from infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is emptied of fetid pills or other similar things, that one makes on his back, there where the pain holds, three lines marked with ink, and in each line 5 cauteries or more according to the strength and quantity that the patient can suffer;
and the cautery should be made according to the cautery that is called "points";
and if you wish, make 3 or 4 cauteries with the medium nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the signs of the beginning are that they have short breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in knots the appearance that comes above the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with the circle cautery according to this form. So that the cautery takes each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery 2 or 3 lines, and let the points be close to each other.
After treat the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful not to administer cautery in hunchback that is in nerve spasm.
of the pain of the joints
When pains of joints are from moistures that are spread to each member of the body, and when pain comes to feet, which doctors call "podagra" properly, and when it is from cold cause and cures of medicines cannot cure it, it is cured by cauteries in such manner:
make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if there is need that you prick on the face of the foot, make cautery with all the cautery that is called "point." And if the pains come up to knees and to other joints, and this happens many times, make cautery on each knee 3 or 4 cauteries on each part, with all the olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there except until the thickness of the leather is burned.
And if the pains descend to knee and to back, administer the cautery that we have said in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist in 2 lines;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the palm of the hand;
and if the pains come up to elbows or up to shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good governance to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give him good governance and you purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines descend to the testicles and this is recent, it is necessary that when you want to treat it, he should not eat that day; and that he should use things that loosen the belly, so that the waste descends from his belly;
afterwards make him sit on his back between your hands, and command him to hold his breath until the intestines return, and guide them back with your fingers, and mark with ink below the rupture on the pubic bone, and make a sign that resembles half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
until it is white and throws off sparks. Then return the intestines to their place; and the assistant should keep his hand on them so they don't return backward;
and spread well the thighs of the patient, and put under him a cushion and an assistant on the thighs, and another on the chest who holds his hands;
then put the cautery on the mark with your hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you don't reach it the first time, start again another time until you come to the bone; and guard carefully that the intestines don't come out when you use the cautery; lest you burn them; and that through this the patient doesn't die, or other evils occur.
And know that when you don't reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be thin according to their measure, and for adults also large according to their measure;
after 3 days treat the cautery site with butter until the burn is removed;
afterwards treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie 40 days on his back until the wound is well sealed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be laxative for a long time, so that the intestines don't come out when he starts to go to the chambers.
And after 40 days, when he wants to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and wear it for 40 more days;
and let him have good rest, that he work little and guard against too much repletion from drinking and eating, and from shouting too loud;
and when he follows this instruction he is completely healed.
And I will tell hereafter the cure of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures come in other bellies and are visible, and you want them not to grow more, make a cautery with the round cautery according to its quantity, and let a third of the core be burned; afterwards treat it according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize with a triangular cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place with ink and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and guide your hand in the middle with the nail-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
On ancient pain in any member: When pain comes in any member, either from falling or from striking, and this pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is not effective, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points," and let the cautery be according to the length of the member and its smallness and its weakness and its strength and its location of twists and its pain.
if he is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, begin another cautery above that one, for such is the custom that it should move to the member that is nearby, which is why it is necessary that you make the cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cauterization, especially the disease that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you want to cauterize it, observe if the disease is at the beginning, and if it is treated according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend nor remain, and you fear that the corruption might overtake the whole patient, then make 5 cauterizations on the head: One in the middle of the head at nine, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two corners, and one behind on the nape;
and keep your hand there until the cauterization reaches the bone, and until the crusts come out so that the vapors of thick humors can escape;
and cauterize on the soft part according to what was mentioned before.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere; and it shows manifestly, you must cauterize with these cauterizations that we mentioned on the head, and one cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on the spine of the neck, and six cauterizations on the spine of the back, and one large one on the croup and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the cartilages of the chest, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and guard yourself against the nerves that are on the back of the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cauterization on the wrist bone, and another on the breastbone, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauterizations you make, the more help you provide, and the better it benefits;
and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cauterization as healthy people do, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And the cauterizations must be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the types of irons.
Afterward, treat the area with vetch flour with honey and other treatments until it is healed.
When swelling comes in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauterizations on the limb according to the size and smallness of the limb;
and let the cauterization penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes one makes cauterization on the hand and foot and back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and nevertheless, no one should undertake this if they do not know the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease which is called "albaras" is old, and the devices of medicine are worth nothing, then cauterize it with a cauterization a little deep, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then treat it with vetch flour and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, one part of each; and let all be mixed together, and be bound with a cloth, and be attached to the place until it is healed.
the treatment of cancer by cauterization
When cancer comes at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the cancer.
And nevertheless the wise men said that one should also make cauterization in the middle of the cancer;
and nevertheless this does not seem good to me, because I fear that it might become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen it happen sometimes;
and it is more proper that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular", as we have said in many cauterizations.
When someone has a disease that is called "adubelati", and it is slow to mature either because of the superfluity it makes or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say very old) and he has little blood, or because of the weather; and you want to hasten its maturation: then cauterize around it with many small cauterizations by pricking; afterward leave it thus. For it will hasten to ripen.
And if you want to pierce it with the cautery, then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
And put your hand in the middle of this illness which is called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the heart, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it from outside in such a way that the flow of pus is relieved.
Afterward treat it until it is completely healed.
There is another kind of illness which is called "corrodens," and it is nothing other than an itching of the limb, for it eats away at the limbs just as fire does dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can withstand cautery with fire, then heat the nail-shaped cauteries, both very small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the illness is;
afterward cauterize it from all sides until you remove all the corruption, and nothing remains of it, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places sulfur ground with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
Afterward treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, that is good;
and if not, then begin again the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places.
And this itching is sometimes cured by sharp medicine in place of cautery by fire;
but nevertheless cautery by fire is of greater help, and I have already spoken of the treatment with sharp medicine in the division: take it when you have need of it.
About warts that come to the feet Very often it happens that on the feet externally grows an illness which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large matted thing that hurts the foot.
And the cautery for this illness is according to two methods. That is to say cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is when you heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's feather, and it should be made of good iron to the measure that it can encompass the corn from all sides, and that it has thin edges;
afterward put it all hot on the corn, and turn your hand all around the corn until it reaches the bottom of the corn; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus; then make it a plaster of wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the plaster on all night, and the corn will fall and will be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the place with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are converted to the outside of the body, and many times it happens both in hands and in feet, then it is necessary that you administer cautery of hot water; and it is in such manner: take a tube of brass or iron, or a vulture's feather, and put it on the corn and the althelul, that is to say warts; and put the tube on so that it encompasses all around, then put in a little hot water, and hold your hand steady, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the tube comes to the root of the corn, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root;
and let the patient endure a little the stinging of the hot water for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will uproot itself completely with all its roots.
Do thus one after another, until you pull out all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from coldness of nerves, or from quartan fever or from another, it is necessary that you make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the chest, and one on the stomach with the olive-shaped cautery;
thus it will leave off trembling, and the healing of the cold illness will hasten.
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body swellings, or stinking pustules, which come from gross corrupted matters.
It is necessary at first when they appear to make a cautery on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, of which the point is lit by fire, or of the root of long aristolochia, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes one cauterizes them at the beginning when they appear, according to this manner, and they cannot grow from then on, but the superfluity from which they come is broken up, and they are healed;
but this must be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times there occurs great flowing of blood from the artery which is cut in the wound that comes from outside, or from the incision of the abscess, or from cautery of the limb, and similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to stanch.
And nevertheless when this happens to someone, hasten to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it hard until the blood is calmed beneath your finger, and that not a drop comes out more;
then put in the fire several olive-shaped cauteries both small and large until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on this vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stanched.
And if it jumps out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this one after another until the blood is stanched;
and take care that you do not burn the nerve which is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot well stanch it especially when the artery is large, if it is not by one of the four manners that we have said: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not pulled out, or by strong binding with thread, or by medicines placed on top which have the power to stanch blood; and it should be bound and tightened properly.
Whoever will administer stanching by tight binding with cloths or by putting burning things on top, or other similar things, it will profit little if at all.
And if this happens to someone and they have neither physician nor medicine present, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press well until it is stanched above the wound and above the vein; and do not remove the finger, but moisten it often with cold water that is very cold until the blood is congealed and thickened and stanched;
and do thereafter what is needed of cauteries and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter every illness in which cautery of fire is needed, or of burning medicine, and the occasions and the causes and the instruments and the forms of cauteries;
and I have put that chapter from the head down to the feet, and I will go in this chapter by that same way so that one finds more easily what one wants.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, dear son, that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first about cauteries, and therefore greater caution is needed.
For in the work of this chapter there often occurs evacuation of blood in opening the vein, and in incision upon abscess, and in cures of wounds, and in extraction of arrows, and in incision for stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness. For many kinds of people come for cures. Thus come some who become so angry with their illness that they die easily because of the madness they find from their illness, and from the greatness of their malady; and of these one should be afraid.
And of these there are some who give you their meaning, and say: "wait, I am cured"; and the illness is contemptible.
It is not fitting that you agree with those who come to you with this manner, but place greater concern in your honor than in your greed, and do not work foolishly but wisely with that of which you are certain, and from which you can have reward and praise;
and use prognosis and indication in cures of your patients to which health may be restored;
and this will help you to acquire good renown, and glory, and memory of praise.
Very dear son, May Our Lord give you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have arranged this chapter by dividing it into chapters, according to what is before in the chapter on cauterization, which I have described to you from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you will need.
Know that this illness comes very often to children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes too hard on the child's head;
and sometimes this comes from a hidden cause that one doesn't know.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and in all those that I saw death hastened; and because of this it seems to me better to leave off working in such cures.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger each day so much that he could not support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered beneath the bone above the syphac, between the skin and the bone;
and the operation is such if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the swelling is small, that you make in the middle of the head a wide incision;
and let it be as long as two knots, until the moisture runs out;
and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture has increased more, and the swelling is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the signs that you see are the sutures of the head open on each part, and the water jumps out when you press it with your hand on the inside, and this is not hidden from you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this manner:
And after the incision draw all the moisture out. After bind the incisions with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil there, and leave it thus until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with probes and ointments, and let the head be bound evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
And another manner of incision is that you look where the size of the swelling appears, and the gathering of water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Cut therefore there where the swelling appears, and the filling of water, and split it according to what you have the power to do;
and be careful not to cut the artery; and blood flow might come, such that the patient dies from the running of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone gets an illness which is called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is old, and the cure of medicine does not profit, then the last cure is cauterization along with cutting the two arteries.
It is necessary therefore, when you want to cut them, that the patient have his head shaved; after rub the place with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then let the patient tighten his neck with a cloth; then look where the vein beats, and the places of the one and the other are behind the ears, and are little hidden;
then mark the places with ink, then cut the one and the other with a spatula sharp on both sides, until the cut comes to the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you want, push the spatula under the artery and cut it above, cutting about two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood leaps up continuously outward.
And if the artery is not apparent to the touch, it is necessary that you measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut to the bone;
and what blood needs to be let out is 6 ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can bear, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it so that hot abscesses don't form there, then compress the wound and bind it, and treat with ointment until it is healed.
on migraine When an old migraine comes, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of tears and heat in the temples and old mad headache and similar things, and it has been treated with various medical cures and none of this helps, we extract the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient should have the hair of their temples shaved, and attend to the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is only hidden except in some men who are too cold;
and if it is hidden, the patient should constrict their neck with some cloths, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and sprinkle the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which here is the form: then carefully skin the hide until you reach the artery, then pull it up with tweezers, and separate it well from the membranes that are beneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it at that part according to the size of the two ends. For if it is not cut, the blood will not flow out completely.
And draw out from six ounces to three of blood;
and if the artery is large, it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a strong double thread of silk, so that rot doesn't come before the healing of the wound, and bleeding occurs;
then cut the excess that is between the two ties at that same hour, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with the knife-like cautery to the bone until the ends are cut;
and this is the best procedure, if the patient doesn't have fever and is of hot complexion. For the cautery helps to end the moistures: therefore it is of greater help for moistures.
Or it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fills the place with old cotton and puts well-made tents on top;
and when they are untied, treat it with dry medicines that make flesh grow, and with tents, until it is healed;
and if blood flows from the artery while you are working, hurry to cut with the cautery, or fill the place with vitriol and compress with your hand until the blood is stanched; and if you don't have this at hand, put your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the blood stops, and is compressed as needed;
And there should be between the two blades one finger's width of space, and then when you have marked with ink the two places, and you put the hot iron on until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and the two ends should be kept apart for it is not completely sealed by this cautery;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and what is better and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cutting cautery on two sides, but the cutting edges should be very thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains less heat.
Regarding tears When tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are above the skull of the head from outside, and no medical treatment that one applies helps, and you see the face of the patient redden, and he feels in his forehead movement as if of ants; and his eyes are thin and moist such that the eyelash hairs have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and scraped by the burning of tears, then this treatment is needed. And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it is that you have the patient who has this illness shave the hairs that he has on his forehead, then make three cuts on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it is that you have the patient who has this illness shave the hairs that he has on his forehead, then make three cuts on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and one of the cuts should be about two fingers wide right in the middle of the forehead going down until the nose, and the other two at the two sides above the eyelids, and be careful of cutting the arteries that are at the two sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two mandibles, and let each wound be the width of three fingers placed together;
and have ready a piece of sponge and many dry cloths to wipe the blood, then insert the sharp spatula with two sides of which here is the form:
from the incision that is toward the temple until the second incision; and peel away all the skin that is between the two cuts with all the membrane that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then pull out this spatula. then insert in the first cut the instrument that is called "cultellaire," and is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not sharp, and this is its form:
And put the cutting side toward the flesh attached to the skin, and the smooth side toward the bone, and push it until it comes to the middle cut.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous up to what appears of the skin, and then do the same in the middle cut up to the other outside one;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the place for the collected blood;
then put in each cut a tent of old cotton, and put on top cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and watch that no hot swelling comes;
and on the third day undo the binding, and apply a great quantity of lukewarm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and with other treatments with which one treats wounds, until it is healed.
When sharp catarrh comes to someone habitually, and you see the eyes thin and small, and the sight weakening, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the depth of the head there is sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that these materials and this catarrh only come from many veins, and the best treatment that exists is this one.
And it is that you command the patient to shave his forehead, then make a large cut in the middle of the forehead, and another one of the width of a thumb. And begin from the cut of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move during eating;
and when the bone is uncovered, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate between the two lips of the cut and put there old cotton, and linen tents; then bind on top cloths moistened in wine and oil, and watch for hot swelling;
when it is removed, it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with desiccating things, which make flesh generate.
In such manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and of rosin four parts, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to generate flesh throughout.
about blocked ears
All that falls in ears is one of four things: either grains, or beast, or mine stone or similar thing such as iron; or seed, such as vetch, beans, peas; or flowing thing such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other kind of thing falls into the ear that doesn't belong there, nor grows in the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, drip a little violet oil or sesame oil, then administer extraction; and make them sneeze with condisi, and plug their nostrils when the sneeze comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and stretch the ear upward.
Many times it comes out through this cure;
and if it doesn't come out, administer extraction with fine tweezers, of which here is the form:
If it jumps out with the tweezers, that's good;
if not, then administer extraction with a fine hook of small curvature;
and if it doesn't come out by this, make a brass tube and push the end of the tube into the ear hole firmly, and plug what's around the tube with soft wax so that air cannot enter with the tube; then pull strongly outward, for many times it comes out as we have said;
and if it doesn't come out in this way, take bird lime used for catching birds, and put it on the end of some instrument that's suitable for this purpose, and put a little cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull outward.
And if it doesn't come out through all these things we have mentioned, then hasten to split the ear before a hot abscess comes, and spasm;
and the manner of splitting is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to the measure of their strength, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn their ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear in the flesh at the dependent place; and let the incision be like a moon, until you come to the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and suck it out quickly with your mouth;
and treat until they are healed.
And if it's grain that's inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin, fine spatula according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But don't do this when you think the grain is moist from the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it;
then extract it with fine tweezers and by sucking, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
For water that falls in the ear, it is necessary that the patient first use sneezing with condisi, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let them lie on that same ear where the water is. If it comes out by this, that's good.
If not, then take several stones according to the length of your finger, thin and light, and heat them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the hole of their ear, and jump up on one of their feet on the other side, and strike another stone against the stone that is in the ear; and don't cease doing this from stone to stone until all the water comes out, and thus it all comes out;
and if you wish, take a reed, and push one of the ends into the ear, and light the other end on fire until most of the reed is burned;
then do the same again with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said for the stone.
For the extraction of insects, if it is of small body, such as a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is of large body that can be felt, then administer extraction with tweezers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that can be in the ear.
On the extraction of worms generated in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and the treatment is not effective, you must examine the ear in sunlight: if any worms appear there, extract them with fine pincers, and if they don't appear, take a reed of which here is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the thinner end in the ear according to how much the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with the reed; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they refuse to come out, plug around the reed with cotton as I said for the stone;
and if they don't come out as we have said, administer distillations that the ancients have proven effective in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and your medicines in the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or brass, narrow below with a small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside use a well-made brass instrument for this, and if you wish take a razor and wrap cotton suitably around its point; then pour your oil or your juice, and whatever you want of your medicines into the reed, and let the reed be in the ear;
then push in the razor with the cotton, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled to the end of the ear; and let the patient feel it inside, and let the distillation be slightly warmed by fire before it is distilled into the ear; and ensure it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as effective.
on the blockage of ears
Some children are born who have no hole in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men through blockage from a wound, or from flesh grown inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes comes deep in the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes it occurs a little outside the hole, and one can see it well.
That which comes deep, so that one cannot see it, is difficult to heal in many conditions, and in that which one sees, it is necessary that you place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the blockage apparent, open it with this spatula of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and flat behind, so that it does not harm the ear;
if the blockage is from flesh grown in the body of the ear, hold it with fine pincers, and cut it gently, until all that flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep in the ear, take a fine light razor and warm it a little by fire, then put it in the body of the ear.
If you feel the blockage from which the patient feels difficulty in hearing, pierce gently, and be careful not to harm the nerves of the ear;
then put in the ear a tent according to the width of the hole, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for some days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and powder over it ground vitriol;
and if you see the ear swollen, you must remove the tent and replace it with another tent moistened in cerote which is made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; then treat it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, plunge a sponge and cloths in cold water, and put it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop bleeding which are in the treatise on distillations.
These growths that come on eyelids of the eyes when they are moist and are dry, you must stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut them from their roots with a spatula; then put ground vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows from it, cauterize it with a subtle lenticular cautery, and cauterizing after the incision works better;
and often they return, when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, these roots are burned and do not come back.
of the hail Often there come in the eyelids things that resemble hail in their form and hardness, and for this reason this illness is called "grandine," and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelid; the procedure is such:
the procedure is such: observe if the hailstone moves from one side to the other, and this is an easy thing to know;
then make a wide incision, then carefully peel back each part, then take it with pincers, and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does no harm to the patient;
and if the incision is large, close it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not force it, for the ointment will restore it quickly and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone is descending to the inside of the ear towards the upper part, then turn the eyelid over, and stretch the hailstone with pincers, and cut it and press from one side and the other;
and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, this does no harm;
and when the hailstone is cut, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a fat that is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and greatly troubles their eyes, and catarrh comes to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes;
and for this reason they lie on their faces constantly, and sleep thus, and their eyelids below their eyebrows are moist such that the swelling and appearance have covered the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains exinach on each side, then put it on him; and press with your fingers from one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then make an incision in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula, a wide incision, and let it not be larger than the wound made when bleeding a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several cases exinach comes from the incision, in the form of a piece of white fat.
Then draw it out with a piece of lint cloth between your fingers to the outside, and turn your hand right and left until it is spread out;
and be careful not to probe the incision, lest you come with the spatula all the way to the eye and wound it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then carefully increase the incision a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and put them on the area, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and put it on to destroy the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes to the area, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
On eyelid hairs When additional unnatural hairs grow on the eyelids and become old, they harm the eyes and cause various diseases such as chronic tearing, eyelid softening, and white spots, to the point that it causes destruction of the eyes;
And the treatment is according to four methods: Either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine as mentioned before in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by clamps, as I will explain.
One must place the patient's head in one's lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand;
If it is inverted, that is good; If not, then insert a needle with a thread above; And this should be near the edge of the eyelid where the hair grows next to these hairs, and pull a thread above with the eyelid, and turn it to the razor;
Then make an incision in the lower part of the eyelid, below the additional hairs, with the cutting spatula, from the large tear duct to the small one;
Then pull out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small tent of cotton and cloth, then mark on the eyelid a figure with ink, like a myrtle leaf, and always the figure should be according to the quantity you wish to lift the eyelid which is divided for all.
And there are some who need a large quantity of the eyelid to be cut according to how softened the eyelid is;
Then cut with the spatula along the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct to the small one; And one of the incisions should be near the natural hairs at the thickness of a ray, then insert the hook in one of the two angles of the heart, then skin it all;
Then join the two lips with a suture using a needle with a fine wool thread, and dry the blood, and make the excess threads stick above the two eyebrows with some sticky substances, if you want to do this;
And if not, don't worry about it, then leave the suture and threads for three or four days;
Then treat the wound without suture with drying and constricting things, for the eyelid rises with the healing of the wound and its joining, but the suture is better (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; And there is another method:
And there is another method: Which is that you mark the eyelid with a figure that is like a myrtle leaf, as we have told, with three separate hooks according to this form:
Then cut what protrudes with small scissors evenly according to this form:
And if you cannot hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, take a needle with a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure; And insert another thread near the large tear duct, and the second thread near the small one, and gather the threads evenly between your fingers;
Then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have marked, as we have told, then join the two lips of the wound by suture, and treat it until it is healed;
And if swelling comes to your incision, soothe it with wax ointment and similar soothing ointments;
And sometimes it happens that the eyelid hairs are inverted:
So you must use what we have said about the incision;
But the suture in both cases is more artistic.
The treatment with clamps is according to this form: Which is that you invert the eyelid and cut it inside as I have said, and then make two clamps by art, and two fine bindings as long as the eyelid and the width of the spatula; And cut at the two ends of two parts where you hold the threads;
Then join one and the other subtly above what protrudes from the eyelid, and tighten the two clamps strongly from both sides; And leave it thus for some days, and the skin that was tightened will die and blacken and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, cut it with scissors, then treat it until it heals;
and when the wound is sealed, and the eyelid is raised, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the form of the two sheaths that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity in length and width:
the procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and insert a soft and fine silk thread; then join the ends and tie one and the other delicately, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the sheath another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then have the patient put their head in your lap;
and let it be near the sun so that the procedure is illuminated, for this is a delicate and minute procedure, then insert the needle with the sheath at the root of the attached hair, and make it pierce the eyelid quickly until you draw it above the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the sheath, and insert into the sheath this hair, whether there be one or two or three or more;
then pull your hand so that the hair comes out with the sheath in the eyelid along with the natural hair.
And if the sheath is pulled and the hair doesn't come out with it, then pull the sheath below with the thread that you have arranged there, until the sheath comes out of the hole above and you can see it by eye;
then you will pull the sheath and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for 2 or 3 days, until the hair adheres in its place and flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is small, accompany it with a long hair from the natural hairs, and let it be raised with that one or leave it, until it has lengthened and then lift it.
concerning the putrefaction of the eye When this disease which is called "aleacrati" or putrefaction comes to the eye, there are two types of it:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it occurs by sealing of wounds, or from cutting or cautery, and from similar things.
And the manner of the procedure for it is that you split that seal, and separate its lips, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it heals;
and you should not use in treating it things that dry and constrict. For if you do this, the disease returns worse than the first;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and sprinkle it with water where marshmallow and linseed have been cooked, and diachilon ointment melted in some oils, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with this.
And the key to your treatment is that you take care that it does not seal according to the form it was before;
and this procedure that we have described is nothing but a correction of this disease, so that it does not return in the form it was before.
This disease that is below which is truly called "axacrati", and is natural and accidental.
The accidental comes from wounds and splits and cautery and similar things;
and the way of the procedure for it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and stick it in the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes in two ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula. And if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that is good;
if not, then take a razor and put it in the split, and turn the eyelid, and make two splits on the side inside the eyelid;
and let the ends of the two splits be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and let an angle be made so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter which is called "Greek I";
then remove that flesh, according to the quantity that its side is sharp below, from what follows the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread;
then treat it with what we have mentioned of softening medicines, and tents, until it heals.
And if the disease comes from a cut or a suture or cauterization, it is necessary that you make a clean incision below the hairs of the eyelids, according to what was mentioned before; then separate between the two edges with a probe, as I have said;
then separate between the two edges with a probe, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the disease, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares his skill with all his power to make the figure return to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what is needed in terms of work and instruments in various situations.
When this welding happens to many men in such a way that the upper eyelid is fused with the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, it is therefore necessary that you insert the point of a razor under the eyelid, and lift it up;
and stretch it with pincers, until you cut what is attached with a subtle spatula, which should not be too sharp or too cutting, so that the patient can bear it without the too-sharp spatula wounding the eye;
and your incision, with which you separate this junction, should be light, so that the eyelid returns to its natural form;
and all this junction is healed, and sometimes they put salt water in the eye, and wash it with fresh water, and with eye drops;
then put between the eyelid and the eye a linen probe, and put on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after the third day use eye drops and healing substances until it is healed.
Know that the pterygium is of two types: it is either sinewy and similar to a hard membrane, or another which is not sinewy, but is similar to congealed white moisture, which when one touches it with iron and tries to grasp it with pincers, one cannot;
and both types begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover all vision and all light and the movement of the eye.
And the manner of incision is that the patient should put his head in your lap, then open his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then gather the pterygium with small-folded pincers, and stretch it upward; then take a needle, and put in it a horse hair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and bend the needle point a little and stick it in the middle of the pterygium, and pierce it with the needle, and tie the pterygium with a thread and stretch it upward, and separate with the hair the side of the pterygium that follows the pupil and follow it with the hair to the end, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with the subtle spatula and with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh in the tear duct, so that through the incision the flow of tears does not become habitual;
and sometimes the pterygium is stretched with the hook alone, and with the thread, as we have said; then one separates it gently with the spatula of which this is the form:
And be careful that the spatula does not touch and break the fleshy membrane, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision throw in the eye a little ground salt, and eye drops made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is needed until it is healed.
And if the pterygium is not sinewy, and you cannot insert the needle, and the hook cannot enter, many times this type of pterygium is cured with medicines;
and they grow as I have told in the division, and if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take the light spatula slightly sharpened according to this form: And scrape the pterygium above subtly, and if you see that it diminishes at all and the scraping affects it, then drop from your mouth into the eye drops made of litharge and red eye drops and ground salt, and cover the eye until the next day;
If nothing is contrary in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then restart the procedure as before, until it is healed.
then restart the other work according to this same procedure, until it is all removed.
And if the appearance of flesh in the tear duct troubles the eye greatly, suspend it with the hook, and cut a part of it but not all, so that the flow of tears may still come;
then distill red collyrium in the eye which is made of litharge.
In some men's eyes sometimes grows red flesh, and it covers the pupil and constrains the eyelids and turns them outward, and looks like a pomegranate flower;
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly;
then cut the first flesh, and keep cutting with the razor until the end, and be careful not to wound the eye during the procedure;
and let the incision be made with the spatula that we mentioned in the incision of the pterygium and with small forceps with which one removes the pannus, as the form after this chapter shows;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or distill red collyrium and similar corrosive medicines, and put cotton with egg white on the outside of the eye, so that it is protected from hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and hot blood overwhelms you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that calm hot abscesses;
then return to your procedure until it is healed, and do likewise when flesh is added to the eye in this manner.
However, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each weak eye by the natural way; and by the accidental way, in working with iron;
and do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that this member can bear that procedure.
Pannus are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they hinder the sight's function and weaken the eye continually.
It is necessary then first that you observe if the eye, in which pannus is, is strong, and has no other illness except the pannus; then gather it in this manner:
command the patient to put his head in your lap, then suspend these veins with the hook according to your knowledge, and let the hook be subtle double according to this form:
And let there be two hooks by degrees in one body according to this form:
then gather those veins subtly with forceps, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins move away from the eye;
and be careful not to wound the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this procedure at noon before the sun, and be very fervent in your procedure so that you cut nothing but those veins;
and when you have done this, then distill green and red collyrium in the eye to destroy what remains of the pannus.
And if you cannot gather all this in that hour, then make a plaster on the eye of things that ease the pain of eyes, and leave it some days until the pain is eased and it is protected from hot abscess, then restart according to this manner which is before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the forceps:
The physicians call fistula "arissati":
when you treat it by cautery and by sharp burning medicine according to what I said before, and it is not healed, then the technique is that you split above the abscess, there where it should ripen, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you will see the corruption and the blackness, then scrape it with the instrument of which here is the form;
and it is called "rough head", and should be made of Indian iron with a round head, and should be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the location of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that this corruption is scraped away;
and do this several times, then treat the area with drying medicines.
if the area is sealed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the wound is sealed, and remains so for 40 days, and it doesn't reopen and isn't swollen, and no bad symptoms appear, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other method than to bring the fistula to the hole of the nerve according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time by iron, and by sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered take a drill according to this form, and let the head be of iron with three angles, and let the shaft be tapered to the end as you see here:
then place it on the bone next to the tear duct, and move your hand a little away from the eye, then turn with the drill until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it by the wind that comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then treat the area with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter goes to the nerve; so it is an easier thing for the patient.
When the eye appears completely outside, and there comes no disturbance to the nerve, nor diminishment, it is necessary that you bind the patient;
then bleed him, then apply cups to the nape without cutting to suction, then put on the eye a bandage made of acacia and aloe and incense and sarcocolla, and then compress the eye, and plaster it over with bands and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take cloths quite soft, and fold each in four, and then put one on top of the other according to the quantity that the eye needs;
then compress it firmly from above with a hard bandage, and restart the cups for suction without cutting;
then remove the cups and leave the eye compressed day and night, and if the binding loosens, it is necessary that you compress it much;
then remove the binding after the day and night, and if you see the eye returning, that is good;
if not; then restart the plaster and the cloths and the binding and the cups until it is healed.
On the rupture of the uveal membrane When rupture comes in the uveal membrane, then appears, and comes out of the eyelids like a grape seed, and is frightful to see;
then if you want to cut it, the procedure is such that you push a needle into the root from the lower part to the upper part, then push another needle which has a double thread from the part of the tear duct; and make it pierce through, and leave the first needle according to the disposition;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie one part of the uvea around, and tighten it well, then remove the needle and put on the eye wool soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread falls with the uvea, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uvea on each side with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye gives great appearance, pierce it with a subtle spatula that comes deep into the eye, and let the albuminous moisture run and let the eye descend, and enter in at once;
then withdraw it until it is healed.
This disease which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but pus that has gathered in the eye, appearing like descending water, and it is not water;
and the manner of performing the operation is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and upright seat, then take the head between your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the pus come to the surface before your eyes; then it should be fixed there, and should not descend and the light should be cleared, and the patient should see things as he used to;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the pus is not arranged as we have said.
make the patient sit between your hands, then take the thin spatula and make an incision on the corneal membrane a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane and the corona, until the pus comes out;
and when it has come out, drip into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
of the waters of the eye We have already [discussed] the appearances of the waters in the division, and what is needed for piercing; so operate according to health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands crossed, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and tighten very firmly;
then put the eyelid of the eye with your left hand if the eye is left, or with your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda," or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then put the point of the instrument beside the corona by the thickness of a ray in that whiteness of the eye at the part of the lesser tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" forcefully, and turn your hand until it pierces into the whiteness of the eye, and feel that almagda comes to the empty thing;
and the measure of the path of almagda should be to the depth of the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and this is the corona of the eye;
you will see the bone in that eyelid through the clarity of the corneal membrane, and can put the instrument up to where the water is, then press it down one way after another.
if the water descends immediately, the patient sees before him and the instrument in his eye.
After resting a little, and if the water rises up the second time, put it out with the instrument, and when it is fixed in place and does not rise, withdraw almagda gently while turning your hand little by little;
and then put back in the water a little rock salt, and wash the eye inside with this. Then put outside the eye tow or wool moistened in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye.
We, and those who are of our time, put on ground cumin with egg white.
And if almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, for there are such men who have too hard eyes, it is necessary that you take the instrument which is called "alberit," of which here is the form:
And thus pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then insert the probe, as we have said;
And upon completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable bed, where he shall sleep on his back in a dark place;
And he should be forbidden from all movements, and take light foods, and not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and be bound according to his condition until the third day;
Then unbind him in that same dark chamber, and test his vision, and make him look at some things, and then replace the bandage until the seventh day;
And you should not do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but you should delay this, because the water rises hastily.
If hot swelling comes, you should unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which soothes swelling;
And when it is calmed, unbind the sight and put a small pillow on his face to cover it for some days, and let him remain in that dark chamber.
And then let him leave the chamber little by little, and return to his activities;
And know that no apprentice should meddle in this case. And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made a perforated probe, with which they suck out the water, but nevertheless I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in the books of the ancients; And perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the appearances of the forms of the probe, so that those who do not know them may see them;
And they should be properly made of brass: And their heads should be of this same subtlety, and the back end in three sharp angles.
Sometimes diverse pieces of flesh grow on the nose, of which there are some that resemble scorpions with many feet;
And there are some where there is cancerous flesh of dark color, and there is soft flesh of good color. In those cases of flesh which is soft, and not cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
In those cases of flesh which is soft, and not cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; And open his nostrils, and insert the hook into those flesh pieces, and pull them out; Then cut what you can hold with the subtle spatula sharp on one side, until you know that all that flesh is removed.
And if there remains something that cannot be cut, open it with one of the subtle instruments gently, so that nothing remains; And if blood overcomes you, or hot swelling, tend to it as needed;
And if it is malignant swelling, then hasten and cauterize until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then put vinegar and water or wine in the nose. If the nose opens, and moisture comes through to the palate, know that it is healed;
And if moisture does not pass through as it should, know that there is flesh grown on the bone above, which the instrument cannot reach to cut:
Then you must insert a somewhat thick linen thread, and it should be tied with several knots, and have between each knot the space of a finger or less; And have the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as far as he can, and pull while breathing in until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
And many times children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it;
Then hold the end that comes through the nose with one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth with the other hand, and pull one after the other while sawing with the knots that are on the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, dry the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back again in the nose as before;
Do this for 3 days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of flesh;
And then put a lead tube in the nose for several days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them;
And this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And let it be of silver or brass, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit also;
And if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full for purging the head;
And have a handle at the end to hold it when heating the oil or any liquid.
Of the flesh on the nose
Many times there grows at the tip of the nose a disease which is called "telul," and it grows and becomes ever larger, until it is unpleasant to look at;
And for this reason you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it all out, then put on the spot the cautery or burning medicine;
And if one delays cutting it until it becomes large, then observe if it is hard, of dark color, of poor sensation:
Do not touch it with iron for it is a cancerous abscess, for when one cuts it sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
And if the abscess is soft to touch, not of dark color, and you see that one can cut it all out, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the spot with drying and astringent things.
Know that when solution of continuity comes in one of these cartilaginous works, it profits little, except in some men.
It is necessary therefore when this happens to someone, to look if the wound is fresh with all its blood; And then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
And if the lips are already separated on one part and the other, it is necessary that you scrape all the parts of their covering until they bleed, then join the two lips with a suture, and tighten it, and powder over it powder of dragon's blood, and ground incense; And put on the powders a piece of strong plaster or other healing plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The manner of the suture is that you join the solution: Either with needles, as we have said in the suture of the belly; Or with thread, as I have made known to you.
Of the abscesses of the lips
To many men there occurs inside the lips a hard abscess, resembling grains of vetches, both smaller and larger;
Then it is necessary that you turn the lips, and cut above each knot, and take it with tweezers and cut it in each part;
Then fill the place after the incision with ground vitriol, until the blood is stanched;
And then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with dry things until it is healed.
Many times there grows on the gums additional flesh, which the ancients call "albulus";
So it is necessary that you hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow;
Then put on the spot ground vitriol, or other astringent and desiccative powders;
And if that flesh returns after the incision, and many times it happens, cut it a second time, and cauterize it: Then it does not return after the cautery;
Sometimes crusts gather at the tops of teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, which are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and green, until the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth stink;
thus you should have the patient sit between your hands, with their head in your lap, and scrape the teeth where the crusts appear, until nothing remains; and do the same for the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and other stains, until they are cleaned;
and if what is there is removed with the first scraping, that is good; if not, then begin scraping again the second day and the third, until you have scraped everything;
and know that teeth need different forms of instruments for scraping, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers used outside the teeth have different forms than those used between the teeth; and these forms and others should be ready with you.
It is advisable when you treat the tooth for its pain that you delay extraction as long as you can, for this should not be done; for this is a very noble substance until there is no excuse for scraping.
Then when the patient is constrained to extraction, you must be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they think it is in a healthy tooth, and have the good tooth pulled; and still the pain does not depart through this, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this happen to these lords;
and when you are quite certain of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps at first little by little, until it is well loosened, then grip it firmly with the forceps; and let the patient's head be in your lap between your knees, and hold them well so they don't move.
Afterward extract the tooth straight without breaking, and if it doesn't come out, take one of these instruments and push it in gently from each side, and move it as you did first.
And if the tooth is pierced and eaten away, you must fill it with small cloths, there where the holes are; and grip it carefully with the forceps, so it doesn't break during extraction;
and one must work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And take good care that you don't break it, leaving a part remaining, and causing the patient greater pain than the first through the malice of the root.
And take care that you don't do as ignorant surgeons do, who through their haste and their boldness sometimes break the jawbone, and don't administer what we have described;
but sometimes cause through this occasion great illness because of the roots that remain, or because of the jawbone they break, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs there, which often happens, fill the area with ground vitriol;
and if this doesn't work, then cauterize it.
The forms of instruments, with which one first moves the teeth, should have long points and thick handles, so they don't bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the forms: And they should have thick members so they don't bend during extraction, and should be made of good Indian iron, and should be toothed for better grip.
about tooth roots When the root remains after extraction, you must put cotton soaked in butter on the area for 1 or 2 days, until the area is softened, then insert the forceps that are called "algefri," whose head resembles a swan's beak;
and they should be made inside like a file and this is the form:
And if the roots won't come out with these forceps, you must uncover the flesh all around the root, and insert the instrument that is called "althali," that is to say a lever, of which here is the form:
And it should be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out by this, that is good;
if not, then help yourself with all the instruments, whose forms come hereafter:
And one can help oneself with this instrument which has two prongs, whose form is here: and with other iron tools which are mentioned before in the section on teeth, and with this instrument which resembles large tongs, whose form is here:
And this instrument should be strong so it cannot break, and know that there are many dental instruments; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise subtle master finds his own instrument by himself, according to what his work and the disease shows him, for there are such diseases where the ancients did not teach any instrument due to their diversity; and if any part of the jawbone or other bones breaks, or it rots, then search for the instruments that are needed, which I have told you about, and help yourself with the tools, whose form is here:
And they should be thick and grip well to hold the bone, so it doesn't escape, but can be held and removed;
and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to the natural course, and the form is ugly, and especially in young women, it is necessary that you know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and one cannot saw or file it:
then scrape it; and if it is attached to the tooth, then take this instrument whose form is here, and it resembles a small beak, and should be made of sharp Indian iron at the tip:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you don't move the others, and if it appears that one can file it, then file it with such a file whose form is here:
and it is like the file with which one makes needles;
and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it doesn't move until it falls;
then smooth it at the end with some scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, it is necessary to file the roughness until it is even, so that it doesn't hurt the tongue or corrupt speech.
When the front teeth are loose, either by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot press on what they eat without them falling, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this doesn't work;
then they must be bound with a gold wire, for silver wire becomes green and rots, but gold never changes;
and the wire should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth;
and if you want to straighten the teeth, then take the wire and push it double between the two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, if there are one or more, until you come wisely to the healthy tooth on the other side; then begin the covering again until the part where you began, and tighten your hand subtly and wisely, until it doesn't move at all;
and your binding should be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the wire with tongs, and join them, and hide them between the healthy teeth, and put it so that it doesn't hurt the tongue;
and then leave it tight as long as it can remain, and if it comes undone, or the wire breaks, then tighten it with another wire;
it will stay and serve thus all its time, and this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of the two healthy teeth, and of the two loose ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one puts it back in its place, fresh to fresh, as we have said;
and let no one undertake this who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes the form of a tooth from cow bone, and puts it in the place where there is a gap, and tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this tie that comes under the tongue is natural, that one is born with it; or by accident from a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and have their head in your lap, and lift their tongue;
then cut the nervous tie widthwise, until the tongue is freed from its restraint, and if there is hardness or knot, and it's from a healed wound, then insert the hook and cut that tie widthwise;
and be careful that the cut is not too deep, because of the artery that is below;
and when you have done this, wash the area with rose water and vinegar, or with cold water, then put a linen tent under the tongue;
and the patient should hold it each night, so that the area cannot heal shut.
And if bleeding occurs, put ground vitriol on the area; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it with a lentil-shaped cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed,
and if you see it is of a dark color or black or hard, so that the patient cannot feel it, do not touch it at all, for it is cancer;
and if it tends toward whiteness, and there is moisture, insert the hook, and cut it with a fine spatula, and free it from one side to the other; and if the blood overcomes you in your work, put ground vitriol on it until it is stanched, then return to your work until you draw everything out;
then wash the area with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
About abscesses of the throat Sometimes swellings come inside the throat which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then take note:
if it is a hard abscess with little sensation and of dark color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is thick, do not touch it with iron, also because of bleeding; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will separate it, or it will break by itself;
and if it is of white color, round, and the root is thin, then have the instrument ready for cutting, but first look to see if the hot abscess has settled and is calmed.
Then have the patient sit facing the sun, and their head should be in your lap, and open their mouth and let the assistant take it between his hands, and press the tongue down with the instrument, of which here is the form;
and it should be of silver or of fine brass like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it out upward as much as you can;
and draw some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which here is the form, that resembles scissors; and always the heads are curved, and one opposite the other, and are very sharp, and it is made of Indian iron or steel:
And if you don't have this instrument present, then cut it with pincers, of which here is the form: And it should be sharp on one side, and not on the other;
and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision let the patient gargle with hot water, and water and vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, let the patient gargle water in which pomegranate peels have been cooked, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the blood is stanched; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses than the two tonsils grow in the throat, so cut them then just like the two tonsils equally.
And I treated a woman for an abscess that had grown inside her throat, that is to say an abscess of little sensation;
and it had already nearly closed the entire throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained so for a day or two.
And the abscess had already grown so much that it had pushed out two branches through the two nostrils.
I hastened therefore at once, and inserted a hook into one, then pulled it out, and drew out a large portion of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
after I inserted the hook into these abscesses, and cut away a part, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was unblocked, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease cutting away at this abscess for a long time;
and the abscess kept growing back, and filled the space that I had emptied, until it became very large again;
then I devised a way and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from these parts, and knew not what God did with her after me.
of the uvula
When rheum descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is thick and round at the bottom, it is called "uvula."
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not benefit, and you see that the hot abscess is calmed, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and that which is round gathered and not long; and if it is bloody or of dark color or black, you must avoid cutting it. For there is great peril for the patient.
It is necessary therefore, when you see it, according to the manner I have described, of its whiteness and its length, that you have the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention before; then insert the hook in the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils.
And you must not cut away more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you harm the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the cutting of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of cutting, then you must use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear.
And the manner of cautery is with a sharp needle. And it is that the patient puts his head in your lap, and then press the tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and mix with quicklime water, so that it is neither too thick nor too clear; and fill the hollow of this instrument, of which here is the form:
And let there be at the head a hollow where one puts the medicine, like the hollow of a spoon, and put the instrument with the medicine on the uvula;
and let the patient lie on their side, so that the saliva and mucilage runs from their mouth from the medicine within, so that it does not descend to the throat and harm it;
then hold your hand with the medicine and press it on the uvula, for the duration of half an hour, until you see it blacken and the burning of the medicine has calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it on some instrument, and wet the cotton in the medicine, and push the instrument with the cotton into the channel above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula;
and do this often, until the cautery is perfect, then leave it to dry, and it falls after 4 or 5 days.
And if you need to restart the cautery with the medicine, then restart it, and after the cautery wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and clean what is around from the medicine;
and let it be sprinkled with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This cure is safer than incision or cauterization;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calament and hyssop and oregano and rue and chamomile and southernwood and similar herbs, and combine all of them or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and bring to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hollow instrument made in this manner: And it should be of silver or brass, and one of the ends should be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is deadened;
afterward repeat often, until the uvula dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the arrival of a hot abscess, for many complications can occur; and do not do this except during the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not available, then take a tube and put inside its end an eggshell, so that the patient's mouth does not get too hot; for the eggshell does not let the vapor harm the mouth, and this is a good cure together with safety.
Many times a bone or fish bone, or some other thing, gets stuck in the throat;
so then you must extract what you can see, and press down the tongue in sunlight with the instrument, so that you can better see the thing;
and what is not visible and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the stuck thing will come out through vomiting;
or the patient should swallow a piece of sponge, or a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then have them swallow it; and when it reaches the spot, it will stick, and then you will pull it out;
and if it doesn't come out from what we have said, then take a lead instrument of this form:
And the instrument should be curved at the end so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the end raised up; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, lest coughing occur, and do not push the bone inward;
and it is better that the patient insert the instrument themselves, because they better know where the thing is stuck; push it down, or pull it out with the instrument evenly, until it is out.
about the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when this does not help, then look in the patient's throat in sunlight, after you press down the tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
And if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps that are suitable for this.
And if this doesn't work, then take a hollow tube, and insert it in the patient's throat, then put a hot iron in the hollow of the tube, and do this often. And let the patient drink water all day.
then take a glass full of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with their hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it will fall.
And if it doesn't fall as we have said, then fumigate the patient with asafoetida, using the instrument that I mentioned for the fumigation of the uvula;
do this many times, for it will fall without delay.
And the manner of fumigation is that you take a pot containing live coals, and the pot should be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole should be the end of the instrument;
then add your fumigation material, and the patient should put the end of the tube in their mouth, and close the mouth, so that the smoke doesn't escape, but reaches the leech;
and the leech will fall immediately, and if it doesn't fall, then repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty things and garlic, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary that it comes out through this treatment.
And the form of the instrument with which one draws the leech is, when one can see it, similar to curved pincers to better enter the throat; and it has resemblance to a swan's beak, and has the roughness of a file, so that what it grabs, it cannot release;
There are many types of abscesses, according to what is recalled hereafter of one and another in this book, and they are different in perforation and in cutting;
and this is in 2 manners of which one is in its appearance itself, and from what moisture it contains.
And the second manner is according to the places where they are on the body.
for the abscess of the head is different from that of the fundament, and the abscess of the fleshy place is different from that which comes in joints, and each has its judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that one must not pierce until the pus is mature according to its completion;
and there are some that must be pierced when they are grown, and do not mature according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near joints.
For when an abscess comes near joints, and one leaves it until it is rotted around, by chance the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is cause for contraction in that limb.
Or the abscess is near the principal member, and if you delay the perforation until it is mature, it will harm the principal member;
or it is near the fundament, so one pierces it before it is mature;
and one must not pierce a grown abscess without complete digestion, except for that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply, and be extended within, and fistula comes there; and cannot heal in great time.
And you must know the hour of perforation of the abscess which is mature according to completion, and this is when the pain is appeased, and the departure of fever, and the diminishing of pain and redness, and of the throbbing and of the sharpness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and you must make the perforation sit at the most dependent place of the abscess, and where it appears better;
and let the perforation be lengthwise of the body, and if the abscess is on hands or feet, or in joints and on nerves and on arteries, and in all equal places where there is no bending. In those that bend, according to that member.
And when abscess is in fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before this, the body of its venom will be extended, and is full of much filth; and by chance the lips and its depth harden.
And there are some abscesses that are pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the member needs.
And you must administer in small abscesses, small holes; and in large abscesses, large holes, and many splits according to the appearance of the size of the abscess;
and there are such abscesses where one must excavate the core, and cut; when it has already become like a cloth, and is deadened, one must do as one does with bumps:
and there are some that are split in 3 angles, and there are some from which one cuts like the myrtle leaf, such as abscesses of the corners;
and there are some where one makes a round cut, and other cuts and similar incisions.
Those who have no head [referring to abscesses], such as soft superficial swellings, it is necessary that you pierce them plainly;
and when the abscess is large, and has collected much pus, and you pierce it, do not draw out all the pus at that time, but draw out a part; then plug the abscess until the next day, then draw out some more again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small child, or decrepit old man. For the spirit sometimes escapes with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore avoid this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, dry the wound, and observe if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a plain cut, then apply tents of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many holes, it is necessary that you put in each one a tent so that they come one against the other;
and if you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have hollowed around it, it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton or with scrapings of linen cloth without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, and moisten a cloth, and place it on the bleeding spot many times.
And if the bleeding persists, then administer treatment and care, and the powders that I have mentioned in many places in this book, and if it is in winter time, and the place where the abscess is is very sinewy, it is necessary that you put on tents and cloths moistened in wine and hot oil;
and if it is in summer, and the place is fleshy, it is necessary that you put on cloths moistened in water and oil, or in wine and cold oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then unbind the abscess and dry it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in treatments of abscesses:
now I have told you how one should proceed with treatments of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
In the core of the head come small abscesses, and they are types of nodes that are in membranes, like the crop of a hen, and there are many kinds of them.
There are fatty ones and such where there is moisture like pulp;
and there are such that are hard and stony to cut, and there is no doubt unless the artery poses a problem.
And the work of cutting is that you test with an instrument which is called an "introducer," whose form comes hereafter, what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then split it lengthwise from above.
And when the moisture is emptied, then scrape without leaving anything of the skin that contains this moisture, for it always comes back when one leaves something;
then plunge cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available; if not, in water and salt, and fill the wound, and leave it until the next day; and this will corrupt what remains of the cyst.
And then restart with the cotton, as before, the second day, and the third, until you know well that none of the cyst remains;
then treat the wound with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains a fatty node, then cut it according to this form, lengthwise; and insert your hooks, and scrape it from all sides, and put all your effort into drawing out the sac in which it lies;
and if the artery poses a problem, then do what I have told you after.
And do likewise with the abscess if it is stony, both in cutting and in treating as I have told you.
And the cut on the stony and moist abscess is easier, for they have little blood. And if there are any of these swellings on the head where there is no moisture, and of these was a swelling that I cut from the head of an old woman;
and I found the swelling like a hard stone, rough and white, and it could not be broken; and if one had struck someone with it, it would have made a wound just like a stone.
In other swellings coming to the head, except those that come to children's heads and to the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, to better drain the pus;
and treat them as required.
Many times these swellings occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they come elsewhere on the body, and are numerous, and are generated one with another.
And each scrofula is properly within its sac, like the nodes and the swelling of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that will not yield to health.
in those therefore that you see of good disposition to the touch, and similar to the color of the body, and movable from each side and not attached to the nerves of the neck nor to the artery nor to the passage, and not deep;
it is necessary that you cut it from above, and skin it from each part, and spread the two lips of the heart with hooks, if you need them, as we have said in swellings of the head;
and pull it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let not the spatula be sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far forward, that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this prevents you from working, put ground vitriol in the wound, or some powders that stop blood, and tighten the wound; and leave it until the swelling has calmed down, and the wound has softened, and begins to rot.
And when the blood has stopped, return to your work, until you complete it;
then search with your index finger if any small scrofulas remain, cut them and clean them.
And if there is a large vein in the root of the scrofula, you should not cut this scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scrofula, it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, since no excess has remained due to the size of the scrofula. it is necessary that you attend to cutting its root, and pulling it out, and sew it as we have said.
it is necessary that you attend to cutting its root, and pulling it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrofulas that contain excess fluid, pierce there where it appears ripe;
and pierce it thus like the aforementioned one, downward, then administer tents with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleaned, treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
The ancients spoke and talked of the cutting of the throat; but I never saw in our land anyone who did it, and this is the writing of their word.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the split of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that one not give aid through this, because all the veins and the lung of the sick are to those who have hot swelling in the mouth, or in the throat or in both tonsils.
When the disease is in the windpipe, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the loss that comes from strangulation.
It is necessary therefore, when we want to split the epiglottis, that we split it below three or four rings a small split crosswise, between the two rings or by the quantity of the split of the peritoneum, not in the cartilage;
and this place is suitable for the section of the epiglottis as there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far from there.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with the hook, then cut the flesh until he reaches the windpipe; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see any, and then cut the membrane, as we have said;
and it is shown by the section of phlegm from the windpipe which leaps out through the place that is broken, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the hour has passed during which one fears strangulation, join the two lips of the wound of the flesh, and sew it alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that make flesh grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely blocked, and the patient is judged to be dying, and his breath fails him. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this reason the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in 3 or 4 days. And then they commanded to sew the wound and treat it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife, and stuck it in her throat, and cut part of the airways of the lung;
and I was called to treat her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had come out, and knew well that she had not cut any vein or passage except the throat, and the wind came out through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the young lady except that she became hoarse of voice, and afterward returned to her normal condition;
therefore I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no fear.
This abscess is called "hernia of the throat," and is a large abscess the color of a bean, and is common in women;
and it is of two types: natural, and accidental;
for the natural there is no remedy.
And the accidental is of two types, of which one resembles fatty nodules, and the other type resembles an abscess that comes from arterial nodes; and there is danger, and one should not operate with iron except on that which is small, and test and examine it with the probe: if you find it like a fatty nodule, and it's not attached to any vein, then cut it, as one cuts nodules, and pull it out with its covering, if there is any; and examine everything well, and treat it as necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
There are many types of nodes, of which I will describe all the appearances;
and now it is necessary that I tell all the difference between a node and an abscess.
I say that an abscess is heat and persistent fever, until the boiling is passed, and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With the node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a membrane, which is its proper sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a bean, and becomes large;
and they are of two appearances, either fatty or moist, and many colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to treat the node, that you test and examine it first with the instrument that is called "probe," according to the form that will come in the chapter that follows.
And the manner of examination of node abscesses is that you take at the moistest place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the flesh, then let it be according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the probe, and take note of what comes out.
If running moisture flows, whatever color it has, cut it as I have said for other abscesses;
and if after the probe no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, then cut it in a cross shape, and take it with pincers, and carefully skin it from each part and protect the membrane where it lies so that you draw it out healthy with the nodule;
and if you cannot draw it out healthy, then draw it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the nodule returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood troubles you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and tighten the wound, and put on things that calm hot abscesses, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the nodule is large, then sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which generates flesh.
and if the beating vein opposes you or another then hurry and fill the place with ground vitriol, and leave it bound for 2 or 3 days, until the wound rots, and the blood's boiling subsides; then return to cutting what has remained of the nodule.
Here are the forms of probe instruments, and they are of 3 types: large and medium and small;
and there are 3 square ones which are called "albaret," and 1 which is called "breb," and there are 3 types of these: large, medium, and small, for probing fistula abscesses;
and they are like the needles used to sew falcon hoods, and are made of yellow brass, or iron, or silver, and those that are yellow are worth more, and those of black lead are more proven for probing the curves of fistulas;
and they are of 3 types: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the holes.
The forms of hooks are of many appearances, as you see here:
and there are hooks that have 2 curves of 3 types also;
and there are hooks that have 3 curves, and are also of 3 types;
and there are hooks that have 2 curves, and hooks with only one curve, and they are of 3 types;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of these with which one cuts are sharp, and some of them only cut on one side, with which one skins the nodules, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these probes the blades are hidden in handles, so that the patients do not perceive them at the opening of abscesses;
and they are of 3 types: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and they are only used in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in corners, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to pistachio shells, according to this form, with which one stanches blood: and one sometimes puts it at the place that bleeds from cutting of veins, and arteries, and sometimes round according to this large form:
Sometimes men's breasts swell when they begin to be corrupted, so much that they resemble women's breasts;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and if one wants to cure them, it is necessary to cut according to this form from this line .b. to .g.: then skin away the fat, and fill the wound with medicine generating flesh, then join the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops down, and is softened by its size as happens with women, then cut it on two sides above, with two similar cuts; of which one should be connected to the other at the end of one and the other, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line .b. to line .g.; then skin the hide that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of blood flow, then it is necessary that you fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it eats away the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are types of hard scrofulas where there are layers, and there are some that contain moisture.
Those therefore that contain moisture should be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with an ointment suitable for this until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofulas, cut it as we have said in the cutting of scrofulas, and if the wound produces pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is broken, and the skin above it is sealed, abscesses often come, and the same happens with the swollen and abscessed vein;
and one recognizes it thus when it's from the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a constriction;
and when it's from the vein, it is round and visible from outside;
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the corners and on the neck and in many other places, and is very large. It is therefore necessary to avoid treatment with iron, and that which is at the head should also be avoided, and in that which is from arterial swelling, cut lengthwise above the skin;
then open the cut with hooks, and gently separate the artery from the membranes, until it is exposed;
then push a needle under it, and make it pierce through to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then pierce the place between the two ties with a probe until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is loosened;
then administer the treatment that generates pus, until the ties fall off; then treat this with suitable ointment until it is healed;
and if the abscess is from the cutting of the vein, you must hold in your hand what you can of the abscess with all the skin, then push the needle under the place that you hold in your hand, and make it pierce through, and have a double thread, so that you pull it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I told you, with the tie of one of two parts at the two ends of the thread;
and if you fear that the threads might come out, push another needle with a thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess of the skin and leave what is tied;
then put on it a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatments of dressings and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come in the artery and in the vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are struck, or through too much work, and similar things.
And this happens more often to the upper arms and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in several conditions without pain;
and when one presses it firmly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and it moves well from all sides, and goes neither forward nor backward, nor below nor above, and that which is in joints should not be cut by iron: by chance contraction would come; and that which is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with the spatula.
and that which is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with the spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with pincers, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with the hook, and skin it, then remove it and join the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes thelul occurs in bellies and nowhere else, and it is a disease that is called "fungus" due to its resemblance to them, and the root is thin, and the head large;
and there are small ones and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two of them on his belly that resembled fungi more than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had thin roots, and were already split, and moisture was constantly running from them.
I cut them and found in one eighteen ounces weight, and in the other 6 ounces, and the procedure for the incision is that you observe if the patient is moist, and the color of the thelul is white and moist and has a thin root; then cut it with a wide spatula, and have the cautery irons in the fire in your presence.
then cut it with a wide spatula, and have the cautery irons in the fire in your presence. For when cutting there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the iron incision, then take a well-made lead thread, and tie the thelul as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then tighten it, and do not cease tightening the lead thread until it cuts the thelul, and it falls off by itself without effort;
and if the roots are thick, there is fear in cutting especially because of the belly, but you can well cut half of it, then cauterize it so it doesn't return;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the thelul which is of dark color and poor sense and ugly appearance.
For it is a cancerous abscess, and I will come to the treatment of cancer hereafter.
when the bowel comes out If the appearance of the bowel comes through cautery of wound or splitting of the syfac, and is on the belly and some of the bowels come out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood that runs from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from windiness;
and if it is through the rupture of the syfac and through the exit of the bowel, then the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body, and is an easy thing without pain, and appears from various exits. And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then it is more varied, and when one presses it with fingers it hides away, and then returns, and by chance it is compressed, and grows much upon entering the bath and through hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is an easy thing, and appears well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrict;
and if it is due to blood, the abscess appears by these signs large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to windiness, it is soft to touch, and the procedure is that you observe if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or from the vein, or windiness.
and if it is due to windiness, it is soft to touch, and the procedure is that you observe if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or from the vein, or windiness. So it is appropriate that you abandon the treatment. For there is doubt and fear about it, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, because of the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or bowel, you should command the patient to hold their breath, and be stretched out straight, then mark with ink all around the swelling; then command them to lie supine between your hands, then go around the marked place with the spatula, then stretch half of the abscess upward with the large hook; then tie around it with a strong thread, or with a strong silk cord firmly, and let the knot of the binding be loose;
then open half of the abscess stretched above the binding, and insert your index finger, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the binding, untie it, and push the intestine to the outside of the belly;
and if you find the bowel, take it with the hook, and cut away the excess;
and if the artery gives you trouble, or the vein, go gently around it, then return to your work and take 2 needles, and insert 2 strong threads, and push the 2 needles around what you have done in a cross where you made the piercing;
then tighten the abscess in 4 places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it has become thin and rotted, then treat it with what is necessary, and remove the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it has become thin and rotted, then treat it with what is necessary, and remove the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place with what is necessary, and close the place.
of cancer We have spoken in the division about the appearances of cancer, and how one should work with medicines, and how one should avoid the cure by iron;
and we speak of cancer engendered in the womb, and great caution is needed in the cure, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where one can scrape it as cancer which is in breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, one should remove it entirely when it is in the beginning;
nor did anyone cure it before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where one can remove it, as we have said, is that you sometimes purge the patient of black bile;
then have them bled if they have manifest repletion, then prepare the patient a good place to do the procedure;
then cast your hooks in the cancer, and remove it from all sides, and remove it from all parts without leaving anything;
and let the blood run all out, and press well the place with your hand or with something, and if the running of blood gives you trouble from the incision of the artery or the vein, then cauterize it until the blood is stanched; then treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already spoken in the division about the appearances of dropsy, and in what manner the collection of water is made, and the signs of each appearance, and the cure which is made by medicines, and that which is cured by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two appearances: that is to say, tympanites and hyposarca, for it is a deadly thing;
therefore when you treat this appearance of dropsy which is called "ascites" with medicines, and the cure does not profit, then look if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness than dropsy, such as cough and looseness of belly and similar things; do not touch it with iron, for there is doubt;
and if you see the patient of strong virtue, and they have no other illness than dropsy only, and they are neither too young nor too old, then you should work thus: lift the patient straight up with your hands, and let the assistants press the belly pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spiny spatula according to this form: And it should be sharp on both sides. with a point, and yet should not be so penetrating that it could reach the intestine when inserted, and cannot wound it;
then observe if the dropsy is generated near the intestines: if so, you must make an incision three fingers away from the navel, straight down towards the groin; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, make your incision three fingers to the left of the navel;
and if it's due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the waste fluids don't flow to this weakened spot;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the peritoneum as if skinning to the width of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the peritoneum until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is where the water is, then draw it out, and insert this instrument of which here is the form: And it resembles a thin silver tube, and is made of brass or light silver, and has a small hole in the lower part; and on one side, three holes; and two on another side, and one on another;
and the head is cut like a quill, and this is the form of the incision that the scribe uses to cut his quill:
at the upper end is the blade, so that when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately descends onto the instrument;
then empty half or a third of it, for if you empty more than necessary at that time, perhaps the patient might die from the dissolution of his soul's spirit, or he might faint, or approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of his strength, and according to what the condition of the patient's strength indicates, and his pulse;
then withdraw the instrument and retain the water, and it is immediately retained by the flesh that blocks the hole that is above the peritoneum, of which I spoke, that you pierce in this manner;
then reinsert the instrument the next day, if you see the patient tolerating this, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this for several days, and be careful not to act foolishly until only a little water remains.
And if you are concerned about the patient, and you leave much water, treat him with burial in hot sand, and by much sweating in the bath and in the sun, and have him abstain from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize over the stomach and over the liver and over the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no hole in the penis, or the hole is small, or it is not in its proper place.
So it must be pierced as soon as he is born with a very fine spatula according to this form:
then put a thin lead nail in the hole, and bind it and keep it thus for three or four days and when he needs to urinate, remove the nail, and let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes out will not let it close.
Those whose hole is small are treated with the lead nail, as we have said, so it will widen.
Those who do not have the hole in its proper place are impaired, for some are born who have the hole at the head of the penis, because of which they cannot urinate forward unless they lift their penis up; and cannot procreate because the matter cannot reach the womb, and this is a bad disease.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient lies supine on his back, then stretch the head of the penis and cut it like the cut of a quill, so that the hole falls in the middle, as it should;
and guard against blood flow which often comes, and if it happens, stanch it with that which stanches blood, and treat the wound until he is healed.
pustules of the penis Often these albathe (pustules) come on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
thus you should take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then put cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment on top; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the albathe is malignant, of foul color and stinking, then you should apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the albathe is on top of the penis, and has part inside the skin and part outside, then you should remove the albathe that is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat them together, the head of the penis is not secured from being pierced, and blackness and corruption comes to the top of the penis and to the testicle;
so you must remove all that is black and corrupted, then bind on top the plaster of honey and flour that is made from pomegranate peel and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then administer the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery thus helps with both conditions together: that is to say, the bleeding, and the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupted and retracted, then you should insert a lead tube into the penis canal, and let the patient urinate through it;
and when the skin is stuck to the head of the penis which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens because of a wound or abscess, then you must scrape it with a hollowed instrument, until the binding is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is difficult to separate this, then you should scrape a little of the head of the penis and the skin with a spatula;
then gently separate between the two, and put a fine linen cloth soaked in cold water there, so it doesn't stick again.
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however when we do this work of our own will, and especially on children, it is necessary that we do the best work, and the easiest for health.
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, for they do not use it in their law, and we have only what we have acquired through experiment.
For I have seen the greater part of the masters and lords who performed circumcision around a finger, and with scissors, and with a razor blade;
so the heart fled for there are two membranes, and by chance one cuts the upper one and the lower one remains. Now it must be cut again, and the pain is double, and with the cleaning that is done with the finger the point of the member is not secured;
and with the cleaning of the nail perhaps the iron escapes, and corrupts the work, and many times they are born such that they have no need of cleaning and I have seen it.
Of the cleaning that is done with scissors with all the thread binding, I have found the goodness of experiment, for the scissors cut justly as well above as below.
When you press your hand, cut evenly in a single motion; but let the thread be very tight around the skin;
and let the manner of the first operation be that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are doing nothing but tying the thread around the penis only, and then make him rejoice in all ways that you can;
then make him stand straight between your hands, and hide the scissors between your hands or under your feet so that the child doesn't see them, nor any of the instruments;
then push your hand to the penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it up until the head of the penis is inside; then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it a little below with another tie;
then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it a little below with another tie; and hold it with two fingers by the second tie with the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the foreskin above and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood run little by little, for that is best; and put powder on it and on the powder put a cloth glued with an egg yolk cooked and mixed with rose water, combined with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
The form of the scissors for the cleaning is this:
the two ends should be thin and sharp, and the ends should be as large as the handle evenly:
the error in cleaning is when the inner foreskin escapes during the incision;
then you must stretch it with your nail, before the place becomes swollen;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your nail, hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is below the penis is swollen, leave it until the hot swelling has subsided, and skin it lightly;
cut it as best you can, and guard against the part of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Then treat the place with wound-healing powders, which we have mentioned in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts the foreskin beyond measure, and it goes above, it will not harm;
treat it then, as we have said, until it is healed.
About the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from blockage by stone, or by congealed blood, or by pus, or by grown flesh, or by similar things, which we have mentioned in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see the retention is because of the stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, it is necessary that the patient be bent over his knees; and his feet should be put on his back, and his belly should stretch from the part above the back, and the patient should hold his breath as long as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constrained to expel the stone upward, whereby the urine is released;
and if it doesn't come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, it is necessary that you administer extraction with the instrument which is called "syringe," of which here is the form:
and it should be of subtle light silver, hollow like a bird's feather; and the tube should be one and a half palms long, and be subtle at the end.
And the manner of the urine's exit is that you take a double thread, and tie at the end a bit of wool or cotton, and push the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut the excess wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a seat, and sprinkle his bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently put the syringe in the penis, until it comes to the root of the penis, then double the penis above toward the belly;
then push the syringe forward until the bladder, and let the patient feel it come to the empty thing, and this is not done according to this order except because the passage where it goes is twisted;
then extend the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out, and let the urine flow;
and restart with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When there are abrasions or blood in the bladder, or pus has gathered there, and you want to distill waters and medicines into it, do so with the instrument called "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has 3 holes: 2 on one side, and 1 on the other, as you can see;
and the hollow place through which the medicine flows should be such that it blocks the penis well without addition, so that one can draw out moisture and push when needed;
and when you want to inject your medicines into the bladder, put the head of the catheter in the moisture, and pull on the plunger that is inside;
so you will draw the moisture into the catheter, and then push the plunger back in firmly; thus the moisture will enter and come to the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one administers an enema to the bladder:
And it is made of silver or brass, and the head is higher;
and below there is a groove where the binding falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the moisture with which you want to give an enema to the bladder, then tie it firmly between the two grooves with a good double thread, and heat this moisture a little over the fire;
then push the head of the clyster into the penis, then press your hand on the bladder with all the moisture appropriately, until the patient feels that this moisture has already reached the bladder;
and if you don't have the bladder, take a piece of parchment, and make a circle of it, and pierce it round about; then push a strong thread through these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a thimble, and put inside what you want of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.
about the stone
We have already spoken in the division about the types of stone, and extraction together with medicines;
and I have spoken of the difference between stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stone one should operate by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder happens more often to children, and this is a sign that the water jumps from the bladder resembling water in its subtlety;
and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs many times, and then becomes rigid; and in many of these the fundament protrudes;
and the healing of children is easy until they are 4 years old, and is very difficult in old men, and is medium in young ones, those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the cure, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient by clyster, to draw out all the waste that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and push him and move him below, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes jumps from the high place;
then make him sit prepared between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is all declining downward;
then search for it and touch inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, hasten immediately to cut upon the stone.
And if it doesn't fall completely to the touch, moisten your index finger with oil of your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a mature youth; and push it into his fundament, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press down with your finger, and push it outward there where you want to cut.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and command him to extend with his right hand the testicles upward, and with his left hand remove the skin that is below the testicles in the part where one makes the cut;
then push in the cutting spatula, of which this is the form: And make an incision between what is between the testicles and the anus, not in the middle but on the left side of the buttock;
and be directly above the stone, and your finger should always be in the anus, and the cut should be crosswise so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure of the finger that is in the anus will make it jump out without effort;
and know that there are stones that have angles and edges: these are difficult to remove;
and there are those that are smooth, resembling an acorn, and round, whose removal is easy.
For those that have angles and edges, make the cut larger;
and if it doesn't come out, you must grip it with forceps that have a file-like head, to better grip the stone so it doesn't escape; or push underneath it a subtle instrument curved at the tip;
and if you cannot manage it thus, enlarge the opening a little, and if blood flows, staunch it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, push the largest one first to the neck of the bladder, then cut above it, then draw it out, and the small ones after if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawed, and make a larger wound. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine always comes through there because the place cannot heal;
but nevertheless strive to extract it, or to break it with forceps, until you extract it in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and tighten it, and put above it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to calm the hot inflammation; then lay the patient back on his neck, and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
And when you remove it, water the area well with oil and water, then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot inflammation comes to the wound and corrosion, and blood clots in the bladder, and because of this the urine is retained, which is known in such a way that blood comes out with the urine: then put your finger in the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will corrupt the bladder, and rot it;
then wash the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and help it in all the ways that you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat it, that you bind the two thighs, and apply the medicines to the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the conduit of the penis, and stuck inside, and the urine cannot come out; then treat it with what I said before, that you cut it many times, one is excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven this thus.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be with three angles fixed in a handle:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder;
then push the drill into the penis gently, until it comes to the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone through to the other side;
the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the penis. It is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, tie a thread below the stone and another above, then split the penis right at the stone between the two ties, then extract it out, and untie the tie, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
on the stone in women
It rarely happens that stone is formed in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will reveal herself to physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third manner is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-versed in this manual art;
and the fourth manner is that the stone in women is deeper than the stone in men, which is why it requires making a deeper cut, and there is great fear. And if necessity compels this, you must take a well-knowing female physician, and she is hardly found, and if you don't find one, then seek a skillful chaste physician;
and present to him a midwife well-versed in women's lives, or a woman who knows part of the art, and command her to do what you command regarding the investigation of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the fundament and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should constrain it under her finger, and command her to insert her finger into the sick woman's vagina, and search and press her left hand firmly above the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downward, until it comes to the root of the thigh;
then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh opposite the middle of the vagina, there where it is most apparent, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the cut be small at first;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the cut be small at first; then insert the probe into the cut, if you feel the stone then increase the wound until the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large and rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have branches.
so know their appearances to know the outcome.
And if blood overcomes you, put ground vitriol on the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stanched;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about in the extraction of stones in men to help you in your work;
and if blood overcomes you, and it's from the artery that is cut, put the powder on the place and pack it with tents and bandages, and don't start this again, and leave the stone and don't draw it out, for perhaps the patient would die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is calmed, and the place suppurates, return to your work, until the stone is out.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture in the white syfac, which is below the skin of the testicles, that contains the egg;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the egg, so that one thinks it is another egg; and this is the skin of the testicle between the white syfac that we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread out.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: either it's a color declining to yellow, or it's red blood, or black, or watery white, and this happens more often;
and these are the signs to recognize this collection, for if it is in the white syfac that we mentioned, the swelling is round, a bit long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle doesn't appear, for it has moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper membrane, the swelling is round with a part of the egg, and because of this one thinks it is another egg;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white syfac, one feels it well;
thus when you want to know the color of the moisture, test it with the square probe, whose form is shown before this. According to what comes after the probe, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body;
then lay him on his back, on something slightly elevated, and put many cloths under him;
then sit on his left, and command the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two sides of the heart of the testicles;
then take the broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles through the middle lengthwise up to near the groin, and let your incision be completely straight while dividing the skin of the testicles up to the white membrane, and peel it back carefully according to your ability;
then pierce the membrane full of water with a wide hole, and draw out all the water, and then put your hooks, and stretch the membrane upward;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the membrane; cut all or in pieces especially its thin side, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the egg comes out during your work, return it to its place when you have completed the work on the membrane;
then join the two lips of the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted by another illness, it is necessary that you tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with all the suspensory, and extract the egg, and treat it as we have said.
And if water is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two hernias; so cut the other part as you did the first equally, then dry the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
so cut the other part as you did the first equally, then dry the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and put outside other wool soaked in wine and oil, and put it on the two testicles, and put doubled cloths above, and tie it up with the bandage that is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this appearance and let them be joined by stitching in the gusset of the breeches, and let one of the ends reach from the fundament to the back, and the other to the part of the groin;
and the other two ends on the two angles, and let all the constraint be gathered in the buckle of the belt;
and sometimes this hernia is treated with cautery instead of iron cutting, and it is that you take a subtle knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white membrane that contains the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that membrane with hooks, and peel it with this subtle hot cautery:
And cut it in all the ways that you can, until you remove everything;
and ensure that the fire does not touch the egg;
and know that this procedure is safer; and better at preventing blood flow, and better than the cutting operation;
and if anything causes you trouble, whether hot abscess or blood flow or something else, then treat what causes you trouble, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful, and does not want to endure this operation because of its horribleness, then administer perforation, as I tell you, and it is that when you are quite certain by the signs we have mentioned that it is a watery hernia there, make the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with the broad spatula, and make the perforation lengthwise of the body;
and let the hole be wide, so that all the water runs out;
then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and leave it for the remainder of the water to run out, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not let the water out at the mouth of the wound, it is necessary that you insert a quill or the instrument with which one draws water from dropsy patients, of which the form is shown before;
and widen the wound a little, and know that the water returns, and is gathered after six months or thereabouts, and when it is gathered as before, and thus will the patient pass his days.
Know that in the cutting of this hernia there is fear in several conditions, which is why it seems better to me to leave it;
and I will tell you the procedure and the appearances of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses come to the body, and especially to the testicles; and this happens for many reasons.
That is to say by sour and acute superfluity, which is spread to the testicles, or from percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and finds no pain, and is a serious abscess;
and by chance it is a serious frightening and purulent abscess, and of dark color, and sometimes comes from an arterial knot, or from swelling of a vein.
When it is from an arterial knot, it is known by the disposition of hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it.
The one that is made from swelling of a vein is known by its disposition to the expression of touching with fingers, and one can well make the cut on this appearance, and on the other flesh; and it is that you cut the heart of the testicles, then extend the egg upward, and pull it out of the white membrane, and free the suspensory from all parts of the egg.
If the egg is already soldered with these born flesh, then you must pull the egg, and cut it;
and if it is attached to the membrane, or in that which is inside the vessels, then you must free all that membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the birth of the flesh is in the back place, then you must cut it all, and extract the egg, as we have said.
And when your procedure is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
This is an abscess wrapped in a wrapping similar to a bud, with the softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the cure of this disease is almost as frightening as the one before, and yet we will tell you the procedure for it, according to what the ancients did.
One must make the patient sit on a raised seat, then push down the suspensory of the testicles with your fingers, with all the vessels that are close to the rod, and the master should hold them, and extend them strongly;
then cut with the broad cutting spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then skin from each part, as we have said in the extraction of arteries that are in temples;
then stick a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the living tissue has come, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and extract the corrupted moisture;
then treat the wound like the others where pus is generated, so that some vessels fall that nourish one of the testicles;
for by this no harm comes, and if to all vessels comes living tissue, then one must extract the testicles with all the vessels; so that the egg does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and they dry up and cannot help themselves.
The occurrence of this hernia is by the cut that comes in the membrane, or the extension on the belly in the part of the groins, whereby the intestines descend from this rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the membrane, or of its extension, and these two types come from many causes:
either from percussion, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting heavy weights, and from similar things;
and the signs when it is from the extension of the membrane, is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscess is equal up to the depth, because the membrane presses the intestine.
And the sign when it is from the cutting of the membrane, is that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess appears diverse, close under the skin, and this is because of the exit of the intestine and the body to the outside of the membrane.
And sometimes the omentum descends with the intestine, and is retained there, and causes great pain to the patient, especially when it is pressed.
And in these iron cures there is fear, which is why they must be avoided.
And the manner of the operation is that you command the patient to return the intestine with his hand inside the wound, if it can re-enter; then he should lie on his back between your hands, and raise his thighs;
then stretch the scrotum above, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then push inside the lips of the cut hooks according to what you need to open the wound, and it should be such that the testicle can come out;
then flay the fascia that is under the skin of the testicles, until the white hard fascia is uncovered on all sides;
then push your index finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between the white fascia that is under the skin of the testicle, and between the second fascia, and separate what is behind the testicle, and between the second fascia;
and then move with the right hand inside the scrotum, and stretch the white fascia up with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all the fascia toward the cut; and command the assistant to stretch the testicle upward, and untie what is attached behind the binding;
and search with your fingers if there is any intestine wrapped in the hard white fascia, and if you find any, push it into the belly below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of 10 threads, and push it into the back part of the fascia, which is after the skin of the testicles; after the cut, then cut the heads that appear from the threads, until there are 4 threads; then gather them one above the other in the manner of a cross, and bind with it the fascia, of which we have spoken which is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong binding of 2 parts; then wrap the heads of the threads, and tie them strongly in 2 parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter them, lest hot abscess come there; and put again the binding according to the first binding long 2 fingers from that one, and after these 2 bindings leave from the fascia which is under the scrotum the width of a finger; and after all the other according to the roundness that the testicle carries;
then cut in the part that is under the skin of the testicles, until the blood runs, and the pus, as we have said before;
then apply wool moistened in oil, and put in wounds, and apply the binding that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white fascia that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of blood flow. For this happens many times, and leave the binding until it falls by itself;
and if it is slow to fall, then let it be sprinkled with hot water, and put on it what we have mentioned, until it falls;
then treat the wound with other treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this hernia I never saw anyone who dared to perform the cure by iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the hernia that is near the penis, in such a way that you bind the vessels, after cutting above them lightly below;
then cut in the middle, and treat the abscess with what works, until the vessels fall;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
A rupture sometimes occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the area appears;
and none of the intestines descend to the testicles, and if any descend, it's little, and always returns;
and nevertheless if it remains too long in this state, the wound in the peritoneum grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens due to the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we have said, for it is stretched, then the area becomes softened and swollen and appears;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: the patient should lie supine on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen area of the rupture widthwise according to the width of three fingers;
and then extract the peritoneum which is under the skin that follows it, then take the probe and place it on the visible area of the peritoneum;
and press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two visible areas of the peritoneum over the head of the probe, and sew one and the other;
then withdraw the head of the probe, and do not cut any of the peritoneum nor extend the egg or anything else, as I have informed you in the cure of intestinal hernia; then treat it with the cure for wounds.
then treat it with the cure for wounds. And when you cut the threads, clean it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The peritoneum is constrained, and there is no appearance in the rupture, and cautery is better in this area, and closer to healing.
On the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh that is inside is softened, and it is ugly to see;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, to make the patient lie on his back, and cut the skin that is softened above the natural skin;
then join the two lips with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and treat it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
On castration
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is necessary only for two reasons:
one is that the physician knows how to respond when asked about it, and knows its cure;
and the other, because we often need castration of certain animals to help us, such as billy goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say therefore that castration is done according to two methods: either by traction, or by incision.
In that which we do by traction, we make the animal sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand, until they are reduced and you no longer feel them.
On castration by cutting: it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory, and cut above each egg with one cut, when you have well skinned them;
and leave some small amount of the peritoneum and the subtle peritoneum which is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by traction, because with traction there perhaps remains something of the testicles, whereby the animal desires luxury;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
On hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is of two types in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the figure of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows from it.
And the other type is in women, and has above the pubic area something like a rod and two testicles.
And the cure for the man and the woman is that you cut all the joined flesh, and treat them like other wounds;
in the second type, of men whose urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
The clitoris is flesh added above the natural part, such that it is very ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the treatment.
You must hold the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with hooks, and cut it carefully;
and do not go too deep, lest bleeding occur, then treat it with other treatment until it is healed;
and there is another flesh that grows at the mouth of the womb, and fills it, and by chance protrudes out, and is like a tail in appearance, and for this reason the ancients called it "tailed disease." So you must cut it, as we have said for the clitoris, and treat it until it is healed.
Obstruction is when the woman's nature is not pierced, or the opening is small; and it is natural from birth, or accidental from disease that has come there;
and it is natural from birth, or accidental from disease that has come there; or it is from added flesh, or from thin or thick membrane, and is made deep in the womb, or on the sides, or below, or wherever;
and it prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps having menstrual flow;
and the knowledge of this is through the midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is near and visible, then probe with your fingers or with the probe.
If it is from thin membrane, and it is near the two lips, then hasten, and break it thus:
put your two index fingers together, and let the woman lie on her back, with her legs spread;
then spread the two lips firmly, until the thin membrane is broken, and the obstruction is opened;
then take wool, and soak it in oil, and put it on the place, and let the woman lie with a man each day, so that it cannot heal shut.
And if the membrane is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula shaped like a myrtle leaf.
If the obstruction is from grown flesh, then suspend it with the hook and cut it;
and have blood-staunching medicines ready, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, mixed with egg white;
then apply a wide lead tube, so that the wound cannot heal shut;
and thus let it be for a long time, and apply a dry linen tent;
then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And when grown flesh comes in the womb, it must be cut according to this method, unless it is cancerous growths. For the cancerous growth that is in the womb, one should not touch it with iron.
About hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become theli [polyps];
and we have already said in the division their appearances, and the signs, and I will say here those which receive treatment.
I say that hemorrhoids and theli, when they are deep in the womb, and they do not appear to touch, then treatment by iron is not appropriate.
Those that are at the mouth of the womb, that can be felt, are those that can be treated.
It is necessary then that you put the woman in a cold room, then stretch the theli with forceps, and cut it at its roots, then powder with blood-restraining medicines, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then push her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if bleeding occurs there, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peel and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster of it on her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, then make her apply cupping glasses to her back and breasts without cutting;
then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or in wild rose juice with old wine, and make it adhere to the place.
And when the swelling subsides, then treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough head, so it must be cut as I have said for the theli; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many types of abscesses come to the womb, such as cancer and purulent abscess and herpes and gangrene and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and several other diseases that I have mentioned in the classification.
It is therefore necessary that I speak in this treatise of the hot abscess that comes to the womb, which is not one of the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you want to know about the work with iron, then observe if the abscess is acute at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Thus do not hurry to pierce it, but let it ripen until the pain is eased;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where she reclines, and support her back and bring her feet to the outer parts of the leg;
and let her thighs be spread, and put her arms under her knees, and tie them well with a good binding;
then have her lean toward the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the womb, of which the form comes hereafter;
and it is necessary that when you want to administer this instrument, that you first insert the probe to know the depth of the womb, so that what enters of the instrument doesn't go deeper than it should, and that it doesn't hurt the patient; and if the instrument is too large, it is necessary to cover the depth of the womb with cloths, so that the instrument doesn't harm it;
and it is necessary that one put the horn of the instrument above, and that one hold the instrument.
And when the abscess appears, and one feels it soft by hand, it is necessary to cut at the head, with the broad spatula;
and when the pus is emptied, it is necessary that you put in the wound tents moistened in rose oil, or in dry green oil;
and put the tent outside the wound at the depth of the womb, and put outside on the womb and on the groin clean wool moistened in water where mallows have been cooked;
then treat it after 2 days with an ointment suitable for this, until it is healed;
and sometimes one washes the womb and the wound with an enema of water and honey, and then with water where lily roots and long aristolochia have been cooked; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is hidden in the womb, it is necessary that you avoid cauterizing with iron, but treat it as we have said in the classification.
On childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife to recognize the figure of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman press downward, and desire to smell the air:
then the child hastens to come out; then know that this childbirth is according to the natural figure, and the exit is under its head, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, it is necessary to press gently on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends on its head, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good purification;
and one who comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For sometimes it comes on its feet, and the body or the head comes out, and the hands, or it comes on its belly, or supine, and is turned by chance on its neck, and by other bad figures;
so it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in these things, and to beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the figures how one should help her.
If the child comes on its head by natural exit, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, then make her sit on a chair, or have the women hold her;
and sprinkle her nature with oil where fenugreek has been cooked, and then the midwife pushes between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the form: and split the afterbirth, and cut with her nail until the moisture that is inside runs out;
and press the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it doesn't descend, it is necessary to give the woman an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil;
then make her take and sneeze from condisi, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: thus the child will come out immediately.
And if both hands come out, it is necessary that you return them gently little by little; and if they cannot enter, put the woman on a seat, and raise her feet high; then push the seat to the ground, and hold the woman, so she doesn't fall during the pushing;
and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, cut off the hands with the knife that was mentioned before, and extract the child, and bring it back evenly.
about the delivery of the child by its feet When the child comes by its feet, it must be pushed upward; and then turn it little by little, until it is straight;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it comes out up to the thighs, order her to push, and make her sneeze with condisi; it will come out, if God wills.
And if it doesn't come out as we have said, turn it little by little, until it is in the natural position. For then it comes out easily.
And if it doesn't come out as we have said, take marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and melted gum, and grind all in a mortar; and put this ointment on the woman's nature inside and outside, then make her sit in lukewarm water up to below the ribs;
and when she is softened below, make her a pessary of myrrh, and put it below, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and hold her mouth and nose, and press her belly gently, for the child will come out immediately.
about the delivery of the child on its knees When the child comes in this form, the midwife should put her hands in little by little; then she should be laid back on her neck, with feet hanging down, and be lying on a bed; and fold her hands little by little, and then press her hands on the belly, and remove the cushions from below, until she is positioned downward; and if the child doesn't come out, take its feet and move them strongly, then move the belly upward, then put your hands in; and help the child little by little; and order the woman to push until the child comes out.
about the delivery of the child who comes sideways with one hand hanging It is necessary to devise a way to return the hand: if one cannot return it, make the woman get up and walk;
if she cannot walk, make her lie on a bed, and push her legs strongly;
then administer the mucilage that I have described;
and if she doesn't deliver, make her sit on a seat, then work on returning the hand; and help the child into the natural position, and make her sneeze, and order her to push until the child comes out.
about the delivery of the child on its neck, with hands spread out, and face turned toward its mother's back It is necessary that the midwife hold her hand, then turn it little by little, and help it gently;
and when it is straight, put marshmallow mucilage and oil on the nature, as we have said, then order her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, make her sit on a seat, and order her to push; and make her sneeze. about this same manner with the afterbirth
about this same manner with the afterbirth When it comes out in this manner with the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your nail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the navel, so it is not retained, and the child dies;
then push the child inside, until you have put it as it should be, and order the woman to push sometimes:
about the delivery of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, though it happens rarely. Two are a strange thing, and do not live, except rarely;
Two are a strange thing, and do not live, except rarely; I know this, that they are multiplied, and are separated by the membrane that divides them, which is tied to the navel;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single one, as we have said.
And if they come out with difficulty, then treat as we have said, and let the midwife be subtle, and do quickly and lightly what she does; and do thus as it is better for health. of multiple children
Sometimes there are formed in the womb 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7, or more up to 15, and they are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the glorious sage, and it is proper that the midwife knows all this, for by chance such a thing may happen to her; so let her do according to what is proper.
of the dead child
When you treat the woman with a dead child in the womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to work with hands; so it is proper that you know if the woman is of sound strength, and has no condition where she fears death;
so it is proper that the woman be laid on her back, and her head be inclined downward, and the legs raised;
and the assistant should hold her from two sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mucilage of marshmallow and fenugreek and linseed, then let the midwife anoint her hands with these oils and these mucilages;
then insert them into the womb gently, then seek a place where she can insert the hooks that are suitable for this, and take care if the child is positioned to descend head first;
so fix the hooks in his eyes or in his neck or in his mouth or in his palate or under the chin or in the chest or near the ribs, and if the descent is feet first, fix them in the groin and at the middle ribs;
and it is proper that she hold the hook with her right hand, and put the curve between the fingers of her left hand, and insert it with her whole hand gently, and fix the hook in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it comes to the empty space;
then fix against it another hook, or a third if you have need of it, so that the extraction is even;
and then pull evenly while moving from one side to the other, for better exit, and let the hooks be toothed for better grip, as here is the form:
And if a part remains, let the midwife anoint some of her fingers with oil, and insert them in that part, and pull the other part;
and if any remains, put this hook in the highest place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and it cannot be brought back due to the constriction, it is proper that you wrap it in a cloth, until it comes out completely; then cut it at the joint of the palm or at the elbow, and thus you must do with the other hand, and with the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and it is narrow at the exit, or if there is water gathered in the head, it is proper that you insert the spiny spatula between your fingers, and split the head and extract the water; or you break it with the instrument that is called "almidach," whose form comes with the instruments in the chapter that is after this one;
and likewise do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head comes out and is constricted at the chest, let it be split, until the moisture that is in the chest comes out;
and if it cannot come out, cut it in pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or below the ribs, it is proper that you pierce it until the moisture runs out.
And if the child is feet first, the pulling is easy, and the straightening to the mouth of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or chest, you should pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut the belly or chest until the moisture that is there flows out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, the midwife should push her hand deep into the womb, and pull it to the mouth of the womb; then insert one or two hooks, and pull it out;
and if the mouth of the womb is contracted due to hot swelling that has come there, one should not labor at it, but rather administer moist and fatty substances; and administer plasters to her, and let her sit in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can place it evenly, administer what we have said for the living child;
and if one cannot do this, pull it out in pieces, and leave none of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, administer to her what we have said about hot swellings that come in the womb;
and if bleeding occurs, put her in astringent water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose belly a child had died, then she conceived another upon that one, and the other also died. After a long time, a swelling came to her navel, and swelled so much that it opened, and began to suppurate greatly.
I was called to treat it, and I tended it for a long time, and the wound could not heal.
I put on a strongly drawing plaster, and a bone came out, and after some days another one. I marveled greatly, because there are no bones in the belly.
Then I thought that these were the bones of a dead child.
I probed the wound, and drew out many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time thus, and a little pus always came from the place;
and I have only recorded this chapter so that, when the master finds a strange thing, he might know how to provide help.
Here follows the form of the press, with which one opens the lips;
and it has two turning parts at the two ends of the two bands. However, the handles should be more delicate than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the wood should be one finger wide, and the margin of the trees one finger, and one and a half palms long; and in the middle of the two bands should be two joinings of this same wood, which should be fixed in one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two joinings are inserted in the mouth of the womb to open it when one turns the two handles.
Another form, in its appearance more delicate and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, in the likeness of tongs; and it should have at the two ends two joinings, as you see, one palm long and two fingers wide;
and when you want to open the womb with the instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, feet hanging and legs open, then push the two joined joinings together into the womb, and hold the head of the instrument below between her thighs; then open your hand with the instrument, as you have done with the tongs evenly, according to the amount that you want to open the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
These instruments are all surpassed, and their forms are multiplied; and when the physician has them prepared, the work is more rapid, and more noble to men for their quantity.
So do not despise the instrument that you have not prepared, for their necessity is not excusable.
When the placenta is retained during childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze using condisi, and press your hands against her mouth and nose; and if it comes out by this means, good.
If not, then take a pot and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia lignea, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be cooked in water in the pot over the fire;
then put a reed in the hole of the pot, and the other end at the mouth of the womb, and hold it there until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. The placenta will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to wet her left hand in sesame oil or in marshmallow mucilage, and then insert it into the birth canal, and search for the placenta; and when she has found it, she should take it and extend it little by little straight out, so that the womb does not fall during the extraction;
but it should be moved gently to the right and to the left, and then pulled; thus it will come and detach itself.
And if the mouth of the womb is already narrowed, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing and fumigation with herbs;
and if it doesn't come out with all that we have said, be careful not to be reckless in pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, you tie it to the woman's thigh, then treat her with tetrapharmacon ointment; thus it will rot and soften, and come out;
however, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Therefore suitable fumigations are needed for this:
some of the ancients have tested fumigation with watercress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for retained menses and placenta is this:
And it is made of glass resembling a reed, and one puts the thin end in the birth canal, and the wide end over the fire;
and the fumigation should be over coals, and hold it until it is spent, and begin another.
Many children are born without the anus being pierced, instead it is blocked by a thin membrane: therefore the midwife must pierce this membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp spatula, and should be careful not to touch the sphincter;
then put wool soaked in wine and oil on it, then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you fear it might close again, put a lead tube in the opening, and leave it for several days, and remove it when the child needs to go to the chambers.
And sometimes this blockage comes from the healing of a wound or abscess; thus it is necessary to cut this scar: it should be treated, as we have said, with the lead tube.
Fistulas that come below the anus are nodules and swellings that come beside the anus outside, or in the space between the two parts, having one fistula or several;
and when this nodule is old, it opens, and watery white moisture or thin pus runs out, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating;
and they are known by the fact that either feces or wind comes out when the patient defecates, and perhaps a worm comes out.
And there are fistulas that penetrate to the bladder, and to the middle of the penis; and they reach to the hip joint, and to the tailbone.
And thus one recognizes a penetrating versus non-penetrating fistula of the anus: which is that you put your index finger in the anus, and insert a thin brass or iron needle into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, insert a thin lead probe, or a horse hair, until you feel the probe or hair with your finger;
and if you don't feel it, and neither feces nor wind nor worms come from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not penetrate; so hasten to treat it.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary tract, urine leaks out, and it cannot be healed by medicines.
If it penetrates to the hip joint, then the probe reaches to that place; if there is no tortuosity and the pain is found around it, then pus constantly comes out, and neither medicine nor healing ointment helps;
and for these penetrating fistulas there is no cure except labor, and the vanity of foolish physicians who meddle with it.
In one that is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope for health through iron, as I have proven, and it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back;
and raise his legs up to his thighs, and let his thighs be inclined to his belly; then insert a probe of brass, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the probe goes.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you should insert your index finger, if you then feel that the probe has penetrated it;
and it should be exposed where you feel between your finger the membrane or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; so do not labor at it for it cannot be healed.
Nevertheless, they say that some can be healed, but this happens rarely;
and the help that is done there is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as was said before; and insert it hot into the fistula, until it comes near the fundament; and do this 2 or 3 times, until you know that these felted flesh pieces, which are similar to a bird's feather, are burned;
and then treat it with probes moistened in butter, until that flesh comes out, then treat it with ointment generating flesh and healing.
If it is thus healed, that is good.
If not, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the probe enters, and does not penetrate to the finger which is in the fundament, and there is between your finger and the probe a thick covering of flesh or membrane, and you see the fistula at what follows the covering of the heart; then cut it from the beginning of the fistula, and keep pushing the probe forward, and then the cautery after it, until it comes to the head of the probe; and the probe will be freed, and will fall;
then clean those felted flesh pieces that resemble a bird's feather, and let none remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and runs between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
For the cautery of fire combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of these joined flesh pieces, and the stanching of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat it with probes moistened in butter or in crushed cabbage, until the place discharges pus, and the burned flesh comes out in the pus;
then treat the wound with healing ointments generating hard flesh, and these are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if the fistula comes to the depth of the fundament, and is far from the body, then insert your finger in the fundament, and investigate this.
If you feel the probe, and between the two is the membrane or the membrane or flesh, or it is close to piercing, then there is only a way of trust and hope, through the administration of one of three ways:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can then put probes and treat as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the tendon that holds the fundament, and excrement comes out there without will; then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you separate that covering and clean it after it is cut near the fundament, either by probe or by another pointed instrument; then clean that felted flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then study to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament:
then study to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament: thus it will be an easier thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are of this type: it is when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on the side of the fundament near the skin above, then take a probe pierced at the head in this form: And put a twisted thread in two, and push the probe with all the thread into the fistula until it reaches the end.
If it penetrates into the margin of the fundament inside, then pull the thread from this hole, while you put your finger in the fundament;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and tighten one to the other, and leave it for a day or two;
and tighten it sometimes, until the thread cuts through the flesh that is between the two, and they fall;
then treat the wound until it is sealed and healed.
If the fistula does not pierce through, make it pierce in all the ways that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to make the lacing cut so deep, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The form of the thorny spatula used to split the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and not on the other side, so that one does not cut what should not be cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the fundament, like grape seeds, and there are small and large ones, and blood flows from them constantly, and there is one or several, and they are outside the fundament and at the end of the fundament;
but those that are outside have little moisture, and there flows constantly either a little citrine water or a little blood, and they have the color of the body;
and the treatment of those who have them inside the fundament is that you command the patient to strain to go to the chambers, until the fundament comes out, and the threads appear; then hurry, and grasp it with forceps, or hold it with your nail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, take them with a cloth, or with cotton, or with a piece of camelot; and pull them with your fingers, then cut them, and powder above with some hot powders that serve as cautery; or cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until healed;
and if the fundament cannot come out, then give the patient an enema with mordant and harsh clyster to wash what is in the fundament, so that it can come out openly; when the patient strains, and if the threads are outside the fundament, then the treatment is easy;
when the patient strains, and if the threads are outside the fundament, then the treatment is easy; and it is that you take them with your nail or with forceps, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until healed, and that he fears the incision by iron. So it is necessary that you administer the suture in this way:
So it is necessary that you administer the suture in this way: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and tighten the thread strongly, then tie the thread, and pull out the needle, and do so with all the others, and leave one for the superfluity of blood to flow;
then put on the fundament a cloth soaked in rose oil or in cerate, and put it on the fundament, and command the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall, and when they have fallen, treat them with ointment and other treatment, until healed.
about the drying of waste in the fundament Many times occurs drying of waste in the intestine, and by constraint of nature, and when the malady is old and medicine is of no use. So it is necessary that you scrape with the point of a spatula or with your nail the crust above, which does not let it moisten; then treat it until it is sealed as necessary;
and if it cannot seal, then begin the scraping stronger than before, until it bleeds much, and is scraped raw; then treat it until it is healed.
about the ant-bite/formication Formication is a small deceptive appearance around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes the cold finds it, and one feels it like an ant bite, and it comes in all the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a reed from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place this reed over the ant-bite, so that the circle encompasses the ant-bite all around; then turn your hand with the reed until you cut all around the ant-bite, and put it deep, and pull out the ant-bite from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron reed according to this form, and let it be thin below and pulling above: not pierced, to better hold with the finger, and better press.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant-bite, as it is described before in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes one makes clysters of silver or white copper, or of melted or hammered brass;
and sometimes one makes these instruments small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those then that one administers in the treatment of children and those who are weak and in pain, are small.
Those then that one administers in the treatment of children and those who are weak and in pain, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is wide above, where the belly is tied in this manner:
and there should be a separation where the belly is tied, as you see, and the head should be pierced inside;
and it should have on one side 2 holes, and on the other 1;
and the belly where one puts the medicines should be of an animal bladder or parchment, and should be pierced all around with small holes, and have between each hole 1 finger's width, then push into these holes a strong thread of raw twisted thread in 10 or thereabouts, and assemble the belly as is a goat; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then give the clyster;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or similar thing, then insert it gently; then let the assistant squeeze it with his two hands together, until it is all empty, then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, let him hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps a night with it all, it is of greater help.
And if you give him a clyster in illness of running belly, and the medicine hastens to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids in the fundament, or abscess, let the clyster be as thin as for a child;
and this is the form of the thin clyster on which the skin should be tightened:
We have already spoken in the division about the treatment of wounds;
now we will tell you about the treatments by hand and medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are different according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and by what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing of stone, and cut of sword and knife, or of lance or of wood or of arrow, or of similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, such as wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the treatment of each wound, and will begin with simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, take note if it is from throwing of stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rising of hot abscess: then immediately make him bleed from the cephalic vein especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side of the wounded part;
and let the patient avoid repletion of wine and gross meats.
And if he doesn't want to bleed, then his food should be reduced, and he should not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if hot swelling comes, cotton soaked in rose oil only, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot swelling, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it has not been changed by the air, powder, which I will describe a little later;
and if the air has changed it, then put some ointments on it, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large as from a sword cut or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together with tents, then join them with stitches, as I will describe for wounds of the belly, about the stitching.
If the wound is exposed to the bone, and hanging, and only holds by a little, then cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and order the patient to eat substantial foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, like porridge, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it doesn't adhere to the bone, then cut away all the rotted part, and throw it out, then treat it;
and if there is an artery in the wound or vein, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then seek the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if that doesn't help, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, then the treatment is easy: and it is that you put in this powder which seals before the air has changed it.
And the manner of the powder is thus: take one part incense; dragon's blood two parts; quicklime three parts, and powder finely, and fill the wound, and press strongly, until it adheres well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it without unbinding, unless it swells; for one doesn't remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one does this with quicklime only, when one doesn't have the incense nor the dragon's blood, but only if the air hasn't changed the wound.
And if the air has changed the wound, especially in summer, then one doesn't put this powder on it;
but put on some digestive ointments, or powder of barley flour made with water and honey, until it discharges pus; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if bone breakage comes with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine pincers;
and I will tell you later about breaks of the head.
about the wound of the neck
If a wound comes to the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave the treatment, and put nothing constraining on it, for it harms the nerves and makes them retract; and put nothing cold on the wound, for the substance of nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be gentle, such as lime washed in sweet water, and mixed with rose oil, and cadmia washed also in sweet water, and other mineral stones according to this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, then sew it and bind with bandages, then treat until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is hollowed and full of pus, then pierce it at the lowest point;
and if the artery is cut, and blood flow comes from it, then separate it, and tie it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the flesh, and the passage is preserved, through which food goes, then sew the flesh over the windpipe, and do not touch the throat but put it back according to its natural shape; and then bind it properly, and leave it some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression in the bone, then seek it; and if there are pieces of bone, then pull them all out if you can, and those that you cannot have, leave until the wound rots, and the exit is separated and eased;
and if the wound is fresh, then powder on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, then treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it's a strike from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, observe if air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it's not deep, and it's fresh with all its blood, do not put powder on it in the first hour, and do not bind it because of the blood that might remain deep inside, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but put on it drawing ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you don't have ointment, put old cotton in the wound to draw out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for 3 days, or 4, or more; thus spasm will not come, nor bad trembling of the heart nor tightening of breath; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is saved. Treat it then with probes and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and opens, know then that there is a fistula;
treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a cut of sword or knife, and it is simple, on the chest or back, treat it as mentioned before; if it is large, with stitching;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is pressed into the bone, and has cut pieces, examine the wound, and pull them out if they are separated; and if they are not separated, let the wound rot, thus extraction will be easier;
and for other wounds on other limbs the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large and medium and small;
from the large wound sometimes emerge the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, whereby their introduction;
and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because one puts back the intestines with more difficulty if one doesn't put them back while they're still warm;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, thus they go back in with more difficulty, and therefore the medium wound is better, because one returns the intestine to its place better than in the other two.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to 4 manners:
the 2 common sutures occur in the suture of the belly, and the suture of other wounds of the body and 2 other proper sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more proper with the suture of the belly, and I will tell of each one and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put back, this is by one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: wet a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or cook in water galangal and cypress and spikenard, and moisten the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes astringent wine does this, and is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling departing, moisten the intestine with water where althaea and mallows have been cooked, for by this the entry is eased with little effort;
and if it cannot enter, split the wound a little with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, as none should cut without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting:
it cuts inside on the curve and not outside, and here is its form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine jumps out, put it back according to its natural form in its proper place, if you have the power, for this is better.
When the wound is wide, and it is in the lower part of the belly, it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the part below the belly, put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts put your attention to making the wounded part higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, put what you have prepared, then have between your hands a careful assistant who holds the entire rupture in their hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common manner of sutures, and it is that you take one needle or several, according to the size of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound a finger's width of space, and stick in it a needle which has a good strong thread; and pierce the two ends of the skin with the two ends of the siphac, which is beneath the skin inside, until you make it pierce from that part, and bring together the two ends of the siphac, all four together;
then strain it with a double thread around the needle from both sides, then bring together the two ends of the wound properly, and then leave a finger's width of space, and stick another needle in it;
then tie it with thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to your need for needles, until the entire wound is restrained;
and let the needles be medium, between thin and thick, for thin needles cut all the flesh, and the too thick ones cannot enter well: for this reason they must be medium;
and one must not push the needles too far outside of the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before it heals;
and then cut the ends of the needles, so they do not hurt the patient during sleep, and put tents or small cloths at the ends of the needles to hold better, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this manner of suturing with needles is most suitable for small wounds, for one needle or two suffices there.
The second suture is common, and it is that you bring together the two ends of the skin and the two ends of the siphac together with a needle that has a strong medium thread;
and when you have pierced these four ends together, bring back the needle to the part where you began, in the manner that one sews clothes;
and put between each suture the width of a little finger;
this suture men know, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, who was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm's width in size, and intestines came out well two palms' width in size, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been outside for 24 hours, and the wound was healed within 15 days, and I treated him, and he was cured.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and it was a miracle;
and I did not treat it with ointment, for I was in a place where none could be found, nor any medicines; and I put nothing but old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper manners of suturing:
take the needle, and push it from the outside part to the inside;
when it has pierced the skin straight through, leave the end of the siphac on the side where you pushed the needle, and make it pierce from the other part from the inside to the outside;
and the understanding of this suture is that you sew as the furriers do the skins, and that you leave the siphac once on one side, and take it up again from the other, until the suture is completely finished.
The second manner of suture, which Galen specifically mentions, is as some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the syfac to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the end of the mirach nearby, and pierce that place only, and leave the two ends of the syfac; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside part to the inside, at the two ends of the syfac;
then pierce one and the other from the outside part to the inside, at two other ends of the mirach that are on the other side;
and this is the best manner of suture and the most common.
Galen speaks these words, and some testify to it, that one should sew the belly with two needles, with thread in each;
and one should push one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the suture is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the air has changed it, put back the intestine, and sew it;
then put on the powder generating flesh, and if the air has changed it, put on some ointment that is present, until the wound suppurates; and the threads fall out, and the sifac and the mirach are sealed; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you don't have medicines, put on, as soon as it starts to discharge pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you have no need of other medicine in many conditions when the wounds are simple;
and if you fear that the wound might communicate with the principal members, it is necessary that you moisten light wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and put it around the groins, and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or rot in the bowels, and this happens many times, then give him an enema of warm black wine, especially if the rot reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and its nature's proximity to nerves.
And if the omentum protrudes from the wound, put it back like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, it is necessary that you tie the place that is black, so that blood flow doesn't come there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut what is between the binding, and let the two hanging ends from the part below the wound hang outside to ease the extraction when the omentum falls and the wound suppurates.
On the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is broken, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and became old and turned into a fistula, and excrement and winds came out of it;
I treated it as best I could, and did not cease to refine until it was healed, and the place sealed.
And when I saw it seal, I feared that the patient might have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be tied in this manner: take ants with large heads, then bring together the lips of the wound, and when the ant has opened its mouth, put it on the two lips, so that it tightens its mouth on them;
and then cut off its head, and this holds so that it cannot come undone, then put another ant after in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely covered; and sew the wound.
These ends attach to the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread that is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
take the end of this intestinal thread that is well cleaned of flesh, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then push the thread into the needle, and sew the intestine, and bring it back to the rupture;
and this manner of ant-like stitching is only according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no skill or health in it, except subtlety.
of fistula wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it ages, is universally called "fistula," and especially when it is hollow and produces pus.
And fistula is in truth a hardened and white felt-like nodule, where one feels no pain, and it is hollow like a bird's feather;
and sometimes clear pus comes out, and other times thick; sometimes little, and other times much;
and I have already spoken in the division of wounds, that every wound that is not healed, and has no flesh, is only due to one of nine causes: that is to say, by the scarcity of blood in the body; or by its malice; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the lips, that doesn't let flesh grow; or there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good for the cure; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because of the property in the region, digestion is slow, and health is delayed, and swollen by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the medicinal cures in the division.
Now I must make known to you the cure of fistula that is done by hand operation.
Know that fistula occurs in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the great veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and there are such that come to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that doesn't come up to the place that I have said, and you have faith in the cure, and you want to know it, then take a probe of brass or iron, if the fistula is straight, probe it thus;
and if the fistula is twisted, probe it with a fine lead probe, for lead bends better around the tortuosity;
and if the fistula has many holes and you cannot probe it well with probes, then give it an enema through one of the holes, for the moisture runs from one hole to another, and cleanses it;
then probe it wisely to your ability, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and if it is hollow deep inside, and ask well of the patient about the pain they feel when you press with your hand, and the place where they feel it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it as I have told you, and remove the felt-like material and the corrupted flesh that are inside;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep straight down, then you must cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in probes moistened with sharp medicine, and push them to the head of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the superfluity that remains at the bottom;
and then put in ointments generating healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If no vein or nerve hinders you, or principal members, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, scrape it until all corruption is removed, then treat it with flesh-generating substances until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and produces pus as before, know that you have not gone deep enough:
so uncover and search until you reach the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it heals this way, that is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; so there is no other solution than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it with pincers, extract it with an instrument suitable for this, and if there are many bones, pull them all out, don't leave even one;
and if moisture hinders you, and there is no error or fear, cut both moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them in one hour, put on the wound something that generates rot, and leave it until the area around the bones is rotted, and then the bones will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, scrape only the corruption until all blackness is removed, then restore the wound;
and if there is a large portion of corruption, and it reaches to the marrow of the bone; then it must be sawed and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treat it until it is sealed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that occurred in a man's leg, so that you may take example and help in your work.
There was a young man around 30 years old, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, until the matter came to the leg, and it swelled with a large abscess, and had no external cause to open;
but the physicians in their folly worked on it until the abscess opened, and much matter ran out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared that all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians treated it for about 2 years, and there was no one skilled in the art of hands, until I was called, and saw his leg and the medicines with which they were treating it, and what was flowing from the holes in great quantity; and the young man's body became red, and had a citrine color.
I inserted a probe into one of these holes, and then examined all the holes, and found that they connected with each other from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted and pierced, and the corruption went to the bone within;
I sawed what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought there was no other corruption, except what I removed;
and I began to restore the wound with sealing medicines for a long time, and it could not seal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued in the bone, and sawed it, and then removed it, and strove to seal the place; but I could not until I cut about a palm's length of the bone, and pulled it out with all its marrow, then restored it with medicines; and it was healed and sealed quickly, and there was no need to restart the work except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had for him. For due to the evacuation he often hiccupped, but he was healed entirely, and hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and he was of good disposition and had no harm or hindrance at all, neither in coming nor going.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it must be sawed in this manner: take a binding, and tie it at the head of the exposed bone, and command someone to pull it upward; and put another binding of wool thicker than the first binding, and tie it above the flesh that is over the bone, and extend the head, so that you pull the corrupted flesh below, and uncover the flesh above the place where you want to saw, so that the sawing does not injure the flesh;
and put a board or a plank under the bone to better cut the corrupted flesh;
and one must saw as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and saw again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and not visible, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then put a board underneath, and then saw from one part to the other the corruption, and let the sawing be a little longer than the corruption, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it continues on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other device than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, this thing is very difficult, but nevertheless you must investigate this corrosion, how it appears to you; and clean it in all the ways that you can, but make sure that the vein or the nerve do not oppose you;
and know that the cutting tools and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and their fineness, and their size and their smallness, and their hardness; and for this reason it is necessary to prepare for each type of operation its instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument that you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the types of diseases; so consider the instrument that you need according to what is required.
Heads rot either from internal causes, or from external causes;
and when you will have treated this corrosion with the cure of medicines, and they do not help, then it is necessary to cut that limb up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes by this from death, or from the greater evil of the loss of the limb;
and the sign is that the limb becomes black, so that it seems that it has been burned by fire, and rots after the blackening, then this corrosion goes from limb to limb, and takes over the whole body;
so hasten to cut, and if it is by the strike of some venomous beasts, such as sea scorpion and viper and similar, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, then cut it, and do not give it space to come to the hand.
And if it comes to the hand, then cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not come to the arm;
and if it comes to the arm, then cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, that is death, and no administration helps except the quantity of its strength;
and do exactly the same when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, then cut it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, then cut the whole foot; and if it rises to the leg, then cut at the joint of the knee;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other device than to leave the patient to death;
and the manner of cutting or sawing the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant extends one of the bindings downward, and another assistant the other binding upward, and you separate the flesh that is between the two bindings with a wide spatula, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or saw it, and put on each side a linen cloth, so that the saw does not touch the healthy place, and cause the patient another injury and hot abscess.
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some styptic powders;
then return to your medicine until it is completed, then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you what happened to a man in his foot:
he developed a blackness that looked like a burn from fire, and this corrosion first came in his toe, until it spread throughout the foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off the foot, and was healed;
and long time after the corrosion returned in his finger, and he came to me, and I applied repercussive things after purifying the body, and the corrosion could not be stopped;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, as I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also feared that if I cut his hand, he might die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have only told this so that others might do the same, if they have need.
Sometimes an abscess comes in a fleshy place, and remains so long that it makes a great collection of pus; and then breaks and pierces, and the pus leaks out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin above is as thin as a fine cloth, and does not corrupt down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such illness is called a "sinus," and is not called a "fistula";
but if it is so extended that it reaches down to the bone in depth, then it is called a "fistula";
and the treatment is that you cut this skin all around, especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not adhere due to its corruption.
And if you trust that the skin will adhere, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with a clyster thus:
observe if the sinus is large, and the pus that comes out has a foul odor, then cleanse it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put to cook in a vessel over fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and melt it in water and honey, and cleanse the sinus with it, and constrict the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then draw it out by squeezing;
do this many times, until the sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed;
and sometimes it is cleansed with ash-water, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over it, then strain it, and cleanse with it, until you know that the sinus is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot bear it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash-water, then cleanse it with water and honey in which there is a little ground litharge; or cleanse it with honey and mixed wine, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine makes the sinus adhere;
and when you have done this, and you trust that the sinus is well cleansed, then cleanse it with that which makes flesh grow in it, and it is that you take diaphoenicon plaster, and melt it with rose oil and wine;
or cleanse it with some medicines and ointments, of which I have spoken of the properties in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the sinus is small, and the tube of the clyster cannot enter, then enlarge it a little with an iron, and put in a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged;
and if the wound is too wide, then sew it and leave only one place where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is above, cut it at the lowest point that there is.
and if you cannot cut the breast below as you wish, then prepare it in such a way that the pus flows to the lowest point there is, for when the pus is deep, it doesn't allow flesh to generate and if you cannot cut the breast below as you wish, then prepare it in this way: so that the pus flows easily downward, and leave none of the pus;
so that the pus flows easily downward, and leave none of the pus; and take consolidative medicines to put on the breast, and spread on it a linen cloth that covers the whole breast; then cut with scissors around the hole in the breast a little wider than before, then spread gentle ointment on another cloth according to the size of the hole, and put it on the hole of the breast to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days once;
and the one that is on the hole of the breast, remove often to remove the pus, and know what will flow of the pus, if it is poison or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take note if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is swelling or not, and when your medicine is spread in such a way and you see the nature that emerges on the hole of the breast, know that the breast is already healing, and health approaches;
and then unbind it in the morning, or the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle poison flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health approaches.
For there are men whose flesh generation in their wounds is slow, and those who do the contrary;
and if undigested pus emerges from the breast after many days, know that the breast is not healing;
and if the breast is slow to heal, and is prolonged, then add drying medicines moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as diafinicon ointment, for it has a great part of vitriol, and this is the last medicine;
take diafinicon ointment, and melt it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with old wine equal in substance;
then prepare it and use it;
and this same thing works better cooked thickened, when diafinicon ointment is not present, or take myrrh and aloe and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey when it is on the fire;
and then glue a cloth, and spread it on the breast, and sometimes one administers long aristolochia, and roots of celestial lily, which is like vetch flour and centaury; and use them simple or compound: grind them, and make powder, and put on the honey that I mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression in the bone, or in hard members, or in ligaments; then treat it with the treatment of fistula, as we have said before.
Whitlow is a swelling that grows under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or of the foot, or perhaps grows in other fingers;
and when it is old, and one does not take care of it, then comes a hot swelling, and corrupts and discharges pus until it corrupts the root of the nail, and perhaps corrupts it all;
and the corruption comes to the bone, until there comes a foul pain, and the head of the finger is wide, and the color is dark.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not profit, then it is necessary that you cut with an iron all the superfluity that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound after. The cautery is very great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses the flesh in, and begins to prick it, and wounds it, then it is necessary that you put the probe under the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and put on the remainder of the flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove all; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corrosion is in the bone, cut it and pull it out, for as long as the corrupted bone remains there, it cannot heal;
And if you see the finger corrupting, cut it at one of the joints as mentioned before, then treat it until it heals;
And if it is struck and pushed, and there is great pain, you must first bleed it;
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula crosswise from above, and be careful that the cut doesn't reach the flesh under the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
And if it happens, put something on it that soothes.
The extra finger that grows on some men's hands by chance is sometimes all flesh, and sometimes has bones, and sometimes has a nail, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or the growth is at some knuckle of the fingers.
The one that grows at some knuckle of the finger doesn't move, and the one that grows at the joint of the finger might move;
The cutting of the one that is fleshy is easy, in this manner: Cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
The one that grows at the root of the joint is difficult to treat: So refrain from cutting it.
For the one that grows on the finger at the last knuckle, you must first cut the flesh in a circle down to the bone, then cut the bone with a saw suitable for this, then treat it until it heals.
The fusion that comes to fingers together comes by birth, or by healing of a wound, or by burning of fire, or by similar things.
So you must cut this fusion, so that the fingers return to their natural forms; Then put between them pledgets or cloths soaked in rose oil, so they don't fuse together; Or put between them thin pieces of lead, until the area has healed as it should.
If fusion comes to any of these fingers with the palm, cut that fusion as needed.
Varicose veins are large veins wrapped up full of melancholic superfluities, that come in several members of the body;
And it happens more in legs of those who walk on foot and who work and carry, than to others.
It is necessary then that you sometimes administer purging of bile, and then bleed them from the basilic vein.
The iron treatment is according to two methods: One is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; And the other method is that you lift the vein, and pull it all out.
The cutting is according to this method: First sprinkle the leg with very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then tighten the patient's leg from above the thigh to the part below the knee;
Then cut the vein in one place, or in two or three, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear;
And then bind it, and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile;
And restart the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The removal of it is according to this manner: Shave the patient's leg, if there is much hair, then put it in the bath, and sprinkle the leg with hot water until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you don't have a bath, then heat it by the fire, and then cut along the vein lengthwise at the top of the knee, or in the part below at the ankle;
then open the skin with the hook, and strip the vein from each side, until it appears when one feels it;
and one sees it red and black, and when it enters the skin it appears like a white cord;
then push the probe underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then hang it on the small hook, then cut it in another place three fingers away;
then strip the skin above the vein until it appears, then lift it with the probe, as you have done, and hang it on another hook, as you did first;
then make another cut, or several if you need them, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it up to the second cut;
then pull it from cut to cut, until it all comes out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then push a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and push a probe underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and be careful that it doesn't break, because if it breaks, one cannot pull or lift it, and harm comes to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, put wool soaked in wine and rose oil on the wound site; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vessel is contracted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must cut it in a twisted manner, but do not cut it completely; and pull it as we have said before.
The form of the iron with which one cuts the vessel is curved, and does not slice, so that it doesn't cut the vein;
and it has a thick curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is its form:
This vein is generated in legs, in hot regions where neither herbs nor trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture;
and by chance it grows elsewhere than in legs, and this happens from the corruption that comes under the skin, just as serpents and worms come inside the body, generated between skin and flesh.
And the signs of the beginning of this vein are that there comes in the leg a very great inflammation, then the place changes, and the vein begins to come out, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead from one and a half drachms to two drachms, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg, and every time any comes out, wrap it around the lead, and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it has all come out; because if you cut it, it goes back into the flesh, and causes abscess and corruption in the place, and bad disease;
for which reason it must be drawn out little by little until the end, and nothing should remain in the body;
and sometimes this vein when it is drawn out is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it came out ten palms long, and when you cut it, push a probe into the hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out;
and let the matter which is inside be emptied, and administer to the place medicines generating corruption for some days, then treat it as with abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has fewer branches, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many holes come there, from which branches jump out;
treat it then as we have said before.
about worms that grow between skin and flesh This illness is called in our land "cattle disease," because it often happens to cattle, and it is a small worm that grows between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body climbing up and down, and one can feel it well as it moves from limb to limb, until it breaks through the skin where it goes, and jumps out;
and it is generated from the rotting of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and earthworms and roundworms come in the belly;
and one fears its malice, for when it travels through the body, and it rises to the head, and comes to the eye, by chance enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you want to cure it and extract it, one can only do so when it moves:
therefore you must tie the place above and below with a strong binding very tightly, then cut above and pull it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it, then cauterize it with fire above, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does is that it corrupts the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, strongly tighten below it the eyebrow, then cut above, and pull it out;
and the patient must use purification of the body with purgative medicines for the bad rotted humors, and should avoid foods that generate rot.
about the pain that comes from windiness This illness is called in our land "vakirir," and it is a pain that comes in certain limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and a little after, I saw it climb like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from place to place;
the pain left that place, and fixed itself in the shoulder, and then a little after ran throughout the body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it always turned around the body, just as I saw it.
I marveled greatly how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness according to this manner. Nevertheless, I had seen many who had indeed seen pain move from place to place, but I had not seen it, as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and exposed veins, and therefore this constrained windiness appeared;
and they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate, and who have moist bodies and hidden veins.
And when you want to cure this illness, and the patient feels that pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then bind it above and below hastily, and then cut above until this windiness constrained to the place comes out; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with that which expels windiness, such as fetid pills, and pills of sagapenum, and other similar things.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they fall.
Their diversity is such that there are those which have large points, and small ones, and hollow ones, and soldered ones; and those that have two angles, and those that have tongues, and those that have pieces;
and that which falls in any member falls according to two manners: or in principal hollow member, such as brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it falls therefore in any place of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you hereafter, appear to you: then you must beware of extracting this arrow, for death comes after in several dispositions; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deep, then pull it out, and cure the wound.
The signs when an arrow strikes the brain and pierces the bone, and the meninges which cover the brain protrude, are dizziness and headache and vertigo and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils or ears; and perhaps the person loses speech and voice; and from the wound comes white moisture resembling pus, and something like meat broth comes out;
and if these signs appear to you, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs when an arrow strikes the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were fixed in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like a pulse, and black blood flows from it, and coldness and cold sweat come, and fainting: know then without doubt that death approaches.
And the signs of an arrow that wounds the lung are that blood full of foam comes from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and breathes heavily and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the chest, it is beside the small ribs; and causes heavy breathing and great pain and sighing; and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and any feces comes out through the torn intestine, there is no hope in the treatment, nor in extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine comes out and flows outside, and the patient feels strong pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other members, such as the face and the neck and the throat and the shoulder and the upper arm and the spine of the back and the chest and the thigh and the legs, and similar members, can be saved according to various conditions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not poisoned, I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and drew it out on the other side below the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I drew out from a young man an arrow that had struck him in the fat of the eye below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was hidden, and I could only reach the point near the shaft, and it was a large arrow from a Turkish bow, with a light head without barbs;
the young man was healed, and no bad accidents befell him.
And I drew an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and it was an Arabic arrow with barbs:
I sawed off the barbs, and worked carefully until I drew it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I drew an arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly, and I thought he would die;
and after thirty days had passed, his condition had not changed; I cut above the arrow, and worked skillfully, and drew it out, and there were no bad consequences.
And I saw a man who was struck by an arrow in the back, and the wound healed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and his natural functions did not change, nor did he find any harm in any of his natural works.
And I saw another man, who was struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound healed; and he remained thus without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And I drew an arrow from one of the king's princes, which had struck him in the middle of the nose, and was slightly declining to the right side; and the arrow was completely hidden.
I was called to treat it three days after it had fallen. So I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a fine probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a pricking and pain below his right ear.
I thought it was from the point of the arrow. I put on the place an attractive and digestive plaster, so that the place would not swell; and the location of the arrow became apparent to me.
and the location of the arrow became apparent to me. I applied the plaster for many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus for a long time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose;
and he told me about it. I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days, until it was opened, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow which was stuck in place;
then I added more of this sharp medicine to the wound opening, until the head of the arrow became visible to me;
and about 4 months passed, and then I enlarged the wound so that I could insert the forceps, and moved it from one side to the other, but it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise types of instruments, until one day I grabbed it with well-made forceps, according to the form that will appear at the end of this chapter, until I pulled it out, and restored the wound.
And the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was sealed, and the patient was healed entirely.
Now I have told you the quality of extraction of some arrows, so that you may focus your care on what I have not said, for the book cannot contain everything;
but the wise master compares upon little great things, and upon what is present and missing, finds new work, and new instruments, for the removal of strange things that occur in this art.
I say that arrows exit from the members where they are lodged only in 2 ways: either through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and that which exits through where it entered, is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes exits immediately.
And if it does not exit immediately, leave it until the flesh around it is rotted, and the exit is eased;
and also if it is lodged in the bone, and cannot exit, leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it exits, and if it does not exit, pierce around it with a fine drill, until the area around is enlarged, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is hidden in a place of the body so that one cannot see it, seek it with a probe; and if you feel it, pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the narrowness of the wound, and because of the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone or nerve or vein, then split it until the wound is large;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if there are barbs on the arrow by which it holds, remove the flesh that is lodged in it from both sides as best you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful not to break the arrow, as you would pull it out more painfully.
And if you cannot do it at once, leave it until the area around is rotted, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we have said about the treatment in its chapter;
and guard yourself from cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can best pull out the arrow without danger, either quickly or slowly, either firmly or gently;
and position the patient according to the position he was in when the arrow fell in, for this is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then position him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes out through another part, either some part of it appears, or the skin is swollen right there so that one can see or feel it clearly:
then cut above it, until the forceps can grasp it, and then extract it: it will come out immediately.
And if it is stuck in the bone, rotate your hand in a circular motion, until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it there still, and then restart the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, push it out with the shaft;
and if the shaft falls off, and you want to administer pushing, use a hollowed instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the hollow of the instrument;
and then push outward, and if the arrow is hollow, push in a pointed instrument to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as needed.
And if the arrow falls into the chest or the belly or the bladder or the side, and it is near, and you can cut above it, then cut;
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pincers used to extract arrows resembles a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many types: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the hollow pusher is like a bird's feather, for pushing at the point of the arrow, as shown here in this shape:
The veins from which one bleeds are 31, of which 16 are in the head, namely: Two pulsing ones that are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries that are visible in the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two jugulars that are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the upper lips of the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins commonly used for bleeding are 5 in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and it is on the left side, and lay people call it the "head vein"; and the middle one is called "faste," and is composed of the cephalic and basilic, and lay people call it the "heart vein"; and the basilic is on the right side, and lay people call it the "belly vein," and it is above the forearm, and it is the one from which one bleeds, which appears clearly above the thumb.
And the salvatella is the vein that is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is below the curve of the thumb on the left side, and the second saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein that is called "nesse," which is in the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg there are three veins below these.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with old catarrhs and migraine;
and the quality of bleeding, as I tell you, is that you shave the patient's head, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient should tighten their neck with a vise, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places descending from the head: search for them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed there with ink;
then take the lancet, and push it under the vein up to the bone, then lift your hand with the vein upward, and cut both the skin and the vein a good two fingers across, and let out as much blood as you want;
then compress and bind it until it is healed;
and I have already described the incision and cauterization in the first book.
The bleeding of the two arteries that are in the temples helps with chronic migraine, and headache, and recurring eye inflammation, and with the flow of sharp tears in the eyes;
and the method of bleeding is as I say: and it is that the patient tightens their neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then mark with ink;
then lift the vein up high with your index finger, and push the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward, and cut it, as you have done with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then untie the patient, and put your finger on the vein for an hour, then put cotton on it; and then bind it firmly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken about their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
The bleeding of the forehead vein helps as much as the bleeding of the cephalic vein for chronic facial ailments, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the method is that the patient tightens their neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument that is called "digger," of which here is the form:
And put the point on the vein, and strike upon it with your hand, or with something else, and let the blood flow according to the quantity that you want; then untie the patient's neck, and bind the vein until it is healed, and sometimes one opens it with a wide fleam.
However, the fleam should not be too sharp; and bleed it crosswise, because the bone is near, and by chance the fleam breaks when it is thin.
The bleeding of the two veins that are in the tear ducts helps with eye problems, and with ringworm, and with redness, and with styes in the eye, and with facial diseases;
and the method of their bleeding is that the patient tightens their neck by twisting with some binding, as before;
then bleed it, and let the bleeding be crosswise, a bit along the length with a somewhat wide fleam, because there is no flesh there. And if the fleam is thin, it might break by chance;
then let the blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind cotton on it, and bind it well.
The bleeding of the nose vein helps with acute conditions, and with violent headache, and with facial diseases, such as migraine and redness that comes to the face, and especially when it is chronic;
and the method of bleeding is that the patient tightens their neck, then squeeze their nose with your left hand, and take the thin long fleam, and stick it in the middle of the lip in the space between the two nostrils, because the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will begin to flow immediately;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then bind it for a night, because it heals very quickly;
The bleeding of the two jugular veins helps with shortness of breath, and with the beginning of leprosy, and with many diseases, and with impetigo, and with corrosive conditions, and with herpes, and gangrene;
and the method of bleeding is that the patient tightens their neck below both of them, as we have said;
and let the master stand at the head of the patient, and let the patient sit on a seat, then bleed the vein lengthwise somewhat widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as needed;
then do the same to the other vein, then untie the binding, and compress both veins moderately, so that the patient doesn't strangle; and leave it until morning, until the wound is healed.
On bleeding the lips Bleeding the veins of the upper lips helps with flow in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and cracks of the lips, and of the nose and around it.
And the method of bleeding is to have the patient sit before you, and tighten their neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is on the right lip and the other on the left, and one recognizes them because they are black, and because around them are small black veins:
cut therefore one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and do the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
On bleeding under the tongue Bleeding the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding the cephalic vein, and this is for tightness of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the method of bleeding is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun, and lift their tongue, and look underneath on each side for a black vein:
bleed therefore one and the other, and do not go too deep, for below are the arteries.
The veins of the elbow from which one commonly bleeds are bled according to two methods:
either by pricking with a wide myrtle-shaped fleam, or with a thin olive-shaped one like sharp knives, and it is called "anesil"; and they are wide or thin according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle fleam is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is needed for opening hollow veins full of thick visible blood, and that contain thick and troubled blood; and this is the form of the olive-shaped fleam:
and it is thinner and pointed, and is for bleeding thin veins, where there is thin citrine blood.
The bleeding of the basilic, which is one of these veins, helps with diseases that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is proper for the bleeder to bleed wisely, and to beware of the artery which is below. And if he cuts the artery, and blood flow comes, then he must stanch it, as I have said; and the fleam must not be pricking, but cutting like an anesil.
And if the basilic does not appear clearly, then you must tighten it, and change to another; or you seek some branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut it with the anesil fleam, as we have said.
And if you want to know the place of bleeding, it is proper before you tighten the arm, that you touch the place until you recognize the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the anesil fleam; and beware that you do not strike the artery when you see the place swollen, for that is from the artery: avoid it therefore.
And if you see jumping high like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: hurry therefore, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stanches, which happens many times; then tie the arm, and leave it thus, and let not the patient move it;
and let him be under fear, and not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stanched, and it overcomes you, and the medicine is not present, then cut the artery if it appears, for its ends will retract; and the blood stanches.
And take a shell of pistachio, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it well until the next day;
if the blood stanches, that is good; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stanch blood;
and the stanching is not difficult in several conditions because of the small place of the wound, and the power of the arm binding.
Bloodletting from the middle vein helps as it draws blood from the head above, and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
The bloodletter must beware of the nerve that lies below, and if he punctures too deeply and finds the nerve, it swells and health becomes grave, and perhaps cannot be healed;
And this nerve appears very often, and if it doesn't appear in some men due to its subtlety, then you must bleed them with the lance instrument; And avoid the nerve to the best of your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then split it lengthwise.
Bloodletting from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
And one must bleed by puncturing with an olive-shaped lancet or myrtle-shaped lancet, for it is the safest of all veins, as there is neither nerve nor artery below it. Nevertheless, one must seek the easiest place, and it does no harm if one fails the first time and begins again; And perhaps the place swells in some men when one fails the first time, but it does no harm.
The quality of the bloodletting is according to your judgment.
The first thing you must know about bloodletting is that it is only administered to maintain health and to avoid future illnesses;
And the bloodletting should be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow: That is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; And one should bleed at the beginning of spring while fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear;
And one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
Bloodletting that is administered for illnesses has no fixed time, but rather whenever needed day or night, at all hours and in all seasons;
And one must not bleed children until fourteen years, nor pregnant women except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner, they should purify their intestines with a light clyster if they have retained much waste, so that the veins don't draw from the intestines the rotten superfluities harmful to the principal members;
Neither should one bleed someone who is too full of food, nor who is drunk until they are out of it, nor those with dropsy;
And one should beware of bleeding after colic passion, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse with women, and from work, staying awake and fasting, and that which takes all strength, whether from the soul or the body;
Then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, through foods and drinks and medicines, if you have the ability;
Then enter the bath, if nothing forbids it, to thin the blood, and bleed yourself from the chest vein around the third hour, as we have said;
And guard yourself that day from work, and from effort, and from lust, and from similar things;
And be happy and joyful, and let the bloodletter be higher than the one being bled, and rub their arm two or three times, then tighten the band above moderately, for when it is too tight or loose, the blood cannot flow;
And then rub the place with hands until the veins swell and can be felt;
Then the bloodletter should moisten the lancet with a little old oil, then put his finger of his left hand on that vein a bit below the place where he wants to bleed, so that the vein doesn't flee and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like cords when bled, and there are some that are full of windiness, so that when one puts the lancet on them, the lancet retracts, and cannot open the vein, and thus it is with these; And if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bloodletter must be aware of these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; If not, then begin again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the area is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it for 1 or 2 days, and do not bind the arm: perhaps a hot abscess will come;
do not enter the bath, then restart the bloodletting if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or if the blood flows thinly and you doubt that as much blood will come out as you want, strike in that same opening with the lancet directly;
and work a bit hastily, before the area becomes swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the area swollen, do not restart the bloodletting, and put on a little oil lees, for it relieves the body of blood, and the lees are better in this place than the oil;
and thus administer the oil lees in each bloodletting where you bleed the veins, to staunch the flow of blood;
and theriac and egg white do the same thing, when one puts it on the place; it thins the blood and disperses it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess comes, which happens many times, especially when it is bled only that one time or the opening of the vein is small, hurry, and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and salt a little hot, and bind it for an hour;
and you should do this after the blood flows from the vein, and if there remains in the place after some days some blackness or greenness, it does not harm; and if you wish, put on some aloes or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, wild mint, or similar.
And many times abscess and swelling happen at the bloodletting of the basilic vein:
put therefore your hand on it, and if you find the place soft when pressing with the hand, this swelling is bad. Avoid then putting on any of the things we have mentioned, for perhaps blood from the artery flows from it;
but make a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with other treatment, until it is healed.
And draw from each person blood according to the quantity of their strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it becomes red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is fitting for one who is full and strong, and needs blood drawn, that one make a larger wound, and let the lancet be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and it is fitting to bleed little and often, and one should bleed by cutting across, not by piercing;
and this manner of bloodletting is safe from blood running and nerve cutting, and is worth more than bleeding lengthwise or widely.
And to one whose body fails during bloodletting, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is heated, draw blood 3 or 4 times. And if he is of cold complexion, let him eat before bloodletting bread soaked in musk syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bloodletting, after the release of much blood, it is fitting that he sip meat broth, and subtle aromatic syrup, and use the other things that we have mentioned in the division or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of veins.
And if he wants to air his arm, and bleed another time, it is fitting, when he is weakened by great bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And who wants to air his arm after the first bloodletting, and he has a strong body, should bleed 7 hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And who wants to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second day or the third.
For there is much blood inside the body which is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a great quantity, and enlarge the hole until they fall into a faint; once you observe all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on their pulse while they bleed, so that death does not come in place of fainting, which happens many times when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not necessary when you want to untie the arm and make blood flow a second time, and the hole is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if it is bent, that they extend the arm hastily, for this would be bad;
but let it bleed the second time; or you prick it with the point of the lancet, until the blood that is congealed at the hole of the vein comes out, and put on a little salt mixed with water, and press lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it until the swelling has subsided.
And if there is necessity to draw blood a second time, bleed them in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the head vein because it is compound.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts their hand in hot water until the forearm becomes red;
then it should be tied moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not widely nor lengthwise;
and let the hole be wide, and let it be bled very close to the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in hot water, and let the blood flow in the water until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in hot water, for one uses it more in winter than in summer;
and the bleeding of this vein is safer than all other veins, as there is neither artery nor nerve.
The bleeding of the salvatel vein of the right hand is valuable for all diseases of the liver, and this is the manner:
squeeze the hand, and put it in hot water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and bleed it across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves beneath are completely bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in hot water if the blood is congealed in the wound and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and salt on the vein to seal it quickly, and do this for each branch.
The bleeding of it in the left hand is valuable for disease of the spleen, and do exactly as I told you for the right.
The bleeding of the saphenous vein is valuable for all diseases that are below the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menses, and disease of the kidneys, and of old [conditions of the] thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
And the quality of its bleeding is that the patient puts their foot in hot water, and rubs above the vein until it appears, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot go many branches;
bleed it then in the largest branch, or at the ankle, which is better.
And if you bleed it above the foot, beware of the nerves that are beneath, and bleed it across as if cutting;
and let the lancet be angled.
And if the blood cannot come out, put the foot back in the water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeder fails the first time, begin again a little above, for the place is safe;
do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and its bleeding is valuable for pain in the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is such that the patient enters the bath, and tightens above the ankle 4 fingers while twisting, for otherwise the vein doesn't appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in all the ways that you can, and crosswise; and it's better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very hidden from many men.
and it's better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very hidden from many men. And if you don't find it, then bleed some branch of it that appears on the top of the foot, and towards the little toe, and guard yourself from the nerves;
and let as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the binding, and put cotton on it and tighten; it is now healed.
Cups are made of horns, or brass, or glass;
and cupping is done according to 2 methods: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping which is without striking is according to 2 methods: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and cupping which is done by striking and by extraction of blood is done in 14 places of the body, of which one is at the very top of the head; and the other is in the middle of the neck; and 2 others on the 2 sides of the neck; and the cup under the chin; and the cup of the 2 shoulders; and the cup on the haunches; and the cups in the middle of the 2 arms; and the cups of the 2 legs; and the cups of the 2 ankles;
and cupping doesn't draw blood, except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and because of this one doesn't weaken, as one does from bleeding a vein; and it should not be administered, neither with fire nor without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illnesses cupping is needed, or by custom, we administer it each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle and at all times;
for there are those who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are those who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and those who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are those who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it's in the middle of the month, we command them to be cupped after 3 hours of the day.
The bleeding of the snout helps with the heaviness of the head ... that comes to the eyes, and it should not be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bleeding the cephalic vein, and those who are of cold complexion should not use it, or who have catarrh, for it does them much great harm;
and because of this the elderly should not use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And those who bleed themselves often become forgetful, and because of this one should put the cup a little lower for fear of forgetfulness.
The cupping in the middle of the neck is in place of bleeding the head and the basilic vein, and because of this it helps with tightness of the chest, and splitting of the lung channel, and coughing, and repletion;
and it should be pushed little, for if it holds too firmly, it engenders forgetfulness in the stomach and heart.
The cuppings on the 2 sides of the neck help with head pains, and ophthalmia and migraine, and strangulation, and pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bleeding the basilic vein;
and you should command the bleeder that he press his hand when placing it, that he not cut the artery, and bleeding doesn't occur.
The cuppings under the chin help with mouth disease, and corruption of gums, and similar illnesses that are in the mouth; and is in place of bleeding the two lips.
The cuppings of the shoulders help with illness that comes from heat and from repletion.
Cupping on the elbows is worth as much as [bleeding from] the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins;
and instruct the bleeder not to strike too deeply, for the place is bare of flesh, and there are nerves and arteries below.
The cup that is placed on the buttocks is effective for hemorrhoids of the fundament and for illnesses below, and the cup should be large and made of brass, as it needs to draw well; and if by chance it were thin, it would break; and make large incisions there.
The cups on the legs bleed openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the kidneys, of the womb, and of the bladder, and bring back menstrual flow;
and they substitute for [bleeding from] the two saphenous veins and the two ankles, and nevertheless they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in several conditions.
The method of applying the cup is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease doing this until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of blood appears;
then strike, and replace the cups, and take care regarding the condition of bodies, for there are those who have tender flesh and clear pores: for these it is necessary to strike only once, and to make wide wounds, and a little deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to thin the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we want to draw blood little by little, once suffices for us. And if we want much blood, we begin again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the end point is that the skin should be suddenly pierced, and it is necessary for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cups with aperitive and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seeds;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then take amaranth oil, or costmary oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
And if the one being bled has tender flesh and wide pores, it is not necessary to apply any oil, but it is necessary to wash after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or pumpkin water, or purslane water, or similar.
And those who have much moisture should wash with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities should wash with old wine, or elder water, or decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not cup before the bath nor in the bath, but after the bath one hour or two;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that one protect oneself, when one must be cupped and when one has been cupped.
And observe if the one being bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then it is necessary that they take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat chickens, and mutton, and moist foods.
and eat chickens, and mutton, and moist foods. And those who have a cold complexion should take honey syrup, and fragrant wine of medium age, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day that one is cupped, one should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give to some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before cupping, or after, to strengthen the principal members; and the blood should be thinned, but those who are hot should not drink it.
The cupping glasses that are applied without cutting are those placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and for gout, and on the belly and the navel and the kidneys and the hip, for these members cannot bear cutting upon them, and it is only done to draw blood from member to member, as we place them on the breasts when the nose bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the member, as we place cupping glasses on the belly and on the navel to reduce the member;
and it removes the pain, when there is blockage or stone, it removes through its attractive power perhaps the blockage, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and thus it does when one places it on the liver and on the spleen when there is retained windiness, and these cupping glasses are administered empty for suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire, and sometimes full of tepid water, as in diseases of pleurisy, and in such manner that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been cooked for this purpose.
The form of the cupping glass administered with fire is thus:
And it should be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have on the side around the middle a small hole, as if to insert a needle, and be made of brass, smooth in front so that it doesn't hurt the patient when placed on the member;
and have in the middle a crossbar of brass or iron, to place a lit candle, and there should be both large and small ones according to the diseases and the age of those who receive them;
for the cupping glasses of children are different from those of the elderly, and those for the thin different from those for the fat.
And one should place this cupping glass on the member thus:
light the wax candle or a wick, and place it in the middle of the cupping glass across the bar that is in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping glass so it doesn't burn the patient;
and then place it on the member, and your finger should be on the hole that we mentioned, so that when desired, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one lights the wick as before, and begins again often, if you have need.
In the cupping glass then that is administered in disease of pleurisy, with water, there is no bar nor hole, and it is only administered when it is full of water, and is placed on the member only;
and this is the form:
Leeches are only administered in members where one cannot place cupping glasses due to their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and other similar places;
and the quality of use is that when you find leeches that are in clean fresh waters without rot, take them;
and put them one night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then bleeding should be done from vein and cupping glass, then rub the member until it is red, and place the leeches on it;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can place a cupping glass, place it, for this is very beneficial afterward.
If not, then wash the place with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then squeeze it;
and if the place bleeds too much after the removal of the leeches, moisten a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on until the blood is stanched;
and if the blood is multiplied, place ground vitriol on it, or galls, and similar things, until it is stanched;
or you place on the spot halved peeled beans, and leave them until they stick to the place, thus it will stanch immediately;
and if you have more need of them, take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to attach, rub the place with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood comes out, and then place them on, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you want them to fall off, sprinkle on a little ground alum and salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and concerns the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish physicians avoid this chapter, for they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read their letters;
and for this reason science is foreign in our land, for I never found any good ones;
and I know nothing of it, except through the science of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn forth the science, and through experiment, and through the customs of my life;
and I have already described to you in this chapter what is contained, and have abbreviated it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of instruments that are administered, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is therefore necessary that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the speech and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are proven may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when fracture or dislocation or torsion or bruising comes to someone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, unless something prevents you, such as weakness of body, or child, or elderly; or if the weather is very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold things, that is to say cold soups, and bird meat and kid meat, and drink no wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and not fill oneself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you have no fear of hot abscess, nor of spreading of matter to the limb;
then let the patient return to his first regimen that he was used to.
And when the broken bone begins to restore, it is necessary that one nourishes the patient with foods that make thick nourishment, where there is viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow belly, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment the fracture heals better and faster.
And know that the broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot well heal nor solder according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor those also who are too tender, such as bones of small children;
but no matter, bring back upon the broken bone a thick cartilage that adheres and joins the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not prevent it from its work, and for this reason it is necessary to nourish it with thick foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For the fracture of the head is different from the fracture of the chest, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all manner of fractures. For there is fracture that goes in an arch, and another in sharpening, like the cut of a quill for writing.
For there is fracture that goes in an arch, and another in sharpening, like the cut of a quill for writing. And there is fracture with wound, and fracture with just a small crack.
And each manner has its device, and its proper instrument in the restoration, according to what the memory comes in its place;
and the fracture of the bone is known by the fact that the place is twisted, and appears well from outside, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is neither twisting nor sound to the touch, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but there can well be twisting, or cracking, or small fracture. So it is not necessary that you move it by hand, but put on medicines that come hereafter, and then bind it now subtly.
And know that the fracture that goes in an arch, and the two parts are disjointed, it is necessary to set them straight immediately, before hot abscess comes there;
and if hot abscess comes there, leave it some days, until the abscess is calmed;
then set it straight as well as you can easily and wisely, and know that its restoration is easier than the restoration of that where there are pieces;
then bind it, as it is necessary hereafter.
And if there are broken pieces in the bone, stretch it from 2 sides, if it's hands or feet, or with your hand if it's a small limb, or with 2 ropes, or with one rope and your hand;
and put the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken limb are separated, bring back by all means the additions to their places as best as you can, and ensure that through your work no injury or pain comes to the patient;
and join well the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well set:
so straighten it gently, and don't tighten it too much, nor press as do those who through their work cause hot swelling and contraction of the limb, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is properly set, strongly warn the patient not to move it, neither while awake nor sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other way; and ensure well that the limb is so secured that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not properly set, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and ensure well that the limb is so secured that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not properly set, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and take care that it is placed straight, so that no twisting comes when it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in size and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar ones: so it is necessary to wrap them in soft and thin linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and hard bandage, for the wide bandage embraces all of the large limb, and tightens it equally from all sides, so that there is no mark;
then bind around light tow, 3 or 4 turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little with all the bandage, then go above the break and tighten less, so that the break then distances the break a little;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and turn around again over the broken area;
then go back to the part below the break, and tighten moderately, neither too strongly nor too softly, as we have said in the first binding above;
then put between the bandages linen tow or cloths, until it is all even, then bind over all with a band, and then put your well-made splints on top, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or abscess, put on something that soothes hot abscess, and that removes the swelling, and leave it thus for some days;
then tighten your splints, and let them be of half of a wide reed carefully scraped, or of wood from which one makes splits, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this shape:
but it is necessary that the splint that one puts on the break be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and be as long as is necessary for the limb whether small or large; then tighten over the splints as you did with the first binding, then bind over it a thread properly, as in the first binding over the break; tighter is away from it, always less;
and it is necessary that the threads be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bindings with cords of twisted linen, and this is a great error, for the binding cannot be even if it is too thin, and there must not be between each splint less than a finger's width of space.
And if the patient is wounded by the ends of the splints after the tightening in healthy places, put under them linen tow, or carded wool, so that he does not hurt himself.
When the wound is with the break, and the heart is broken, I will tell the treatment for it hereafter.
And know that it is not necessary to tighten with splints all broken limbs on the first day. When the limb is large, one should not put splints except after 5 or 7 days, or more according to your certainty about hot swelling occurring;
and here is the manner of ancient plasters for restoring breaks, dislocations, and sprains:
and it is that you take flour that sticks to the walls of the mill, and mix it with egg white, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common manner of the plaster restoring breaks in several conditions, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster restoring breaks and dislocations and sprains: take 3 measures of abareis and ladanum and elecampane and asafoetida and gum arabic and mugwort, equal parts of 10 measures; myrrh and aloe, equal parts of 5 measures; alechil 9 measures; and make powder of these, and mix them with egg white; if the man's complexion is hot, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and restores broken bones quickly, and is valuable to many men.
Another manner of plaster that is good for sprains: take mugwort and marshmallow, equal parts of 10 measures; myrrh and aloe, equal parts of 9 measures; acacia 6 measures; Armenian bole 10 measures, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply it.
Another manner of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and calms the occurring pain, and the cutting use of the bone, and the break: take new wool, and soak it in vinegar and in cooked oil, and put it on the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for calming hot swelling, and specifically removes the pains.
Another manner of plaster which restores broken bones: take dried fig leaves, and leaves of ground poppy, and grind together, and make a plaster.
Another manner of plaster for the restoration of bone breaks and for reducing the remainder of the swelling. Take marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, of each one part;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is heated, then mix it with water of fresh coriander, or with water, and use it.
Another manner of plaster stronger than the first, when hard swelling comes to the restoration of the limb. Take marshmallow roots, and linseed, pomegranate flower, melilot, and savory, and violet flowers and chamomile, of all equal parts one portion; and grind, and mix with willow water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should put nothing on the broken limb to restore it except cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else more, and says that it should be between neither too soft nor too hard.
And it seems to Galen that one should put on the broken limb, to restore it, dry things a little hot, such as myrrh and aloe and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another manner of plaster that is good for injury and pain: take mugwort and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and marshmallow, and salt equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it.
And then unbind it a little after, and check if the patient feels no pain, nor has the bone moved from its place; if not, do not unbind it for many days. And if pain comes to the place, or itching, without rest or swelling, then hasten, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take light cloth, and wet sea sponge, and plunge in water, and wash the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is calmed; then let the limb rest an hour, then put on dry wool, soaked in water or in rose oil, and bind it for a night, until you are sure about hot swelling;
and the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain is removed, then begin again the subtle binding, and a little plaster, and do not tighten it as strongly as before; and make it subtle until it is healed.
And if you see that hot abscess and redness and pain and swelling have already been completely removed, and you need a plaster and bandage, then start again, as you did first, evenly.
And if none of what we have mentioned comes to the limb, do not unwrap it except after 3 days or 4 or 5 or 7; and sometimes leave it for 20 days, according to what one sees, until the break adheres, and the joining of the flesh approaches above;
then tighten it more than before, and increase their food, as I said before;
and if you see the place drying more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot reach there; then sprinkle it with lukewarm hot water, every time you unwrap it, and this should be every third day, and loosen the bandage a little;
through this work therefore the nourishment runs to the limb, and quickly mends what foolish physicians do, who restore the limb crookedly:
this is bad, and it is dangerous work, and I see nothing else to do but to leave it and to work properly.
There are many types of fractures, and different shapes, and the causes are distinct;
for there are fractures that are made by the strike of a sword, and the blow removes all the bone down to the membrane which is beneath the bone, as does an axe or club; and for this reason this type of fracture is called "axe-cut."
Or the sword cuts the bone on top without piercing, and this type of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a dented percussion, or crack from blows of stone, or from falling on stone, or from other similar things.
And if there is a piercing fracture, which reaches to the membrane that is beneath the bone, or it is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And there is a wound that is hidden in the bone as thin as a hair, and the crack is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and there is the wound that is made either by striking with stone, or by falling, or by similar thing, and makes the piece of bone enter downward, and the place is hollowed as do the cauldron-makers when they strike upon the cauldrons; so the stone enters within.
And this happens more to those who have moist bones in the head, such as a child's head;
and it happens to all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated like splinters; and I will speak of this in its place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the examination upon them, and the investigation with probes, and by the corrupted flesh that is above.
The capillary appearance is known by this: when one has uncovered the bone, and one rubs ink upon it, the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptom, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of understanding, and tension, and fainting, and acute fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar things in several conditions, it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you see no frightening symptom, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded person first comes to you, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day at best as you can.
And if it is in summer, then hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane beneath the bone becomes corrupted, and the symptoms that we have mentioned come.
And if the bone fracture reaches the membrane that covers the brain, it is necessary that you split the broken part thus:
and it is that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover above the bone in all ways that you can, and above the shape of the wound as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs while uncovering the bone, or hot swelling, help it with what is necessary, and that is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot swelling has subsided, and you are assured there is no more bleeding; then begin around the bone to remove, and this is done according to two methods of operation:
one method is that you cut with the narrow cutting tool first, and this is the form:
And then insert another cutting tool larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different cutting tools, some narrow and others wide, and they should be pointed, and should be of Indian iron;
and work gently, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary that you pierce around it, before you apply cutting tools with drills, not so deep that they pierce through the skull bone, and there must be above the point a margin or a circle, which prevents the point from passing through the bone;
and you must have several of them, so that each comes to its place in the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all skulls;
and this is the form of the three types of drills:
The technique for drilling around the broken bone is that you put a drill on the bone, and turn with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the drill elsewhere a little after, and do so all around, then cut with incisors the space of bone that is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and gently, as we have said, until you extract the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have such as forceps, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and extracted the bone, it is necessary that you scrape the roughness that remains of the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other incisor;
and if any small bones remain, or any scales, remove them gently with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments that we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen speaks of, which is safer; and he praised it very strongly, and these are his words. It is necessary first that you uncover a part of the bone, there where the fracture appears most, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will put underneath the head of this lenticular incisor, of which here is the form:
And do not cut from one side, and the sharp part is on two sides, so that the cutting edge is toward the bone;
then strike with a small mallet above, so that you cut gently all around the bone, and take good care of the membrane that is below;
if it is attached to the bone, remove it gently, for one can remove it well without harm, and without fear.
And if the bone fracture does not pierce through to the membrane, and the bone is cut only on top, and there are small pieces, it is necessary to scrape this roughness, and remove the scales with a subtle scraper of which you must have different quantities, to administer in each place the most suitable, according to the operation and the shape of the fracture.
So scrape first with large scrapers, and after with more subtle ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well done.
In each of the other capillary cuts and subtle fractures, it is necessary that you administer treatment according to its direction;
and this is something that is not hidden from one who has devoted their study to this art.
And if the syfac [peritoneum] is exposed, you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth folded in two or three, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so as not to damage the syfac, then apply another bandage on top, and do not tighten it more than necessary to just hold the wound;
and leave it thus for one or two days, until the hot inflammation has subsided, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, vetch flour, frankincense powder, aristolochia, and similar things;
and make powder of these things, and put it on the wound, and always apply cleansing medicines without irritation;
and ensure that the wound is always clean, that you don't leave ointment there, nor allow pus to accumulate, for when pus gathers on the brain membrane, it corrupts and rots it, and great harm comes to the patient;
for when one puts irritating things on the syfac, it blackens on top. Take heed therefore, if any bad symptoms come to the patient, as we have said, it is doubtless worrisome.
And if blackness comes only from the medicine that was put on it, which has such properties, you must take one part honey and three parts rose oil and spread it on a cloth, and put it on the syfac; then treat it with the types of treatments that are appropriate, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both upper parts of the nose are broken, or just one by itself, for these are two bones;
and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, it only becomes dented or twisted, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must insert your little finger into the nostril, and align that broken part inside with your index finger and thumb on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and ensure that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the spot, you must align it with the head of a somewhat thick probe.
And if the break is on both sides, do the same thing, and hasten to restore it the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot inflammation has subsided, then insert tents of linen cloth into the tip of the nose, if the break is on one side.
Or insert another on the other side, if there is a break there; and let the tents be thick enough to fill the nostrils.
And some healers said that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day. It doesn't seem right to me, but they should be moistened in a mixture of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent until the bone is firm and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes one inserts goose feathers into the nose instead of tents, with a soft cloth around them, and it holds the break, and the patient can breathe through it; now do whichever you prefer.
And if hot inflammation comes to the nose while you are working on it, put a cerate or cotton moistened in rose oil, or in a little diachylon.
And if no hot inflammation comes, put a plaster on the outside, of sesame flour and frankincense powder, mixed with egg white, then put light tow on top, and do not bind the nose;
and if the break of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract it with instruments suitable for this, then sew the split, and treat it with things that generate flesh and bond, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead tubes in it until it is healed.
When the mandible is broken below, and there is no external wound, and the break is only external, and is not broken in two, except curved inward, one recognizes it easily.
It is necessary, if the break is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the break is in the left mandible, put your right hand's index finger, and push the break inward gently, and adjust it with the other hand from outside, and make it even.
And if the break of the mandible is separated in two, it is necessary that you administer extension from both parts until it is even.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, then bind them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then put wax on the broken mandible, and put a double cloth on it; and put on the cloth a large well-made splint, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the mandible, and tie it on as best you can, and command the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, untie it on the third day, and then reset what has changed; and put a plaster on it, of mill powder with egg white or sesame flour, after you have removed the wax;
and put light wool on the plaster, and if the plaster adheres, and the patient's condition doesn't change, leave it until it is healed; many times it is healed in three weeks.
And if hot swelling comes, then administer what we have said many times.
And if there is both fracture and wound together, look if any piece of bone has been removed; then work to remove it with instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, then widen it with a lancet according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remains, then sew the wound, if it is wide, and put on one of the plasters suitable for this, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The clavicle breaks several times in front, toward the shoulder, and the break is according to three manners:
either it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and is the easiest to restore;
or there is a break with wound.
And the procedure is when the break is without wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the humerus that follows the broken clavicle; and the other extends the neck toward the side;
then make even the break with your fingers, so that the form is as it should be, with neither protrusion nor depression.
And if you need to extend more, put under the patient's shoulder a round ball of cloth, or of wool, and let it be thick according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and press the ball with your hand, so that you make the break even, as it should be.
And if you cannot draw the head of the clavicle to the outside, because it goes deep, it is necessary that the patient lie supine on his nape, and put under the shoulder a medium pillow, and have the assistants push the shoulder down, until the clavicle bone is raised.
And then straighten the break with your fingers, and if you find it broken, it is necessary that you cut above;
and draw out the pieces gently, and if the bone cannot join due to some protrusion, then cut it with one of the incisors that you have; but put this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the pleura:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not hollow, and should be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the power of the work;
and it should have two ends, as you see, and one should be wide, and the other narrow, as is the opening of the wound that you have made when you have drawn out the bones;
and when you are assured against hot swelling, then sew the wound, and if the break is small, or you fear hot swelling, then fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.
And if hot swelling comes, then moisten a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and put it on.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you put on the bone a plaster of mill powder and egg white, and put light tow (flax/hemp fibers) on top, and put a sphere under the armpit, if you have need of it; then take a very large bandage of one palm width, then put a doubled cloth over the tow and the plaster; then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around this bandage, so that the ends of the bandage are hanging; and put the splint over the break, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit; and bring it back from each side, and when you see that the binding holds the break properly, and you clearly see that the splint doesn't move from the broken bone, check it each day, and when the binding loosens, tighten it;
and make the patient lie on their back, and put when they sleep a small pillow under the armpit, to raise the humerus up; thus the break of the clavicle will be eased by the raising of the shoulder, or you tie their arm to the neck, and don't unbind it unless bad symptoms appear, until 20 days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that there is need of it, and tighten it and leave it thus, until it is restored;
and it is restored at most in 28 days, and in less for some men.
Of the break of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks in the wide place or in the middle, and one knows it only by touch;
so prepare it according to the shape of the break, and bring it back to its natural form, in all the ways that you can;
then put on the place mill powder with egg white, and light tow, and put on it a doubled cloth; then put on it a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if below the splint there is hollowness in any place of the shoulder, fill that hollow with linen tow, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it firmly with a large bandage, so that the splint doesn't move from its place, and check the binding each day;
and every time it loosens, tighten it, and put the splint back in place if it is out of its position, and let the patient lie on their side;
and the shoulder is restored in 20 days or in 25.
And when this number is completed, unbind it, and be assured, for this is not a bone that moves out easily.
And if a piece of bone tends forward, and points under the skin, then cut above it, and remove it, and do what we have said in the break of the clavicle about calming hot swelling.
Of the break of the chest
The chest is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it declines downward, and the patient feels great pain, and lack of breath, and coughs, and perhaps vomits blood, and the hollow appears in the broken bone, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies supine on their back, and put a cushion between the shoulders, then press the shoulders, and bring together the ribs of both sides with your hands, and work carefully to put it even in all the ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put on plasters and tow above the thin splint of willow, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone, so that it doesn't move; and turn the binding around to the back, and tighten it properly, and check the binding every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs to be unbound, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster, and address what has come of types of treatments;
then bring back the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the breaking of ribs
Know that the breaking of ribs only comes out in thick places after the back, and at the inner end, and they only bend out because they are cartilaginous; and one feels it well during examination with the fingers.
And the treatment is that you set the break evenly, as is proper. And then apply the plaster, and tighten it with a splint, if you have need of it.
And if the break of the ribs is declining inwards, the patient feels very great pain, and stabbing, just like pleurisy, for the bone pricks the membrane; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits a great quantity of blood, and this is of serious health concern, and the ancients have applied great ingenuity to it.
And there are those who say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the break outward.
We do not do this, lest hot apostemes come, if it hasn't already come. And if it has come, then bleed it.
And some of them said that one puts cupping glasses on the place, to suck strongly, and this seems reasonable; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass might draw superfluities to the place due to the disposition of weakness.
And some of them said that one should cover the place with wool soaked in hot oil, and one puts tents between the ribs to set the binding evenly around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot suffer due to the bone that pricks the membrane, and there is danger to the patient, it is necessary to cut above the place of the broken rib, and it is necessary to put below an instrument to protect the peritoneum;
and then one must cut the bone, and draw it out gently, and then sew the two lips of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if hot aposteme comes, put on cloths soaked in rose oil, and put them on the place;
and meanwhile treat the place with what is necessary for aposteme, and have him lie supine on the side where he should, until he is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, observe if you see his hands softened and swollen and dead, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortal in most conditions, and if he moves them and feels well when one squeezes and pricks them, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if care is applied.
And if similar things come to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, observe if the feet are softened, and if the accidents are there which are in hands, and on the back comes flatulence and excretion without will;
and when one has laid him supine on his belly, excretion comes without will. And when he is laid supine on his back and he wants to defecate, he cannot. Know that he is mortal: so do not labor in his treatment.
And if these accidents do not come to him, then the thing is lighter.
And the treatment is that you observe if there is hot aposteme, then put on the spine rose oil or egg yolk oil, until it is calmed;
then put on one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a binding, and command the patient to rest; and do not let him sleep on that part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone separates, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with ointment generating flesh, until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the tail", push your little thumb of your left hand, and set it even with the other hand to your ability, then put the plaster and the splint on, if you have need of it;
then tighten it, and if there is separated bone, then cut above, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
On the breaking of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it happens, it only occurs with a small reduction at the head; and it splits lengthwise, and declines inward, and pain comes to the patient at the site, and piercing, and swelling where it's broken.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the break; and know what the break is and its shape;
and if the break is at the head only, then make that break even, until it is in its natural shape.
And if the break is lengthwise, or it declines inward, then have the patient lie on their belly, until the restoration of that break is ready for you. And when you have made it even, put the plaster on it, then put on it a splint of wood or leather, and tighten the break, so that it doesn't move;
and fill the place under the ribs, until the binding is even. And command the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if hot swelling comes there, don't touch it until the hot swelling has calmed, and put on it what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and tighten it as is appropriate, if there is no bad accident;
On the breaking of the humerus
The humerus is what is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, one must restore it according to one of two methods:
of which one is that you take a smooth piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie two ties at the two ends, and hang them high, and seat the patient on a seat;
then throw their broken arm over the wood, until it comes to the armpit, and have in the middle a curve of wood, then hang some heavy thing or have the assistant pull downward;
then let the physician make the break even with his hands together, until the break returns as it should.
And the other method is that one lays the patient on their back on their neck, and ties their hand to their neck, then commands two assistants that one holds what is above the break with their hands, and the other holds below with a tie, and each pulls to their side.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, tighten a tie below the break, and above the break, and have each of the assistants pull to their side.
And if the break is near the head of the shoulder, you must put a medium tie under the armpit, and another toward the elbow, below the break;
and also if the break is toward the elbow, you must put a tie gently, without labor, until the break is even over the place, and over the elbow;
then make the break even, as it should be, and tighten it, if hot swelling doesn't come.
And if hot swelling comes there, don't tighten it until seven days, and put on it wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot swelling has calmed;
then tighten it, and the method of tightening is that you put the plaster on the break, then bring the arm together over the humerus, and put your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and put the cloth, and tighten over the humerus, and over the arm, so that the arm serves as splints, if nothing prevents you from it, or if the bone hasn't moved.
And if you fear that the bone might move, then use splints, and put on the break a splint wider and stronger than the others, and have between each splint a finger's width of space, and let each splint be so large that it passes the break by three fingers on each side;
then tighten over the splints, as I have said at the beginning of the chapter on breaks, stronger and less in extending.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, at the time when you repair the broken limb, and you fear hot swelling, then leave it unbandaged until the seventh day, as we have said;
Then check every 3 days the binding, lest itching or swelling come to the area, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. Adjust it, as we have said.
And if no such accidents occur, do not unbind it except after 3 days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and keep his hands on his stomach;
and place under the arm a cushion filled evenly with wool, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the binding does not become loose;
adjust it through the power of medicine, and give him the food that we have prescribed before, in such a way that the food should be light at first; and when he begins to recover, let it be substantial.
And it is customary that the arm and the leg should be completely healed in 40 days; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointment medicines to straighten the area.
And if the constriction is ugly and swollen, leave it bound for 50 days or 2 months.
On the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of 2 bones, which are called the two "fociles", of which one is small, and is the one that follows the thumb;
and the other is large, and is the one that is below, toward the little finger;
by chance the large focile breaks alone, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small focile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and more difficult than when they are both broken together.
If it is the small focile that is broken alone, it needs to be extended slightly and gently, and set evenly.
And if it is the large focile, it needs to be bound more tightly;
and extend it on a cushion, and keep the thumb of the hand higher than the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher up, so that the patient does not suffer any strain;
then let the assistant extend his arm to the lower part with his hand, or with a binding, and another assistant to another at the top.
And then let the physician set it evenly, according to its best form.
And if in the break there are pieces, put each in its place, and if there is any separated piece that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut above it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the break there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter; so take the cure.
And if at the beginning of the restoration a hot swelling occurs, then apply a cloth with cerate made of rose oil and white wax, that should be neither too hard nor too soft; and bind a cloth over it subtly, until the hot swelling is calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and put there the plaster of mill powder with egg white, then put the splints, and let the splint of the break always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be 6 splints on the arm in most cases: whether the break is in one of the bones, or in both;
and tighten more over the break than elsewhere, and always less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are over the break be soft and moist, and not be hard or rough;
and let the cloths that are over the break be soft and moist, and not be hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after some days. And if any bad symptoms come to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, it is necessary that you sprinkle the limb with hot water, until this itching is calmed;
and let the limb rest not too tightly.
And then restart the tightening, and if the binding is softened and the bones separated, and similar things, then straighten it.
And if you notice that nourishment cannot reach the limb, because it is too tight, it is necessary that you loosen it a little, and leave it so for some days, until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have mentioned happens to the patient, do not unbind it until twenty days.
or thereabouts, then hang his hands from his neck, and let his neck be level, and guard against movement and tossing, and sleep on his back;
and know that this break is restored in thirty days or in thirty-five, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of strengths.
about the breaking of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers breaks occur rarely, and nothing comes but bending many times.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or bent, it is necessary that the patient sit cross-legged, and sit straight before you evenly;
then put his hand on the extended cloth, and let the assistant extend the broken bones, and let the physician set them evenly, until they are well joined;
and put the plaster and the stuffing, if abscesses don't come, then put a splint according to the size of the place; and let it be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the break is on the inside near the belly of the palm, make a ball of cloths, and command the patient to grip it with his broken palm; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and tighten it, as is necessary.
And if the break is on the outside, it is necessary that you put a splint above, and another below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and secure the binding between the fingers.
And if the break comes to any of the knuckles of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it evenly, as is necessary; and tighten it with the palm, and if you wish put a straight small splint to raise the break, and let it not move;
and if the break is in the other fingers, such as in the index or one of the others, set it evenly, and bind it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you bind them all together as one, which is better, or you put a splint on top, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and in the disposition of hot abscess, and help what comes there, as I have said.
The thighbone is often broken, and one sees it well when it turns front and back;
and the restoration is that one ties a binding above the break, and another below. And let the patient lie on his face, then let each assistant extend his binding to his side evenly;
and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is near the root of the thigh, let one of the bindings be toward the groin, and the other binding below the break.
And likewise if it is near the knee, and then let the binding be beside the knee, and let the extension be downward;
then let the physician set the bone evenly with his two hands, until it is according to its natural shape, and then put the plaster, and bind it, if hot abscesses don't come.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it calm down then return to your work and your treatment; the binding is done in this manner.
It is necessary that you wrap over the break a hard bandage doubled in 2 or 3 layers, and let the excess remain, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the buttocks, and push a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come to the top;
then wrap the bandage around the leg and thigh, then put splints on the break, and put a splint on the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to make the tightening even, then begin to bind strongly with 3 or 4 turns over the break; and as you go further up from the break, tighten it less;
then attend to the two ends of the thread that you pushed between the leg and thigh, and tie with it 3 splints that are above, then go back down to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and tighten it, so that it does not move from its place, then leave it thus, as long as there comes neither abscess nor swelling nor other such thing. And if it happens, then untie it, and address what comes, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that protrude, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to split the place, and draw them out; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken such that one puts splints there, as in the shoulder and arm;
nevertheless, in the restoration done thus, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in 50 days, or a little less or more, according to the diversity of complexions.
Know that in the kneecap breakage happens rarely, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is but a crack, or a hole, and happens with or without a wound, and this is well felt.
And the restoration is that one puts back in place what is round with one's fingers, until it is assembled as well as possible;
then put the plaster, and put a round splint, if you have need of it, and tighten it as is necessary, then watch for all the conditions that we have mentioned in other breaks, such as hot abscess and other such things; so apply to each accident what is necessary for it, until it is healed.
of the break of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is called by its right name "mustelz" (tibia), and the other is called "foscile" (fibula);
and the same break happens as comes to the arm, and because of this the restoration is like that of the arm equally, and the procedure is all one. And if the two bones are broken together, the leg turns in all directions.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the thick bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one sees it well; and it turns downward.
Then administer extension, and put it back in place, and tie the splints evenly;
but nevertheless, it is necessary if the break is ugly, and there are several pieces, that the extension be lesser and lighter; and relieve it according to your judgment.
And when you have completed all your work, then take two hollowed wooden strips that take the leg from one side and the other, and are the length of the leg from the knee down to below;
then wrap in two places a bandage above and below, and tie it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg cannot decline to right or left, and thus it is good;
and some administer a cradle the length of the leg, and it is of wood, and one puts the leg there to guard against movement, and properly one does this in the break where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is hot abscess or other accident; so treat it until it is healed.
On the breaking of foot bones
The ankle does not break, but the foot bones sometimes break and the toes rarely, and nothing happens there except crushing in several conditions.
And if there occurs a break in the foot bones, and you see these bones overlapping each other, have the patient put their foot on the ground, as if they wanted to walk, and then put your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, then press until they return to their places;
then put the plaster and tow on it, and put under the sole of the foot a small board with two flat ends, then bind it to the foot appropriately, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, undo the binding, for you will find the bones even, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then put on the broken toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then put under the foot that board that I mentioned, and bind it appropriately;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, put on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it stand on the outer end of the board beneath the sole of the foot, so that it holds well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other breaks, of which we have spoken; and treat each condition as appropriate.
On the breaking of the pubic bone
When the bone of the woman's private parts is broken, have her sit spread out, then lean her toward her back, and let her be held from behind;
then let the midwife fill the patient's private parts with cotton, and put in as much as a plug;
then push the woman, and raise the back little by little, and then the cotton comes out, until it comes to the entrance of the private parts, and the bone returns with the plug;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back, and do this for seven days or thereabouts: the break will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a reed to the opening, and push the whole bladder into the private parts; then blow strongly into the reed, until the bladder is inflated inside: the private parts will return and so will the break;
then let it be filled with cotton, and leave it thus for some days, until it is healed.
And when the pubic bone of the man is broken, or of the woman, restore it as we have said for the hip bone;
and these breaks near to it are not hidden from one who applies their study and practice to it, and understands my book.
For the break indicates in several conditions the right way of restoration: understand it then.
For the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and insert the penis into it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed quickly.
On breaks with wounds
It is necessary for one who has a break with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus or similar, that they be bled immediately, as the bloodlettings that we have mentioned testify.
And if the wound bleeds, stanch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the break in that same hour, or that day, if hot swelling does not come.
And if hot swelling comes, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the swelling has subsided, and do not touch it on the third day or the fourth, for you would cause bad complications.
And if the broken bone is visible above the exposed flesh, it is necessary that you set it gently with your hands, with little extension.
And if the extension is not ready to be aligned with your hands, then bring it back with this iron instrument, which is VII or VIII fingers long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take III or IIII of them, according to what he needs in each treatment of a fracture;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb during your work, and let it be sharp in front, and thick from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called a "lever," which is why the curved head must be placed on the head of the protruding bone; and push it at once, until it comes back, and is aligned one against the other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot properly grip the bone, then you must cut the head of the bone until the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot bring back the bone, as we have said, then cut it with an instrument suitable for this, either with a cutting tool or a saw, according to your ability;
then scrape away what remains of roughness and small fragments in the bone.
And when the bone is brought back, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
So work until it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer; and do not put on the wound any wax or other thing containing oil, as it might bring putrefaction and corruption;
then apply splints when you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take great care that the wound is not bound together with the fracture;
and many times foolish physicians have done this, and have brought upon the patient either death or sometimes corrosion; and let the binding be softer and gentler than with other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad accidents might come, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you should not put splints on it; but wrap around, in place of splints, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after I or II days pus forming in the wound, remove what you have put on with the wine, and apply healing ointment, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is joined and healed.
And the limb must be arranged in such a way that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but constantly produces pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, which is why you must probe the wound with a probe, and remove all these separated pieces that are causing that pain.
And if a fistula comes to the place, or another manner of corruption, then you must treat it according to what is said in its chapter above.
And when the bone is broken, and protrudes from the limb, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, and other similar large members, do not pull it out, for death often comes from this, but leave it until it rots;
perhaps it will fall off by itself after XX or XXX days, then treat the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
We often see them after the healing of the break, especially when it's near the joint, and the appearance of the limb is ugly to look at; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take note then if the swelling is fresh: if so, administer astringent medicines, such as aloe, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and mix them with astringent wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and put them on the swelling with tow, and bind it well, and don't unwrap it for several days;
and put them on the swelling with tow, and bind it well, and don't unwrap it for several days; and then unwrap it, and begin another one, until the swelling is removed;
or you press a well-made piece of lead on it; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings above the limbs;
and if the swelling has already turned to hardness like stone, and it needs to be removed, then cut above it, and split the visible excess; or you scrape it with some razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
about the limb that is weak after healing
When the bone break is restored, and afterwards the limb remains weak and thin, it happens for many causes: of which one is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or due to excessive moistening; or due to too much movement, not at the right time; or because there is little blood in their body, so it is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient eat, and make the body tender, until blood is multiplied in them; and administer baths, and give them joy and happiness;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch draws great nourishment to it, and moisten it often with lukewarm water, until nourishment flows to the limb; and it returns to its natural form.
about the twisted limb after healing When the limb is twisted after restoration, and the broken bone is visible, and the form of the limb is ugly, yet it doesn't lose its natural function:
don't believe the fools who say one must break the limb anew, and many foolish doctors have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
however, if the swelling and twisting are fresh, then they should be moistened with hot water, where softening herbs have been cooked, such as marsh mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and take marsh mallow mucilage, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and make a plaster on it;
or take fat figs, and grind them with pigeon dung, and similar medicines that reduce the joining.
And sometimes the swelling is removed by continuous and long rubbing with moist hands. And movement should be administered to the limb each hour.
And if the twisting is old and hardened, like stone, and needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut to the bone, with a subtle cutting tool gently; and put care and attention into the treatment.
Dislocation is the exit of any joint from its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is badly shaped, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When dislocation comes to someone, it must be reduced immediately without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it is returned to place with difficulty;
therefore one must not move it at the time when it is swollen: many times it causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave them, until the hot swelling has calmed;
then moisten the limb with hot water and oil, then reduce it gently, and treat each limb as the treatment will come in its place.
And I have ordered the chapters of dislocations from the head to the feet.
It rarely happens that both jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both occurs in two ways: either they are slightly removed from their places, and softened a bit; or they are completely dislocated, and hang toward the chest, and saliva runs from the mouth which cannot be contained, nor can the mouth be closed, and the tongue is involved affecting speech.
When the dislocation is small, it often returns by itself in several situations.
And if it is complete and total, it must be reduced quickly, without delay;
and in such a way that the assistant holds the patient's head, and the physician puts his thumb at the root of the jaw dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on both sides; and the other fingers of the hands should be outside, to make it even;
and order the patient to soften their jaws and move them in all directions. And the physician should align it until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if it's both jaws together, moisten them with hot water and oil until you can reduce them easily;
do not delay in reducing them, as we have said.
And when they are evenly reduced, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, put on cloths moistened in a cerote made of rose oil and wax, then bind it gently with soft bandages;
and the patient should sleep on their back, with their head positioned between two cushions so they move it neither right nor left, and should not attempt to chew, but take light food until the pains are gone and the jaws are knit;
and then they may eat what they want easily, and not strain to open the mouth while eating and drinking, until the jaw is well knit and healed.
And if both jaws cannot be reset at once, and are not converted to their places, fevers and customary headaches come, and perhaps looseness of bowels, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is destruction; and many times the one to whom this happens dies within nine days.
The clavicle cannot dislocate on the inner side where it continues to the chest, and it is sometimes dislocated outward, and one can feel it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies supine on their back, and extends their arms; and then press the place strongly with your palm, and it will return;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and tighten it;
and the end that is toward the elbow cannot dislocate; if only a little, and if it dislocates sometimes, return it to its place, as we have said;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and tighten it, and command the patient to rest until they are healed;
and in the same way is returned the head of the shoulder, when it is separated from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is only dislocated in three ways:
of which one is that it dislocates to the part of the armpit below; and the second is to the part of the chest; and perhaps it dislocates to the upper part, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate backward because of the shoulder blade, and does not dislocate inward because of the nerves;
and most often it dislocates below toward the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in them it jumps out quickly;
in those who have much flesh, it comes out with difficulty, and goes back with difficulty.
And perhaps it happens to some men that percussion or breaking occurs, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and one thinks it is dislocated because of this.
It is necessary therefore that you examine it until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is down towards the armpit, and there is a difference between the sick shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a manifest diversity between them; and you will find at the head of the shoulder a hollow, and below the armpit when touching, the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone; and the patient cannot bring their hand to their nose, nor move it in any way;
and likewise, if it is dislocated upward, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly by touching;
and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reduce when it is recent, or if the patient is a child.
And the method is that the assistant raises the patient's hand up high, then put your thumbs under the armpit, and forcefully raise the joint up to its place; and the assistant raises the hand, and extends it upward, then puts it down; it will come back quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days after, it is necessary that the patient be bathed in hot water; and administer softening and soothing irrigation, such as a decoction of marshmallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and let it be administered;
then let the patient lie on their back, and put under the armpit an even roll of wool, neither too soft nor too hard, then let the physician put his heel on the roll, and forcefully raise the head of the shoulder, and pull the patient's hand;
and another assistant should hold the patient's head, so that it does not move downward; that shoulder comes back immediately, and if you wish you can reduce it according to this method:
and that is that you have present a man who is taller than the patient; and he should stand straight beside them, and push his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit up, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another assistant pulls the patient's hand down toward the belly. And if the patient is too light, hang something heavy with them, and the dislocation returns immediately.
And one can also reduce it in another way:
and that is to plant a long pole in the ground, whose head should be as round as a pestle, and neither too thick nor too thin; then put it under the patient, but with soft cloths on it, and the patient should stand along the length of the pole;
then their hand should be strongly extended down on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return despite all these things we have said, then do this treatment: take a pole two arms long and four fingers wide, which has a round head to better enter deeply under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths on the head of the pole, so that the pole does not hurt the patient, then put it under the patient's armpit;
and extend their arm along the pole lengthwise, and tie the upper arm to the pole, and the arm at the hand, then put the arm on a rung of a ladder widthwise, and let the hand be extended down, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint goes back in immediately.
And when it is in, by whatever method, it is necessary that you put under the armpit an even ball of wool, then put the plaster prepared with mill powder, with incense and egg white, over all the shoulder and around it, then arrange it suitably under the armpit, and wrap the bandage over the plaster, and bind the hand to their neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And it is necessary that they eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after 5 or 7 days, and move it; and if it is firm and is not softened, then it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come there, or for another cause, it is necessary that you administer cautery at 3 holes, as it is put before in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and he unwraps after 7 days, and the joint doesn't hold, and he cannot raise his arm up, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never again be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is toward the chest and breasts, or behind, is treated by pushing and extending of hands, and another binding is administered;
and treat until it is healed.
And if after healing there comes heaviness to the limb, and slowness in movement, the patient should use baths many times, until this heaviness is lightened, and returns to its original nature.
On the dislocation of the elbow
Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and with difficulty returns;
and if it is dislocated from all parts, and especially front and back, the dislocation is not hidden, for one can see it well and feel it well; and it dislocates according to each configuration. And when you join the sick elbow with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is hollow, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder at all.
And it is necessary that you return it before hot swelling comes, for if hot swelling came, the return would be difficult;
and perhaps it cannot be returned completely, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps death comes.
And the restoration is, when it is such that one can return it, that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arm should be spread, and the physician's hands around the elbow, above and below, and push the joint with his thumbs together, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is to the front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and strikes the dislocated elbow with the base of the palm.
And if it does not want to return to place, administer strong extension;
and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm from each side, after you have wrapped a long and wide doubled cloth;
and when the physician has joined the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint strongly until it returns;
and when it is in place, put on it a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it strongly, and hang the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it some days, then unwrap it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, unwrap the binding and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, restart the plaster and the binding, and leave it thus some days, until it is firmly set; then unwrap it.
And if he feels heaviness after the return of the joint, and it moves, bathe it and rub gently, and press until it is relieved; or you put on the joint a fat sheep's fleece, then leave it a day and a night, then remove it, and make him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then put the fleece back on, and then enter the bath; and do this 2 or 3 times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, put on moist cow dung heated with butter, and bind it on top;
it will return to its disposition.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and the return is easier than other joints. Nevertheless, it must be returned to place hastily, in the same hour that it is dislocated, before the place swells, or hot swelling comes.
And the return is that you put the sick hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and the physician puts it equal, so that he puts his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
However, you must check if it is properly in place; then have the patient place the back of their hand on a table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, have the patient place the back of their hand on the table, and the physician should place his hand on the visible part of the joint.
If it returns immediately, that's good. If not, bind it with poultices that calm hot swellings, and leave it thus without starting over.
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put it in place after some days, the joint remains twisted;
and it does not harm the patient except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerves are cut, or the artery;
there is no other solution except to cauterize near the injury, and perhaps nothing else will work.
And when the hand is in place, put on the poultice that we mentioned, then bind it and leave it for 5 days, then unbind it and leave it thus.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some difficulty, moisten it with hot water, and rub it until it is healed.
on the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated to each side, sometimes to the back of the palm or to the palm;
then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it toward the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for 2 days, and then set it straight that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it during the day, and make it move, and rebind it at night;
and do this often, until it is tight, and do the same if it is dislocated in the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do the same when it is dislocated to another side.
on the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death hastens to the patient.
And the signs are that excrement comes out without control, nor can they hold it, and often some limbs are paralyzed, either both thighs or both arms or one.
And often the spine moves in 4 directions;
the one that moves to the back is called "gibbosity":
the treatment is that you look if the gibbosity has come from childhood: if so, there is no cure or healing at all.
And for that which comes from falling or from blows or from similar things, the ancients spoke of methods of treatment with grand words, in which there is not much profit in all;
but I have abbreviated it according to my understanding, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that for the gibbosity that comes to the chest in front, there is no device or cure;
and also that which comes directly to both sides, and one cannot cure except specifically that which comes to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient should be extended on his face in a level place, and have straw beneath him, so he does not hurt himself;
then drive a stake firmly into the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a band below the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants should pull the bands, one at the head and the other at the feet, through the two stakes;
and the stakes should be well secured, as we have said, and the physician should place his palms firmly on the spine, until it returns.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and dig under the wall, and the patient should be on his side, and push the head of the board under the wall, then put the middle of the board on the spine; and the physician should put his feet on the other end of the board, and press well, until it returns to place;
and if you wish, do it with the hand-turned winch. And it is that you fix 2 posts at the head of the patient at an arm's length, and towards the feet 2 others, and there should be between each post, above and below, a palm's width of space in length;
and each post should have 1 hole, where the turner runs, and the posts should be firmly in the ground, so they do not move;
and between each 2 posts there should be 1 turning post, on which the bindings turn, and there should be on 2 turners 2 small posts of a palm's length, to turn the turner;
and then tie the binding that goes through the armpits to the turner towards the head, and the other binding towards the feet to the other turner, and each of the assistants turns their turner with all the binding, and the master puts the spine straight as we have said.
And when it is straight, put on it a drying plaster with egg white, and then the tow, and then the splint of a small board three fingers long, that covers the place of the hump and the part of the healthy vertebra, then bind it with a binding, as we have said, and the patient should use subtle nourishment, until he is healed;
and if anything comes at the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we mentioned before; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the back vertebra of the spine, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone that appears, which is why one should not have presumption about it: by chance it would bring death.
Know that in the joints of the hip and in the joints of the shoulder there only comes dislocation, and it does not come as in other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated according to 4 parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward than elsewhere, and little dislocated forward and backward.
And the recognition of its dislocation inward is that when one joins the sick leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the sick knee appears more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee to the fire; and the place beside it is swollen with hot swelling, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of one whose dislocation is outward is that these symptoms are contrary to those mentioned before.
And the signs of one whose dislocation is forward are that he extends his leg well according to completion; however, he does not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make him walk, he cannot go forward, and retains his urine, and the groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the signs of one whose dislocation is backward are that he cannot spread his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is at the place below the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you look if the dislocation is old, and it remains according to its disposition, there is no cure; and one should not have presumption about it.
And in one whose dislocation is fresh, and it is of the 4 types of dislocation, hurry to turn the joint, and stretch it inside and outside, and move it right and left; by chance it will return, and needs no other cure.
And if it does not return in this manner, it is necessary that you prepare 1 strong assistant, and stretch the leg strongly with 2 hands, or with 1 binding that is tied above the knee; and another assistant should extend his hand above in such a way that he puts his hands under his armpits, then bind him with a soft binding over the thigh; and another should hold the head of the binding;
and they all stretch up and down at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to all four types, and if the dislocation is reduced, as we have said, that is good.
If not, then it is necessary to apply treatment according to its type.
When the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that you lay the patient on his healthy side, then put the bandage on the root of the thigh, and the place below the groin, then extend the bandage upward toward the groin, and toward the collarbone;
then let another assistant take his arms, and embrace the thick part of the diseased thigh, and extend it outward strongly: it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot secure it in this way that we have described, it is necessary that you tie the two feet of the patient together with a strong gentle bandage above the two heels, and above the two knees, and let the diseased leg be extended two fingers longer than the other;
then let him be hung from the head of a beam, and be raised from the ground two arms' length;
then command an assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who strongly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately hastily.
And when the dislocation is outward, let the patient lie, as we have said for the one who has a hump, and tighten a bandage on the diseased leg specifically, and on the chest also;
then put two poles, one at the head and another at the feet, then fix a pole between the patient's thighs in the middle of the form; and have plenty of moist cloths around, so it doesn't hurt the patient, then let each assistant pull toward himself, and let the physician put the dislocation back in place with his hand.
If it returns, that is good.
If not, put it on a table, and press it as we have said for the hump, and let the patient lie on the healthy side.
And when the dislocation is forward, it is necessary to extend the diseased leg hastily, and according to what I have said; and let the physician make an effort to be above the diseased groin, then press with the other hand, and extend it downward toward the knee.
And if the dislocation is outward, it is not necessary to extend the patient downward, nor raise him from the ground, rather it is necessary that he be as if the hip was dislocated outward, as we have said about lying on the two hips; and let him be on his face, and the bandage extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint with the table; and it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they are equal; then join the thighs, and put the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and let him rest three or four days, then unbind it, and put the plaster on;
and if you see that they are equal, bind it, as before, and leave it three days;
then unbind it, and make him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
On the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inward and outward, and backward;
and does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you command the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not attach to his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit straight, and extend his leg if he can, and put your back on his face, and put his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull back between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that it attaches his leg to his thigh easily;
and put the plaster on, and make the leg attach to the thigh, and bind them together strongly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and let the patient not trouble himself with walking, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not right, then administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes moved, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inward and outward.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and tends forward to the part where it is dislocated:
the reduction is easy, and one should extend it gently with one's hands when it is only moved.
And when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright, and a strong assistant should hold them by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot toward you with your right hand, and then with the left hand two times, then extend it upward, and gently push the foot upward;
and do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot;
if it returns, that is good;
if not, then begin the work again, for it will return;
and if it cannot return this way, make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly plant a stake in the ground between their thighs, and tie cloths around it, so it doesn't hurt the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a band, which he ties over the top of the foot; then let each assistant pull equally, and let the stake remain between the patient's thighs to hold the patient when they pull;
then let the physician align the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant should hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, put the plaster and tow on it, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves that are behind the ankle, that the binding is not too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the binding loosens, tighten it;
then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if they walk before this term, there is no certainty that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot swelling comes, it is necessary that you calm it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.
of the toes When the toes are dislocated, it is necessary to gently extend them without effort, and this is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the top of the foot, it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a flat place or on a table completely straight, and put your foot on what appears of these joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is aligned, and nothing appears, put a board with two ends under the sole of the foot, then bind it firmly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and make them rest until it is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, not bold;
and use at the beginning things that calm hot swelling, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, then return the limb to its place immediately, before the hot swelling comes;
and when the limb is in place, administer things that calm hot swelling, and treat the wound, as necessary, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is breakage, and small separated bones, then remove them, and do what we have said in simple diseases;
and beware of entering the path of fear, according to what I have said, for this serves you better according to your Creator, and for the safety of your soul and body.
