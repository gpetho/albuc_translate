The author of this book says: When I had completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is a part of the science of medicine in its completeness, and had reached the utmost point in it of clarity and explanation, I saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the work of the hand.
Because the work of the hand is entirely lacking in our country and in our time, so much so that its science has almost been forgotten and its practice has ceased. And there remain only a few traces of it in the books of the ancients, which have been copied by hands and marred by error and confusion, so that its meaning has become obscure and its usefulness has been diminished.
Therefore I saw fit to revive it and to compose this treatise on it in a way that is explanatory, clear, and concise, and to include pictures of cauterizing irons and other surgical instruments, since this adds to the clarity and is a great help to what is needed.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman in our time is that the craft of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen. Until he understands the functions, forms, temperaments, connections, and separations of the organs, and the knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, their number, origins, and the pulsating and non-pulsating vessels, and the locations of their origins.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of surgery. We have mentioned some of this in the introduction to this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned of anatomy will inevitably make mistakes that kill people, as I have often seen among those who have imagined themselves knowledgeable in this science and claimed it without knowledge or training.
And that is because I saw an ignorant physician who incised a pig-like swelling in a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck's arteries, so the woman bled until she fell dead before him.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to remove a stone from a man who was suffering from a fistula, and the stone was large. He acted rashly and removed it with a piece of the bladder's substance. And the man died after about three days, and I had been called to remove it; I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that I could have estimated it.
And I saw another physician who earned his living from some of the brothel keepers of our city through medicine.
Then a black boy came to him who had a fracture in his leg near the heel, together with a wound. The physician, in his ignorance, hastily bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints very tightly, and did not leave the wound any space to breathe.
Then he indulged his desires, and left him for some days, and ordered him not to unbind the bandages until his leg and foot swelled and he was close to death.
Then I was called to him, and I hastened to unbind the bandages, so he found relief and recovered from his pains, except that the corruption had become firmly established in the limb and I could not prevent it.
Then the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician cauterize a cancerous tumor, which ulcerated after several days, until the misfortune of its owner increased.  That is because if the cancer is purely of black humor, then it should not be treated with iron at all.
Except that it be in a member which can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual operations are divided into two parts: an operation accompanied by safety and an operation accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned in every place that comes in this book about the operation which contains danger and fear, so you should avoid it and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to speak and criticize, therefore take for yourselves caution and circumspection, and for your patients gentleness and deliberation.
And use the best method leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases which are difficult to cure.
And purify yourselves from that which you fear might cast suspicion upon your religion and your worldly affairs; for this is more enduring for your reputation and higher in this world and the next for your status.
For Galen said in some of his precepts: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you become a bad physician.
This chapter is divided into three sections.
The first section.
Concerning cauterization with fire and cauterization with strong medicine, arranged from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments and cautery irons, and everything needed for the work by hand.
And the second section.
Concerning incision, puncturing, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and the like, all arranged in chapters, with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third section.
Concerning setting, reduction, and the treatment of fractures and the like, arranged in chapters from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first section.
Concerning cautery.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary that we mention the manner of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
And I say that the discussion concerning the manner of the benefit of cautery and its harms is a long discussion, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and a number of wise men have spoken of it.
And they differed concerning it, and I have shortened from their speech a little, for fear of lengthening.
And I say that cautery, generally speaking, benefits every bad temperament that is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments, and they are the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed concerning it.  Some of them said that cautery is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite, that cautery is not suitable in a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to be cured from a hot dry disease with a hot dry medicine. And he who says the opposite said that cauterization with fire may benefit from a hot dry disease that occurs in the bodies of people. Because when you add the body of man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the body of man cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that one should not form an opinion on that matter except one who has practiced and trained in the art of cautery to a great extent. And he has observed the differences in the temperaments of people and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their duration.
But as for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially the cold and moist diseases.  All the physicians have agreed on them and have not differed in the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, O my sons, that among the secrets of treatment is cautery with fire, and its advantage over cautery with a burning medicine, because fire is a simple element whose action does not extend beyond the member which is cauterized, nor does it harm another member connected to it except a little harm.
And cautery with a burning medicine may extend its action to what is beyond the members, and perhaps it causes in the member a disease difficult to treat, and perhaps it kills.  Fire, because of its nobility and the excellence of its essence, does not do that except if one is excessive.
And this has become clear to us through experience, long service, attention to the craft, and understanding of the realities of the matter.
For this reason I have dispensed with lengthy discussion.  Were it not that it is not fitting for this book of mine, I would have presented to you concerning fire a hidden secret and the manner of its action in bodies and its removal of diseases with philosophical, demonstrative speech too subtle for your understanding.
And know, O my sons, that they have differed concerning the time suitable for cautery, and they have considered the best time to be springtime.
And I say that cautery is suitable at any time, because the harm resulting from the time is consumed by the benefit which is brought about by cautery. Especially if the cautery is for strong, necessary, urgent pains which do not tolerate delay, because of what is feared from them that a calamity will follow which is greater than the slight harm incurred from the time.
And let it not occur to you, O my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cautery which cures a certain disease will never recur, and that you should make it a necessary procedure.
And the matter is not as they suppose, because cautery is only like a medicine which changes the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
Except that cautery is preferred to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its effect.
And it is possible that the disease may return after a time, according to the temperament of the patient, the strength and hold of his disease, and what is prepared in his body from the gathering of humors in it, and his neglect of himself in acquiring them from foods and the like of causes.
Except that the disease in which cautery is used is a mild disease and in a member with few humors and moistures. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like; it is possible that that pain may not return, and that is in the least.
And as for the common people's saying also that cautery is the last of medicine, it is a true saying, not to what they go to, for they believe that no treatment benefits with medicine or otherwise after the occurrence of cautery, and the matter is otherwise.
And the meaning of cautery being the last of medicine is only that when we use types of treatment in a disease and those medicines do not work, then we use cautery as the last thing, and it works; from here it came to pass that cautery is the last of medicine. Not in the sense to which the common people and many ignorant physicians went.
The ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence, and they said that the place of cauterization does not suppurate; and that is not absolutely the case.
Because I have tried that and found that it only does that in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is better and superior to iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron in the fire, made of gold, you cannot determine when it is heated to the degree you want, due to the redness of the gold.
And because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase the heat on it, it melts in the fire and flows, so the craftsman is troubled by that; therefore, cauterization with iron is quicker and closer to the truth for us to work with, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections which I have organized from head to foot, to make it easier for the student what he wants from it, God willing.
The first chapter.
Cauterization of the head, one cauterization.
This cauterization benefits from the predominance of moisture and cold on the brain, which are the cause of headache and frequent colds from the head to the area of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, and toothache and throat pain. And in short, for every illness that occurs from cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit with a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habit of the patient.
Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then you seat him before you cross-legged, having placed his hands on his chest.
Then you place the base of your hand on the root of his nose between his eyes; where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, which is of this form.
Expose the bone to the extent of the head of a toothpick or the size of a carob seed; then lift your hand, otherwise replace your hand with the same or another instrument if it has cooled. Until you see of the bone what I mentioned to you; then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a cotton ball in it, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton ball soaked in fat over it and leave it until the scab from the cautery is gone; then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they have said that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus is discharged, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned cauterizing the skin to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the thickness of the bone is burned, then removing what is burned from the bone afterward, then treating it.
And others said that one should exaggerate with the cautery until it strongly affects the bone, so that it falls from the bone in the form of a carat or a small flake; and they claimed that this vents the vapors of the head from that place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals.  I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people and by way of risk; and leaving it, in my opinion, is better and safer.  For if there is [a problem], the head weakens whenever its natural connection is disrupted, as we have seen in other organs.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore, act according to it and be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
Also on cauterizing the head.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and persists in the patient, and applications, collyria, snuffs, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if he has been cauterized with the single cautery that we described, and nothing of that has benefited him, then look. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, cauterize him again a little above the previous cautery. Then cauterize each temple of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone that we described is uncovered. And cauterize him at the back of his head in the place known as the hatchet, and lighten your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient will find this very painful, unlike the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head; and I will mention this cautery in its place.
The cautery with which the temples and the back of the head are cauterized should be gentler than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.  And this is its image.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in a fissure of the head, with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then let the patient vomit with purgative medicines for the head, and use all the treatment that I have mentioned in the classifications of diseases.  If that does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, take a single clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides. Then, incise the place of pain in the temple with a wide lancet until there is a space under the skin large enough for the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears, then bind it tightly with bandages, and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Apply a cotton swab soaked in butter until the place suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.  And if you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines which I mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with iron, it is in this manner: heat the cautery iron, whose image is this:
It is called the nail cautery because its head is like the head of a nail, with some perforation and a small projection in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron little by little, and the amount you burn should be about half the thickness of the skin. And lift your hand so that you do not burn the artery beneath, causing bleeding. Then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days. Then dress the cotton with ointment and treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like end of the cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this, especially chronic, migraine.
Chapter Four.
Cauterization of chronic migraine.
If you treat the migraine with the aforementioned treatments and what we mentioned in the classifications of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and you see a cause for which the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire is not sufficient. Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it glows white, after you have marked the painful area with a line the length of half a finger or so, and you should move your hand once while pulling it so that you cut the artery and reach towards the bone.
However, you should be careful not to touch the jaw which moves when chewing, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, which would cause spasm.
And be cautious and watchful of bleeding from the artery that you cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what he is doing and is not a skilled and experienced practitioner;  it is better to leave the procedure undone.
And the treatment of bleeding that occurs from an artery will be mentioned in its place in the book, God willing; if you see a condition that this cauterization does not address.
And you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize in the middle of the head as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on artery ligation with the double-bladed cautery, for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.
Chapter Five.
On cauterizing earaches.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold, and it is treated with purgatives and other treatments that we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery which is called the point, whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, apply it around the entire ear, as it goes around, or around both if the pain is in both. And keep the cauterization a little away from the root of the ear, after marking the place with ink. The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear or thereabouts. Then treat the areas until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Six.
Cauterization of Paralysis.
The paralysis treated by cauterization is that type which arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
And one should avoid cauterizing the type which arises from dryness and nervous tension.
When you have treated this type of paralysis with ointments, snuffs, and gargles, and your treatment has been ineffective, then the patient should be cauterized with three cauterizations. One at the base of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
And make your cauterization on the opposite side from the diseased side, for the relaxation occurs on the side which appears healthy.
And the image of the cauterization is that you cauterize with a cauterization opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin.  This is the image of the cautery, and it is a type of scalpel, the image of which we have presented earlier, but it is a little gentler than it, as you see. The knife should have a little excess thickness. Then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
Cauterization of the chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned and your treatment is not effective and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize it four times. One cauterization on each temple, one cauterization in the middle of the head as previously mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head as previously described.
The application of the cautery is as previously described.  It may also be cauterized on the stomach's opening, which will be more effective, then treat it as previously described.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
If it is caused by phlegm, the patient should first be given strong purgatives and pills that cleanse the brain.
Then his entire head should be shaved and a mustard plaster, described in the chapter on plasters, should be applied to the back of his head repeatedly, for this is a type of cauterization.
Do this in exactly the order I have described there. If he is cured by this, well and good; otherwise, cauterize him three times on the back of his head, in a line from the top of the head to the nape of the neck.
Make the space between each cauterization the width of a finger. Then treat the cauterization as described above. If you wish to increase [the treatment] and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize in the middle as well.
If you wish to increase [the treatment], cauterize on the temples, then treat until he is cured.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
Cauterization for paralysis and general body relaxation.
It is necessary that you first proceed to purify the head with the purgatives and what we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head, then cauterize: one cauterization in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If, in the case of relaxation of the body, you need more than that, and the patient can tolerate it and the disease is strong and intractable, then cauterize four times on the vertebrae of his back. And reach with the cautery until you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand and then treat him as previously mentioned until he heals, God willing.  The cautery should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
Cauterization for Epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  It is necessary first to cleanse his brain with strong purgatives and with all the treatment that we have mentioned in the classification, if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking medicine.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicine, then let him use gargles and masticatories that cleanse the brain for many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then his head is shaved, and then one cauterization is performed in the middle of the head as previously described, and another cauterization at its back. And one cauterization on each temple of his head. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then perform the cauterizations that were mentioned for the patient with paralysis and body relaxation, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back, and the cautery should be olive-shaped as previously described.
If the patient is a child, then make the cautery gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then perform the cauterizations that we mentioned for the patient with paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined toward black bile and the patient's body is moist, then purge him with that which cleanses his brain, as has been explained in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a firm cake of linen like a circle, then place it in the middle of his head while the patient sits cross-legged holding it from each side, then take one pound of old sheep fat.
Then heat it over a fire with moderate heat, to the extent that the finger can tolerate it when inserted, then pour it into the middle of his head in the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once a week, along with all other good treatment, until he is cured, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small punctures, without holding your hand on the cautery, but rather by sprinkling; for this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton wool compress soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing the descending water in the eye.
If the descending water in the eye becomes apparent to you through the signs I mentioned in the classification, then act quickly and purge the patient of whatever pollutes his head, and cleanse him of all humors, and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and apply a cautery to the middle of the head, then apply two cauteries to the temples if the descent of water began in both eyes, or to one side if it was in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries under the skin, and let the cauterizations be lengthwise across the width of the temples, and guard against bleeding.
If you see any of it, cut it immediately with whatever treatment is possible, and we will address the wisdom in cauterizing and cutting the arteries and guarding against bleeding.
And it may be cauterized at the nape of the neck under the two bones with two deep cauterizations.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and are from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, outside the head, and you are certain that it is from cold, thick, phlegmatic excess, then cauterize it with the cauterization described earlier for the descending water. A cauterization in the middle of the head and two cauterizations on the temples and two cauterizations at the nape of the neck under the two bones. And if you need more, then cauterize one cauterization on each side of the corner of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing the foul smell of the nose.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment is not effective, then quickly purge the patient with colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle cauterization with the olive-shaped cautery iron. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery iron two cauterizations above the eyebrows, a little below the hair, and be careful of the artery, do not cut it.  And this is the image of the nail-shaped [cautery iron].
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing the relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes from illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize a little above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, and keep them distant from the temples, and let the length of each cauterization be along the length of the eyebrow.
And do not exaggerate your hand with the cautery, but only to the extent that a third of the skin burns, and the shape of the cautery iron is like this.
Chapter sixteen.
In cauterizing the eyelid.
If its margins turn inward so that it pricks the eye, then cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a burning medicine. As for cauterization with fire, you should order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelashes alone, if he is one who plucks them, until they grow long and even.
If it pricks him while they are growing, then tie his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.  Then when they have grown and become even, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark on the eyelid with ink a sign in the shape of an Asiatic leaf.
The beginning of the mark should be near the margins, then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard. Then heat a cautery iron; this is its shape.
Then cauterize according to the shape you marked, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the Asiatic leaf, is entirely burned, especially its surface.  A sign of the correctness of your work is that you see the eyelid contract and the hair rise from the flesh of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days, then apply cotton with butter to it until the eschar separates. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If some of the hair returns after a time and the eyelid relaxes,
repeat the cauterization on that place as you did at first. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and the hair does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a burning medicine, it is that you instruct the patient to leave the margins until they grow long and become even.
Then make from paper a shape like an Asiatic leaf. Then take of the usual soap and of unslaked lime, of each one a drachm in weight or thereabouts, and crush them both together very finely. Do this quickly lest it dry. Then spread some of it on the paper which you made in the shape of an Asiatic leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids. Place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head in your lap.
And place your index finger above the medicine and hold it lightly, moving it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medicine, for he will feel a burning sensation. As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the burning stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And observe; if you see that the eyelid has risen as it rises when cauterized with fire or by cutting, otherwise repeat the application of the medicine to the place where the medicine did not take effect and did not become black, until you complete your work and the eyelid is cauterized. Then apply cotton with butter to it until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with palm ointment or the like until it heals.  It is necessary for you during the procedure to be extremely careful that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after some days and there is some fear of hair in the eye,
then reapply the medicine to that place of the eyelid which has relaxed, specifically as you did before, then treat it until it heals. This is the image of an Asiatic leaf.
And know that people's eyes differ in size, so let your cauterization be according to that. The correct method is not hidden from one who is experienced in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
Concerning the cauterization of the canthus which appears in the corner of the eye.
If you treat the fistula with what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
You order the patient to place his head in your lap, and a servant holds his head in front of you, holding it still so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then you place a cotton ball moistened with egg white or with the saliva of a frog on his eyes, then you heat the cautery iron, which is of this form.
It is hollow like the quill of an eagle's feather from one end, which is the end used for cauterization; and if you wish, it may be perforated at the other end, and if you wish it may be solid like a bodkin, but this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then you squeeze the fistula if it is open and remove the matter from it and dry it; or if it is not open, you open it and remove its pus. Then you apply the cautery iron to it while it is very hot, holding it with your hand until you reach the bone.
And move your hand slightly away during cauterization, from the eye towards the nose, lest your hand slip or the patient move, and the cautery iron fall into the conjunctiva and damage it. If you reach the bone with the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, reapply the cautery iron a second time if you need to.
And leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with butter to it and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and treat it according to what will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some of the ancients: you approach the location of the fistula, incise it, then place in the incision itself a thin cone, this is its image.
And you pour into it the weight of a dirham of molten lead, and hold your hand firmly on the cone, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead flow into his eye. And you should place on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or water.
For the lead burns the location of the fistula and heals it wonderfully. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment we have mentioned, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to use nasal perforation and return the fistula to the nasal passage, as will be described in its specific place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing a cleft lip.
A cleft often occurs in the lip, called a hair, especially in the lips of boys; it occurs frequently. If you treat this cleft with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery of this shape.
Its cavity should be as fine as a knife. Then quickly apply it, hot, to the cleft itself, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft, then treat it with the qiryūṭī until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing a canker sore occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and from the flow of pus a fistula results, and you treat it but the treatment is not effective, then you should heat a cautery to the extent that it fits into the fistula.
Then insert it, hot, into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterwards with what we have mentioned of treatment, until it heals, God willing.
If the material is cut off and it heals, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the decayed bone, according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On cauterizing loose molars and gums.
If the gums are relaxed from moisture and the molars become loose, and you have treated them with medicine but it has not worked, then place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron, whose image comes after this, after you place the tube on the tooth.
And insert the hot cautery iron quickly, and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then raise your hand, then return the cautery iron several times, as much as you want, then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water.
And let him hold it for an hour and then spit it out; for the loose tooth will become firm, and the relaxed gum will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry.
Chapter twenty-one.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is from cold, or if there are worms in it, and treatment with medicine has not worked, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with butter, or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with butter, you take cow's butter and melt it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then you take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the melted butter and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat it several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. And if you wish, you may dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron on top of it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, take a copper or iron tube, somewhat thick in its body so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth, then heat the cautery iron which is of that shape and place it on the tooth itself and hold your hand until the cautery iron cools. Do this repeatedly.
Then the pain will go away either that same day or the next. After the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out. This is the image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, and as is possible. This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing the gums.
If the gums are due to phlegm and cold humors and do not yield to ripening by medication, and you desire rapid ripening, then heat a hollow cautery iron, which has this form, perforated at both ends.
So that the smoke exits at the other end during cauterization, place it carefully on the tumor itself once or twice, if necessary, until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton swab soaked in butter to it until what was burnt by the fire is gone. Then treat it with ointment and tents until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humors prevail over the windpipe, especially if this is accompanied by coldness of temperament, then the patient should first be purged with laxative medicines, then cauterize with a cautery in the hollow of the neck at the root of the throat in the lower position.
Beware of reaching the throat with the cautery and do not burn more than half of the skin. Then cauterize another cautery at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra; and let the cautery be nail-shaped in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter twenty-four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the disease is chronic, cauterize two cauteries above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty places, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And let the cautery be nail-shaped, in the manner previously described. And if you wish, let your cautery be by puncturing with the cautery called the point, the image of which has been previously shown in puncturing earache, and let the punctures be from thirty points or thereabouts.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers.  You may also make a cautery with three branches in this form, and it expedites the cauterization because you cauterize three cauteries at once with it. This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated because of slippery humors, or if it does not remain fixed when it is reduced from its dislocation so that this becomes a habit for it to return and then dislocate at the slightest movement exposed, as we have witnessed, then it is necessary to reduce the joint first. Then the patient lies on his back or on the healthy side, and then the skin inside the armpit is lifted upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery iron with two heads, whose image is this.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will be four cauterizations.  It may be cauterized with a cautery iron with three heads, in which case the shape of the cauterization will then be six cauterizations, and the heads should be of moderate size.
And this is the image of the cautery iron with three heads.
And this number may be increased by one, making eight cauterizations. Then, apply finely ground balls mixed with salt to the cauterization. Then, the patient must remain still and not move the limb for a while until it strengthens.  And if the dislocation is upwards, which is seldom the case.
Cauterize above the shoulder with one good, nail-shaped cauterization or many cauterizations in a dotted pattern; for the joint will strengthen, the moisture will leave, and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In cauterizing the stomach.
If coldness and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, deranging its temperament, and if many catarrhal discharges occur in it, and if it is treated with various remedies without success, then the patient should lie on his back with his legs and arms extended, and then three cauterizations should be performed. One cauterization should be performed below the pit of the stomach, the size of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery iron; and two cauterizations lower down, on either side of the first, so that the cauterizations form a triangle, and farther apart so that they do not join if they suppurate.  The depth of the cauterization should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and this should be the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery iron with which you perform this single cauterization should be circular, in this manner.
And the stomach may be cauterized by puncturing, for whoever is afraid of this cauterization. This is done by marking points on the stomach with ink to the desired extent, then cauterizing them with a punctate cautery iron, then treating it with the treatment previously described until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
In the cold cauterization of the liver.
If pain arises in the liver from coldness and dampness, or from a subtle wind, so that it has departed excessively from its natural temperament, and the patient has been treated with what we mentioned in the classification, but this has not been effective. Then the patient should lie on his back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink in this form and this exact amount on the liver below the ribs, where the human elbow ends.
And after each cauterization, a cauterization should be made of the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be straight along the body; and do not press down hard on the cautery iron.
And let the amount of skin thickness burned be half, no more. And let the patient stand on his feet; if he is not able to stand, let him lie down with his legs extended and his arms raised. And this is the image of the cautery iron.
And you may be able to cauterize these cauterizations with a knife-shaped cautery iron if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be careful lest you overdo the cauterization and burn all the skin, burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so know this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cauterizing a swelling of the liver.
If an abscess appears in the liver and you wish to know if that swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its peritoneum, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the peritoneum of the liver, there will be intense sharpness with the pain, and you see that the physicians have been exhausted in treating it, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire; it is the cautery that resembles a spatula, and this is its image. And cauterize it with one cauterization until you burn all the skin and the cauterization reaches the peritoneum until all the matter comes out, then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by one whose training in the art of medicine has been long and who has repeatedly experienced these diseases; then he may undertake such work, but leaving it is better in my opinion.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with the roots of rhubarb for cold fistulas in this manner: that you take one long, dry root of rhubarb, the longest you can find, and let it be about the thickness of a finger, then dip it in oil and heat it in the fire. Then cauterize with one cautery between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries a little below the jugular veins, slanting towards the side under the chin, and two large cauteries above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauteries also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slanting slightly backwards, and another cautery in the middle of the chest and another above the stomach, and three cauteries on the back: one between the shoulders and two on the sides of the spine, lower than the cautery which is between the shoulders.
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be superficially on the skin.  Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery like a file, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
And the pus comes out as we mentioned in the tumor of the liver.  In this method, cauterization is dangerous; either the patient dies immediately or a fistula forms in the place which will not heal.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have mentioned in the classification and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is in three ways, all of which are correct. One is to cauterize it three or four times, in a row, along the length of the spleen.
In the shape of the cauterizations of the liver, whose shape we have presented, and between each cauterization and cauterization is the width of a finger or a little more. The nature of the cautery is the same as we mentioned in the cauterization of the liver, and do not deepen your hand with the cauterization. The patient’s position is lying on his back.
The other method is in the elbow, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends, and your lifting of the skin is across the width of the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then you insert two cauteries, very carefully protected, until you pass them through the skin on the other side, then you remove the cautery so that the cauterizations are four. And if you wish, you may cauterize with the other cautery with three points.
Then you treat the place of cauterization after you leave it to discharge pus for many days; this is more effective than all the treatments mentioned before.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in particular for ascitic dropsy; if you treat the dropsical patient with the various treatments that we mentioned in the classification and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, and a cauterization on the spleen, and two cauterizations on his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
And do not deprive the patient of treatment after cauterization with what is necessary to gather the humors for him, so that healing may hasten to him.  The shape of the cautery with which the back is cauterized is nail-shaped, as its form has preceded. That with which the abdomen is cauterized is olive-shaped.
Chapter thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the top of the foot in the hollow between the little finger and the ring finger.
And place your hand with the cautery and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will ooze out, and the cautery is of this shape.
Then cauterize on the legs, two cauterizations on each leg, and the cauterization is done with the sharp end of the cautery; and the cauterization is along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below that towards the middle of the leg; and on each thigh, two cauterizations.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so that the water may ooze out, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter thirty-three.
Concerning the cauterization of diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and dampness, to the point of weakening the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments and it has not healed, and you see the patient able to withstand cauterization and strong, then cauterize him with a large cauterization on his stomach. As was previously explained in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery iron and four cauterizations around the navel with a gentle, nail-shaped cautery iron, and a large cauterization, or two, on the coccyx.
If you see that the dampness is abundant and the patient is able to withstand it, then cauterize him on the pubis and on each flank, and perhaps you can add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit is not missed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are chronic, numerous, or single hemorrhoids in the anus, and they are of thick, cold humors or corrupt dampness, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the section, but the treatment has not been effective, then cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the sacrum, slightly below the coccyx, in a triangular shape.
A cauterization below the navel, about two fingers' width; and if you estimate that his stomach has become cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as mentioned before, and a cauterization on his liver. And another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery iron; and leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, then heat the cautery iron which resembles a needle, then insert it, hot, into the same cut wart, and deepen your hand until the cautery iron reaches the mouth of the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, then cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with whatever ointments suit them until they heal; and if you cauterize a large area with cotton wool also, it will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On cauterizing the fistula which is in the anus and its vicinity.
If the patient does not consent to the incision and the procedure which we described in its place, and shrinks from that, then perhaps he will heal by cauterization.  If a fistula occurs in one place, and pus and corrupt humors flow from it for a long time, then the first thing you should do is to measure it with a thin probe.
Then ascertain its depth with the probe, then heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the fistula itself, along the course of the fistula and to the depth which the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt bodies are burnt, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And beware of burning a nerve, if there is one, or a large vein, if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.
Guard against all these places. You do this only if the fistula is in a fleshy place and you judge that it is not penetrating. Then treat the place until it heals. If the place closes and the matter ceases from it and remains so for a time, then know that it has completely healed.
And if the matter does not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that in its depth there is a decayed bone or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or a strong wind, and because of that the patient's strength diminishes, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the loins, over the kidneys themselves. Cauterize each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery which was previously mentioned.  And perhaps you should cauterize it a third time in the same session. Then three cauterizations in a row would be most effective.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder from cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it with one cauterization below the navel, over the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and one cauterization to the right of the navel and another to its left.
The distance after cauterization on each side should be the width of a thumb joint. And cauterize with one cauterization in the lower back, or two if needed. The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On cauterizing the womb.
If a substance from cold and dampness occurs in the womb, and because of that it is prevented from conception, and its discharge is spoiled, and its menstruation is difficult, or pain occurs to it upon its arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize three cauterizations around the navel, as we mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. And one cauterization on cotton in the lower back, or two, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Erroneous moist substances may settle in the hip joint, and be a cause for its dislocation.  Its sign is that the leg is longer than the other if one compares them to each other, and you will find emptiness in the place of the dislocation.  Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the hip joint itself, a semi-circular cauterization.
After you have drawn with ink around the joint, as it rotates so that the joint itself falls in the middle of the circle. The cautery, whose image is presented in cauterizing the stomach, should be used. If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize with three cauterizations using the large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization as deep as the entire thickness of the skin, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter forty-one.
In cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint and its cause is cold and dampness, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the division, and the treatment has not been effective, and it has lasted for a long time, then it is necessary to evacuate the thick humors from the patient with the foul-smelling bean or the prickly pear bean, or something similar.
Then shave it and apply the cautery in two ways: either cautery with burning medicines or cautery with fire. Cautery with fire is done in many ways; one of them is to cauterize on the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
Make them of a suitable depth, and the distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger. The cautery iron should be olive-shaped.  One may also cauterize a single cauterization in the middle, on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations. If you wish, shave it in the circle previously mentioned in the cauterization of hip dislocation, a single cauterization.
So that the circle encompasses the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin. This is the description of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two cauterizations on the thigh at the place where the patient indicates pain, and one cauterization above the malleolus, four fingers towards the lateral side slightly. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicates with a pointed cautery iron three or four times, or more if necessary. If he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to cauterize to the point of burning a nerve or a large artery, lest you thereby cause the patient a bad or lasting harm.
And I have seen one and another who was cauterized above the malleolus, and the cauterization was excessive, so the leg became gangrenous until the gangrene reached the foot and perforated it entirely, and the whole leg was corrupted, and then diarrhea and death followed. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize both in the same manner.
Some learned physicians have mentioned concerning the cauterization of the hip a cauterization of this description:  A cup-like instrument is made of iron, its diameter being half a span, and its mouth the thickness of a date pit or slightly less, and inside this cup another cup, and a third cup.
And the distance between each cup will be the width of a thumb's joint, and the cups will be open on both sides, and their height will be about one or two finger joints, and a handle of well-secured iron is made for them. And this is its image.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then it is placed on the hip joint, the patient leaning on the sound side, and three round cauterizations are made at once, then it is left for three days and dressed with butter, and the wound is left open for several days.
Many, then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The author of this book said: We have rarely used this type of cauterization because of its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, and because of the few whom we find who can endure it, except that it is among the good cauterizations for those who endure it and its application is appropriate.
As for cauterization with burning drugs, it is that you make two cups similar to the rings through which the pulp of the pomegranate passes, of copper or iron.
Their rims will have a height of about two finger joints or so, and the distance between them will be the thickness of a finger, and they will be open at the bottom and open at the top, and some of them will be held together in this manner.
Then you lower them onto the hip joint, the patient lying on his sound side, and you firmly hold your hand, then you pour between the two circles some sharp water, which is slightly warmed by the fire, and hold it for the duration of an hourglass, and the patient endures its stinging and burning, for he will feel a burning like fire.
Until the burning subsides, then you raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the sharp water from the entire hip with fresh water, then you leave it for three days and apply butter to it until the blackness of the burn disappears, and you leave it for days so that pus flows from it, for that is more effective.
Then you treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, you make a mold for it that holds water, in the same way you made it for the hip. This is the description of the sharp water, and I have described it in the chapter on the preparation of medicines.
Take one part of alkali salt and one part of unslaked lime, crush them, and put them in a new pot that has a single small hole in its bottom, just large enough for a gimlet to enter.  Place another glazed pot under the bottom of the pot.
And pour enough fresh water onto the alkali and lime to cover them by a finger's breadth, after having firmly pressed them with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water drips into the glazed pot below. Then collect all that water, and pour it onto more fresh lime and alkali.
Then it will be extremely sharp, useful in many medical procedures and for cauterizing various limbs, because it acts just like fire.  There are also other medications that cauterize the hip, such as thapsia, honey of spurge, and lime with soap, mixed together.
Galen claimed, recounting a story from the ancients, a treatment for hip pain and sciatica, greatly emphasizing its importance, and claiming that it requires no other treatment and cures in a single application.
To the point that one might enter the bath carried and leave cured. This is done by taking green borage—if green is not available, take fresh dry borage—finely grinding it with some fat, and applying it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg, or to the thigh.
It is bandaged and left for three hours, or however long the patient feels the burning subsides. Then he is put in the bath. When his body is damp, he is put in the tub. Then, God willing, the pain will leave and he will be cured. If not cured, repeat the application after ten days.
Then, God willing, he will be cured. Know that one should not cauterize with these medications except after purging the body. Dioscorides mentioned that goat hair, when used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization is done in this manner: wool is taken and soaked in old oil and placed on the deep place between the thumb of the hand and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat hair.
Heat it with fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Then take another, and continue doing this until sensation reaches from the middle of the arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing.  This type of cauterization is called goat-hair cauterization.
Chapter forty-two.
Concerning cauterization of back pain.
Pain in the back may occur from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like.  It is caused by the effusion of a cold, moist substance, and cauterization is only performed in this type alone.
That which is from the effusion of a cold substance, then after the patient has vomited with the use of *ḥibb al-munta*n and the like, he should be cauterized on his back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the table itself, after marking the location with ink. In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to what you see the patient can tolerate and his strength.
And the cauterization should be with a needle cautery; and if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizations with a medium-sized nail cautery in this manner.
Chapter forty-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This ailment often affects young children, and its initial sign in a child is that he experiences shortness of breath upon standing and movement, and you find at the end of his spinal vertebrae a bead that has protruded, standing out from the other beads.
If you see that and want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery in this manner. Let the cautery take on each side of the vertebra evenly; and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a punctate cautery in two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another.  Then treat the area until it heals as we have mentioned.
And take care not to use cautery in a hump that is from a spasm of the nerve.
Chapter forty-four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If the joint pains are from cold humors that descend to any member of the body, then if the pains occur in the legs, it is customary for physicians to call that gout especially.
If the gout, whose cause is cold, is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification, and the pains do not go away, then cautery removes them.  This is to cauterize it, after evacuation, around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations. The cautery iron should be medium-sized and olive-shaped, in this manner.
And if you need to punctuate the surface of the leg, do so with a punctate cautery iron. If the pains ascend to the knees or to the other joints—and this often happens—then cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery iron.
If you need more cauterization than this, cauterize, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery; rather, it should be only to the thickness of the skin. If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, then use what we mentioned concerning cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, punctuate around the forearms as if circling two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, punctuate each joint with a point and the metacarpus. If the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders,
cauterize them on each side.  The patient should not be without good management and the taking of medicines, for if he improves his diet and evacuates the phlegm, he will recover with this cautery, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestines and fat descend to the testicle, and this is recent and early, then you should order the patient to abstain from food that day and to use laxatives which will move the stool from his bowels.
Then he should lie on his back before you, and you should order him to strain himself until the fat or intestines protrude, then you should return it with your finger.  Then you should mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a semicircle, its ends towards the upper part of the body.
Then heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or fat to the abdomen. Then let an assistant place his hand on the spot lest the intestine protrude. And you have spread the patient's legs apart and placed a cushion under him, and another assistant ties his legs.
And another on his chest holds his hands. Then lower the cautery onto the same mark, your hand holding the cautery upright and steady, and hold it until it reaches the bone, or repeat it another time if it does not reach the bone the first time.
And take care to prevent the intestine from protruding while you cauterize, lest you burn it, which would cause the patient either death or a great calamity. And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed.  And the cautery should be gentle for children according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with fat, until the scab from the fire is gone. Then treat it with other ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound closes.
And you should make his diet during his treatment such that it softens his bowels, lest the intestine protrude during defecation. Then, if he wants to get up after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days. And he should reduce exertion, overeating and drinking, and loud shouting.
For if this treatment is used in this way, he will be completely healed, God willing. And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing. As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is recent, if you wish to prevent it from increasing, cauterize the hernia with a round cautery of its size. Let what you burn of the skin be about two-thirds of it. Then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing.  Some of the ancients mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After you mark the hernia with ink, making a horizontal line at the upper side of the hernia and another line downwards, and you place a single, nail-like cautery in the middle. The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If pain occurs in some part of the body due to a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time and is not relieved by medication, then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery. The cauterization of each member should be according to its size, smallness, weakness and strength.
And if the pain and fistula persist, then if it heals from the first cauterization, that is good; otherwise repeat the cauterization.  For it is the nature of these pains to spread from one member to what is near it, therefore you should follow it with cauterization until the patient recovers.
Chapter forty-seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy which is caused by corruption of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize, consider: if the leprosy is incipient and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification, and it has not abated nor stopped, and you fear that corruption will overwhelm the patient's entire constitution, then cauterize the head with five cauterizations. One in the middle of the head as is customary, the second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, and two on the temples, and one at the back on the hollow of the nape.  And exert yourself a little with the cautery until it slightly affects the bone.
And scales will be removed from it, so that the thick vapors may more easily escape. Cauterize also the spleen in the same manner as before. But if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and become clearly manifest, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauterizations which we have mentioned on the head. And a cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on the cheeks, and two cauterizations on the cervical vertebrae, and six on the dorsal vertebrae, and a large one on the coccyx at the base of the spine, and another above it in the same area, and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on the knees, one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts, and cauterize each joint of the fingers and toes with one cauterization, and each heel of his feet and the forearms.
And be careful of the nerve which is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them.  And a cauterization may be done on the pubic bone, and another on the stomach, and another on the liver. And know that the more cauterizations you do, the more beneficial and effective it will be.
And know that the patient does not feel the pain of cauterization as the healthy person does, because his body is numb. And the cauteries should be large and small according to the members and joints, as previously described in the descriptions of the cauteries.
Then treat the cauterization with crushed acorns mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness: when a limb becomes numb and is treated with medicines, ointments, and bandages, but does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to what the size of the limb deserves, whether large or small. And let your cauterization penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  And it may be that some numbness that occurs in the hand and foot in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb is cauterized, and the numbness will go away.
And let no one undertake this except one who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of vitiligo.
If vitiligo becomes chronic and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it slightly, to the depth of the skin's thickness, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour mixed with rose oil, lamb's tongue, and pigeon's blood or partridge's blood—one part of each. Mix everything, apply it to a cloth, and bind it to the area until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is incipient and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it grows. Some wise men have mentioned cauterizing it intensely in its center, but I do not recommend this, because I expect it to ulcerate, and I have witnessed this many times.
It is correct to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many cauterizations.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of hemorrhoids.
If a hemorrhoid develops and is slow to mature, either because of the causative factor, or because of the patient's age if he is elderly and anemic, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the hemorrhoid, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, puncturing it.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation. If you wish to cauterize it, take the cautery whose image is this.
And insert it into the middle of the hemorrhoid until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be from what is below, so that the pus may easily flow, then treat it as it should be treated until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two.
On cauterizing the chancre.
A chancre is nothing but a corruption that spreads in the member and eats it, just as fire eats dry wood. If you see a chancre in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, take many small and large, nail-like cauteries, according to what suits that place where the chancre is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days and apply to the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil until all the eschar and all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with ointments that grow flesh. If you see after three days that the flesh grows healthy flesh without corruption, otherwise repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas. And you may treat the chancre with caustic medicine.
For it acts in place of fire, more quickly beneficial. And I have mentioned its treatment with caustic medicine in the classification, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This condition frequently occurs on the soles of the feet; it is a rough thing that pains the person.  Cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with caustic water.
As for cauterization with fire, you heat a hollow cautery iron resembling an eagle's feather, made of iron, to the extent that it surrounds the nail from every side, and let its edge be thin. Then you lower it, hot, onto the nail, and then turn your hand with the iron around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail.
And you leave it three days, it will suppurate, then you dress it with pounded wild lettuce mixed with salt and leave the dressing on it overnight; then it will be extracted from its roots.  Then treat the wound site with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals, if the nails are not inverted.
This frequently occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet.  It is necessary that you take a tube of copper or iron or an eagle's feather and lower it onto the nail or wart, then pour a little caustic water into the tube.
And hold your hand as you turn it, slightly pricking with your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the root of the nail, and the caustic water finds a way to penetrate to the root of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging of the caustic water for a short time.
Then leave it, for the nail will be extracted by its roots. Do this one by one until you have treated all of them on the body. Then treat their locations after they are extracted with ointments that grow flesh.
Chapter fifty-four.
On cauterization with a cautery.
If someone suffers from a convulsion due to a cold in the nerve, or from a quartan fever or something else, then you should cauterize him four or five times on the vertebrae of the back, with one cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on his chest. And on his stomach a cauterization with the olive-shaped cautery iron, for the convulsion will cease and the cold illness will quickly mature.
Chapter fifty-five.
On cauterizing boils that occur in the body.
Ugly boils may erupt in the body, arising from cold, thick, corrupt substances.  At their first appearance, each boil should be gently cauterized on its head with a reed whose tip has been ignited in the fire, or with a long cautery iron, or with a lentil-shaped cautery iron.
And abscesses may be cauterized at their first eruption in this manner; the active cause of the ailment will not increase and will dissipate, and the patient will recover, except that this should be done after the patient has been bled.
Chapter fifty-six.
On cauterizing the bleeding that occurs when an artery is cut.
Often bleeding from a severed artery occurs from an external wound, or from the incision of a tumor, or the cauterization of a member, and the like, making it difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press firmly to contain the blood beneath your finger so that nothing escapes. Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and heat them until they are very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery has burst, and apply the cautery to the same vessel after quickly removing your finger, holding the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If, upon removing your finger from the mouth of the artery, the bleeding resumes and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire and continue to do this, one after another, until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve, lest you cause further harm to the patient. Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. For if it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop; or it may be tightly bound with threads; or medications that stop bleeding may be applied, and the wound tightly bound with bandages.
But whoever tries to stop it with a ligature, or by tightening with rags, or by applying cauterizing agents, and so on, will not succeed in stopping it except rarely.  If this happens to someone and a physician or medicine is not available, he should quickly place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
He should press very hard until the bleeding is contained and flows from above the wound and onto the artery.  The finger should not be removed, and it should be constantly cooled with very cold water until the blood clots, thickens, and stops.  During this time, consider what is needed, whether cauterization or medication.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, punctures, bloodletting, wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: In the first chapter, we mentioned every disease for which cauterization with fire and cauterizing medication are suitable, along with their causes, reasons, instruments, the forms of cauteries, and we made that into chapters, from head to foot.
And I follow the same path in this chapter, so that the student may easily find what he seeks.
Before I begin, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more pitfalls than the first chapter on cauterization.
Therefore, caution should be greater in this chapter, because the work in this chapter frequently involves the loss of blood which sustains life, when opening a vein, or incising a tumor, or lancing an abscess, or treating a wound, or removing an arrow, or incising a stone, and the like; all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most of them death occurs.
And I advise you to avoid that which is dubious, for various kinds of people may come to you in this profession with various kinds of illnesses; some of whom may be weary of their illness and death has become easy for them.
Because of the severity of their illness, and the length of their affliction, and in the illness is that which indicates death.  And some of them will give you their wealth and enrich you with it hoping for health, and their illness is deadly; therefore you should absolutely not assist anyone of this description who comes to you.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything of this unless after certain knowledge that is confirmed for you as to what the favorable outcome will be.  And in all the treatment of your patients, use foreknowledge and warning as to what leads to safety.
For in that you will have aid in acquiring praise, glory, mention and thanks. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance and may He not deprive you of correctness and success; indeed that is in His hand, there is no god but He.
And I have arranged this chapter in sections, as preceded in the chapter on cautery, from head to foot, so that what you want from it may be easier for you, God willing.
The first chapter.
In the treatment of the water which collects in the heads of infants.
This ailment frequently affects infants at birth if the midwife presses the infant's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from a hidden cause which is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone except infants, and all those I have seen of them have died quickly; therefore I have seen it abandoned. And I have seen an infant whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger every day. Until the infant could not sit up because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture either gathers between the skin and the bone, or it gathers under the bone on the dura mater.  The procedure in this, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, is that one should make a single transverse incision in the middle of the head, and the length of the incision should be about two fingerbreadths, so that the moisture flows out. This is the image of the scalpel.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make two intersecting incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone—and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side and the water sinks down if you press it with your hand inwards, and this is not hidden from you—then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
And after the incision, all the moisture comes out, then you bind the incisions with cloths and bandages, then you anoint it from above with syrup and oil until the fifth day, then you loosen the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments, and do not leave off binding the head moderately, and nourish the patient with every dry food with little moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals. Another description of the incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling and the gathering of water appear, for it may be in the back of the head more, or in its front, or on the right, or on the left.
Then you aim with the incision where the swelling and the fullness of water appeared to you, so you incise it as you can, and be careful not to cut a vein, lest bleeding occur and the patient die from that bleeding along with the evacuation of the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears known as the mastoid arteries.
When someone is afflicted with acute catarrh in the eyes or chest, and this is prolonged and treatment with medicines does not work, then the best treatment in that case is to cut these two arteries.
So if you want to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears, then tie the patient's neck with a piece of his garment, then look where the pulse beats and their positions, the two lower positions behind the ears, and they rarely hide except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with a sharp scalpel, cutting to the bone, and this should be across the head. And if you wish, insert the scalpel from under the artery and cut upwards, and the length of the cut should be about two fingers breadth.
If the artery is cut, the blood will come out in a pulsating flow, leaping forward repeatedly. If the artery is not palpable, then you should measure three fingers' breadth from the ear, then mark it with ink and incise to the bone.  What should be...
...sent from the blood six ounces on average, and perhaps more or less, all this depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his arteries.  Then look at the wound; if there remains any peritoneum on the bone, cut it away.
lest a hot swelling occur. Then bind the wound with a linen thread, and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Incision of the two arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic migraine or acute attacks caused by sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache and the like, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, then we have tried in these diseases incision of the arteries of the temples or their cauterization, as we have described.
The procedure for their incision is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the artery visible in the temple should be targeted, for it will be apparent to you from its pulse, and it rarely hides except in a few people.
Or, in severe cold, if it is hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with the excess of his garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or compress the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly and obviously. Then take the scalpel, whose image is this. Then you incise the skin gently with it until you reach the artery, then you put a hook into it and pull it upwards until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on every side; and if the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook. Then cut off a portion of it according to how far apart its ends are and contract, and do not cause bleeding; for if it is not severed and cut, the blood will not flow at all. Then evacuate from six to three ounces of blood.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread, and let the thread be either of silk or of lute strings, lest putrefaction quickly reach it before the wound heals, and bleeding occurs.
Then cut what is between the ligatures; do this at that time or after another time. And if you wish to cauterize it with a knife-like cautery to the bone until its ends are severed, it will take the place of this same operation or be better, as we said.
Unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, because cauterization is something that helps to consume humors, and so it is more certain in benefit. After ligating the arteries, it is necessary that the place be packed with worn cotton and firm pledgets be placed on it; and after healing, it should be treated with dry medicines which generate flesh, and with bandages, until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your operation, hasten to cut it, either by cauterization or by filling the place with alum and tightening your hand until the blood stops. If you do not have any of that, put your finger there until the blood clots.
And wash the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides and tighten it as necessary.  What is easier and simpler than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the two places with ink.
And lower it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed in two places so that its ends are separated, for it will not reunite with this cauterization at all.  And this is the image of the cautery.
The blades should be sharp, resembling small scalpels, except that they should be much less sharp than a scalpel, because if they are as sharp as a scalpel, the cold reaches them more quickly and the flesh is not severed quickly. If they have some thickness, the heat of the fire will be retained in them.
And the flesh is severed quickly. This procedure is better than any other procedure, and is lighter and easier. Let the distance between the blades be the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
In the treatment of the constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins on the scalp from the outside, and nothing from the treatment of medicine has benefited, and you see the patient's face has reddened. And he feels in his forehead a tingling like the tingling of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their eyelids having been corroded and their lids clinging together from the intensity of the tears.  Therefore, the ancients in treating it resorted to this procedure, and they call it treatment with the sword. It is that you order the patient to have the hair shaved from his forehead.
Then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead. The length of each incision is about two fingers, one incision parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the joining of the jaws.  The distance between each incision should be about three closed fingers. And have with you prepared pieces of sponge or many dry cloths to wipe the blood.
Then you insert the double-edged scalpel, whose image is this. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, and with it you dissect all the skin between the two incisions together with the membrane on the bone. Then you do that also from the middle incision to the third incision, then you remove this scalpel. And you also insert into the first incision another instrument called a sharp, one-sided knife, smooth and not sharp on the other side, and this is its image:.
And you place its sharp side upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone, and you push it until it reaches the middle incision, and you cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then you do that in the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, you squeeze the areas of clotted blood, then you place in each incision a pledget of cotton, and you place over it a compress moistened with syrup and oil, or vinegar and oil.
Lest a hot swelling occur, and on the third day you untie the bandage and use much washing with lukewarm water, then you treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and all that you treat wounds with until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When someone has frequent, sharp, severe, persistent discharges, and you see his eyes weak, small, and his vision weakened, and the eyelids ulcerated and the eyelashes falling out. And there is a sharp, painful ache in the depth of the head, and continuous sneezing; then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins, and the best treatment in them is this treatment: that you order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is a sharp, painful ache in the depth of the head, and continuous sneezing; then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins, and the best treatment in them is this treatment: that you order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or a little higher transversely, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be to the bone, and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples which move when chewing, until the bone is exposed and all the blood is dried with a sponge.
Then separate the lips of the incision with worn cotton or a linen thread, then bandage from above with pledgets, and soak the pledgets with syrup and oil, lest a hot inflammation occur. And when you unwrap it and see that the hot inflammation has subsided, then it is necessary to scrape the bone until the growth of flesh begins in it.
Then treat it with the drying treatment which causes flesh to grow, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and preparing an ointment from them, and using it for the growth of flesh in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or something like stone such as iron and glass; or a plant seed like chickpea and kernel and the like; or a flowing thing like water and vinegar and the like.
Or an animal.  When a stone or a kind of stone falls into the ear which does not grow in the ear, then expose the ear to the sun. Then if you see the stone, instill some violet oil or ceruse into it, then try to remove it by movement of the head or sneezing with a sneeze-inducing agent. And block the nostrils at the time of sneezing, after placing a ring of rags or wool around the ear and extending the ear upwards. Often it comes out with this treatment.  If it does not come out, then try to remove it with a gentle curette, whose image is this.
If it comes out with the curette, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly curved, blind probe. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear gently.
And seal what is around the tube with pitch softened with oil, lest there be a path for the air other than the tube. Then draw it with your breath strongly, and often it comes out by this. If it does not come out by what we described, then take a little of the gum of Nabataea or of the prepared gum with which birds are caught, and put it on the tip of the probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, then insert it into the opening of the ear gently after drying the ear from moisture. If it does not come out by all that we described, then proceed to incision before hot swelling or tension occurs.
The method of incision is that you first bleed the patient in the temple and let out blood according to his strength. Then you sit the patient before you, turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lobe, in its lowest part.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Then quickly stitch the incision and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, then try to remove it as we mentioned. If it does not respond to removal, then take a thin, delicate scalpel like this.
And try with it to cut that type of seed that has fallen into the ear.  You do this only if you are certain that the seed has become moistened by the vapor of the ear until it becomes many small pieces, then remove them with a blind probe or with a delicate sponge or by suction.
As we mentioned, then it is easy to remove them. As for water entering the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore, having filled his ear with some old cotton while lying on the ear that contains the water. If it comes out with that,
otherwise, take many small, smooth, flat stones the length of the fingers, warm them slightly by the fire, and let the patient insert one into the opening of his ear, then he should stand on one leg on that side and strike the stone in the ear with another stone.
He continues to do this with stone after stone until all the water comes out. The water may also come out by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear and bringing the other end to the fire until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out, or draw it out with a tube as was mentioned previously for the stone. As for removing an animal that has entered, see if it is small, like a flea or similar; treat it as described in the section, but if...
if its body is large and perceptible to the touch, try to remove it with lint and hooks; this is easier than anything else that gets into the ear.  As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you treat it with what we mentioned in the section on instillations and your treatment is not effective,
you should look into the ear in the sun; if you see any worms, remove them with lint or fine hooks. If you see nothing, take a tube of this shape.
narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate. Then suck strongly; do this repeatedly until all the worms come out. If they do not come out, seal around the tube with wax as I described for the stone.
If they do not come out by the methods mentioned, use the instillations that I have described and which the ancients used to kill worms; you will find this in the section on instillations.  Pouring oils and medicines into the ear should be done with this instrument, and this is its image:
As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top. If you wish, the nozzle inside the tube can be made of tightly fitting copper; if you wish, you can take a reed and wrap cotton tightly around its end.
Then pour the oil, juice, or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear, then insert the reed with the cotton from above and squeeze it gently with your hand until the oil is forced into the ear and is felt.
by the patient, and let what you pour into the ear be warmed slightly in the fire.  Beware of pouring anything into it that is very cold or very hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of accidental blockage of the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear openings not perforated.
It may also happen that some people experience a blockage in the ear canal from a wound or from newly grown flesh; and this blockage may be deep within the ear opening, invisible to the eye.
It may also appear slightly outside the opening and be visible to the eye. That which appears deep within the ear and is not visible to the eye is, in most cases, difficult to cure; but that which is visible to the eye should have the patient's ear exposed to the sun. And look into it; if you see the blockage, open it with a delicate scalpel, which is of this form:.
Its tip should be somewhat broad, and limited on one side, while the rest of the scalpel is smooth on both sides, lest it injure the ear. If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently but firmly until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe, warm it slightly in the fire, and insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage, and the patient feels a heaviness in hearing, remove it gently.
Be careful not to injure the eardrum. Then insert into the ear a wick the size of the opening, having smeared it with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are certain the wound will not close up. Or take a wick and moisten it with water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
And use it. If you see that the ear has swollen with a hot inflammation, then it is necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another wick smeared with a poultice made with rose oil, until the hot inflammation subsides. Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear.  And use the other treatments which stop bleeding, mentioned in the chapter on styptics.
Chapter Eight.
In the treatment of warts which appear on the eyelids.
These warts which appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry. It is necessary to grasp them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel, then apply powdered verdigris to the area.
If they bleed, cauterize them with a mild lentil-shaped cautery. Cauterization is best after cutting. They often return if some of their roots remain; if cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter Nine.
In the treatment of the cold which affects the eyelids.
Often something resembling a cold in its intensity and hardness appears in the eyelids.
Therefore it is called a cold, which is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  The treatment is to examine it; if the cold swelling is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves in every direction, then its treatment is easy, so make a transverse incision on it.
Then carefully peel it from every side until it is released, then hang it with a hook and cut it. If you cannot cut it except after it has passed through the eyelid, that will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, join it with sutures and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no harm from it, for the ointment will heal and join it. If the cold swelling is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn back the eyelid and hang the cold swelling with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it from every side.
If it penetrates the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the cold swelling with salt water and treat the area with what joins until the patient heals.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of the wen which appears in the eyelid.
The wen is a fleshy lump that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid.  This most often affects children, weighing down their eyes and causing them to suffer from colds at night; they are unable to look at sunlight. Because the tears flow quickly to them.
Therefore you see them always leaning on their faces, and on them they sleep, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, swollen, and the wen is clearly visible. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the wen between them. The method of treatment is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick of a size that encompasses the wen on every side, then place it on the wen and press with your fingers from every side to gather the wen in the middle of the circle.
Then you make an incision in the middle of that swelling with a lancet, a horizontal incision, and the incision should not be larger than the incision made in bloodletting. As for the depth, you should cut all the skin until you reach the wen.
Then, in most cases, the wen protrudes from the incision in the form of a white piece of fat. You pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers, while you turn your hand right and left until it is completely removed. Be careful not to increase the incision, lest the lancet reach the eye and injure it.
If the wen does not appear in the first incision, you should increase the incision slightly gently until the wen appears, then pull it out as we said. Then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bind it with a bandage. Some people crush salt.
And they place it in the cavity of the incision to dissolve what remains of that swelling. Then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eyelid surgery.
If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid, outside the normal course, under the normal eyelashes and brows, they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, white spots, and thickening, to the point that it causes blindness.
Eyelid surgery is performed in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or by strong medication as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or by excision and suturing, or by the reed, as I shall describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it does not turn, then insert a needle with a thread from beneath the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread from above, near the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
Turn it with a probe, then incise inside the eyelid, below the extra hair, with a lancet from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus; then remove the thread and place a small pledget of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, then mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a laurel leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to raise the eyelid, because people differ in this; some need a portion of the eyelid cut according to how much the eyelid has relaxed.
And some need less to be cut, all according to the relaxation of the eyelid. Then incise with the lancet along the two lines which you have marked, beginning from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and let each incision be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one corner of the skin, then flay it all, then unite the lips with suture using a needle and fine woolen thread, wipe away the blood, and stick what remains of the threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
If you wish to do that, otherwise it does not matter. Then leave the sutures and threads for about three or four days, then treat it.  And if you wish, leave the wound without suturing and treat it with things that dry and constrict, for the eyelid will rise when the wound is closed and healed; and suturing is better.
This method of blepharoplasty was mentioned by the ancients, although it is burdensome for the patient; it is a good procedure and there is no danger in it. Another method of blepharoplasty is to mark on the eyelid a shape like that of a laurel leaf, as we have described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or grouped in this manner:.
Then cut off the excess eyelid with small scissors, in this manner, in even cuts.
If you cannot hold the hooks and they do not straighten for you, then take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger canthus and a third thread near the smaller canthus, and gather the threads together with your fingers evenly, then raise it with a moderate lift.
Raise all the marked skin as we have described, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If a hot inflammation appears when you cut or incise, then soothe that inflammation with qirūṭī and similar soothing ointments.
It may also happen to the lower eyelid that its edges turn in, so you should use what we have mentioned of cutting and suturing and cauterization with fire and with caustic medication; cauterization with fire or with caustic medication is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing, and you should perform cutting and suturing in both.
Cauterization with a reed is done in this way: you turn the eyelid and make an incision on the inside as described, then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And you have cut into their ends on both sides where the threads are grasped, then gently bring them together on what remains of the eyelid and tightly pull the two reeds from both sides and leave it for some days, for the stretched skin dies, turns black and decays.
Until it falls off by itself; if it is slow, cut it off with scissors, then treat it until it heals.  When it heals, the eyelid will be raised and the edges of the eyelids will not be inverted. This is an image of the two reeds, make them in this shape and this size in length and width exactly:
Chapter Twelve.
On raising an inverted eyelash from the eye with a needle.
If it is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle, thread it with a fine, smooth silk thread, then bring the two ends together and tie them in a very gentle knot, and let the length of the thread be about a span.
Then attach another thin thread to the needle, shorter than the first, and tie its ends if you wish. Then have the patient place their head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the work may be clearly seen, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the superfluous hair.
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair. Then pull the thread upward with the needle and draw into the needle that hair, whether it be one, two, or three, but no more.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out with the needle in the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pull the needle and the hair does not come out with it, pull the needle downwards with the thread you attached to it until the needle comes out of the upper opening.
Then return the hair into it and pull them; do this until it rises into the upper opening and you see it clearly. Then remove the needle and thread and pull them out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days until the hair settles in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add to it a long hair from the natural hair so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a time, then lift it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the stye that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The stye which is exposed to this is called a hare’s eye, and this stye is either natural or accidental.  The accidental one is from the healing of a wound or incision or cauterization, and so on.
And the way to work in it is to incise that scar tissue and separate its lips, and place a wick of linen between them and tie it until it heals.  And it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things which dry and constrict.
For if you do that, the stye will return more severely than it was. Rather, use in it things which relax, such as fenugreek and lint with water in which alkanet and flaxseed have been boiled, and diachylon ointment dissolved with something of the fats, and smear the wick with it and treat it with this.
And the principle of its treatment is that you strive by every means that it does not unite in the way it was initially. And this work which we have mentioned is only some improvement of the stye, not that the appearance of the place returns to what it was at all.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the treatment of the stye which forms in the lower eyelid.
This stye which forms in the lower eyelid is that which is truly called a stye, and it is natural and it is accidental. The accidental one is from a wound or incision or cauterization and the like.
And the method of working in it is that you take a needle with a doubled thread and you pierce it into the flesh and pass it from the left canthus to the right canthus until the thread is at the edges of the flesh, then you stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
Then if the shape of the eyelid returns to what is proper, otherwise you take a probe and place it on the site of the incision and turn the eyelid with it and make two incisions in the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the two incisions are from the corners of the cut which you cut until they meet and a corner is formed from them. Until when they meet, its shape becomes similar to this shape:
And it is the Greek letter lambda, then you remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp side is below what is next to the eyelid, then you gather the separated parts with two stitches, sewing it with a wool thread, then you treat it with what we mentioned of emollient and relaxing medicines until it heals.
And if the fistula appeared from an incision or suture or cauterization, it is necessary that you make a simple incision without the hair of the labia as well, as mentioned before, then separate between the lips with a probe as we mentioned.
In short, in the treatment of fistula, whether it is from above or below, you should work according to what is available to you from the form of the fistula, for it may differ greatly in appearance, and the skillful surgeon devises a way in whatever manner is possible for him.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approximates it, and the disease itself indicates to you what is suitable for it in terms of treatment and instrument in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
This adhesion may occur to many people, such that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing it from easy movement and hindering its natural functions.  It is necessary to insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not with the sharpness of cutting scalpels, but rather slightly dull, lest the patient be disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slip, harming the eye with its sharpness.  Your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed, then pour into the eye salty water to wash it, or instill into it some solution of vitriol dissolved in water, then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen pledget.
And place over the eye wool moistened with egg white, and after the third day use the astringent eye drops until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
In the cutting of the pterygium and the fleshy excrescence of the conjunctiva.
The pterygium is of two types: either nervous, resembling a firm, thin membrane; or non-nervous, resembling a thick, white moisture; if touched by iron, or if one attempts to take it with a hook, it is torn.
And a hook does not take hold of it. Both types begin from the greater canthus until they spread little by little until they cover the pupil and prevent light and the movement of the eye. The method of cutting it is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and stretch it upwards, then you take a needle and insert into it a horsehair or oxhair and strong thread, and you bend the tip of the needle slightly and pierce it into the middle of the pterygium.
And you pass it through with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and stretch it upwards and dissect with the hair the side of the pterygium which is next to the pupil, as if you are spreading it with the hair to its end, then you cut the remainder at the root of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the canthus.
Lest there result from its cutting a constant flow of tears.  The pterygium may be stretched with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, then the smooth scalpel dissects the end, the image of which is this:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, lest it cause a wound and injure the pupil. Then after the cutting, place in the eye some powdered salt or some collyrium of vitriol and leave it until the next day, then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fibrous and you are unable to insert a needle into it or fix a hook in it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and heals as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
And take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, in this manner: And dissect the pterygium from above gently with it. If you see that it loosens and disintegrates and the dissection has taken effect, then immediately instill in the eye some collyrium of vitriol or red collyrium or powdered salt, and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot inflammation intervenes in the eye; in that case, leave it and treat the hot inflammation until it heals, then resume the dissection until it heals. As for the fleshy excrescence of the caruncle…
If the excrescence causes excessive harm to the eye, then hook that excrescence with a hook and cut some of it off, but do not overdo the cutting lest it cause epiphora. Then instill in the caruncle red or vitriol collyrium until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
Concerning the excision of the pterygium and what grows of excessive flesh in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, a red fleshy growth may develop, so that it covers the pupil, or comes near to it, or overflows onto the eyelids; and sometimes the eyelids turn outwards, and it resembles a rose-flower.
The procedure is that the patient should place his head in your lap, then open his eyes, and you should seize all that red flesh with hooks suitable for that purpose.
Or grasp it with forceps or a small hook; then cut the flesh, piece by piece, until you have removed it all by cutting, and take care of the eye, lest you injure it during the operation; and your cutting should be either with the scalpel which we described in the excision of the pterygium, or with small scissors. Like those with which one plucks hairs, as their picture appears in the chapter following this one.
When you have finished cutting and all the growth is gone, fill the eye with powdered alum, or drop into it some red vitriol or some other such corrosive medicine, and apply externally to the eye a pledget of lint with white of egg, to prevent hot inflammation.
If some of the growth remains and the bleeding overcomes you, and you fear hot inflammation, then leave the eye and treat it with remedies to allay the inflammation, and then return to the operation until it heals; and do likewise with the excess flesh which occurs in the eye of this kind.
But you should avoid treating any eye weak by nature or by accident, by means of the iron; and do not undertake any of these operations until you see that the organ can bear the operation.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the removal of pterygia from the eye.
Pterygia are red vessels which grow over the eye, hindering its function and weakening it with the passage of time.  First you should look: if the eye in which the pterygia is present is strong and has no other disease besides the pterygia,
then the removal is performed as follows: you should order the patient to place his head in your lap, then you should hook those vessels with one or two hooks, according to your skill. The hooks should be delicately curved in this manner:
Or they may be two double hooks in one body, in this manner:
Then, with a delicate pair of scissors, gently pick up those vessels and wipe away the blood from time to time until you see that those vessels have been removed from the eye and the bleeding has stopped.  Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done midday, facing the sun.
And be very careful in your work, lest you cut anything other than those vessels. When you have finished, instill in the eye green or red vitriol, so that its sharpness may consume what remains of the pterygium. If you cannot remove it all at that time, then bandage the eye with something that will soothe the pain.
And leave it for several days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is safe, then repeat the operation in the same manner until it is healed. This is the image of the appropriate scissors.
And leave it [and let the patient's head be on the pupil's lap, and another wipes away the tears and checks the front and back of the eye, and you] the principle in the operation is to open the eye with fixed or triangular speculums held by a pupil.
Sharp, and let the patient's head be on the pupil's lap, and another wipes away the tears and checks the front and back of the eye, and you have the choice to begin picking from the top of the eye or from the bottom, and it is preferable to cauterize two points on the upper side, one at the end of the ciliary body and the other at its beginning.
And grasp it between the middle finger and the index finger, then hook hooks from below opposite them, then grasp it between the little finger and the ring finger, and lift your hand gently until you see all of the pterygium raised; cut it from the smaller side if you wish with scissors, and if you wish with a delicate scalpel.
And insert the thread onto a needle and scrape away all of the pterygium until it is raised above the conjunctiva, and do not interrupt the cauterization, for the tears and blood will obscure your view.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the cornea from above and below, so that nothing remains attached except to the cornea; if you can lift it from the cornea by stripping with the thread, it is better, and this may be possible in some people.
And when you have cut it, let its place be cauterized for several days, to relieve its pain and prevent hot swelling, then return to work on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
On returning the nasal bone to its place.
Physicians call a nasal bone a fistula; if you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine as previously described and it does not heal, then there is no remedy for it except to incise the swelling when it is ripe and extract all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed.  And when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument of this form:
The rasp, which is made of Indian iron, is called the head. Its head is round like a button, finely engraved with the engraving of a file or a rasp. You place it on the affected part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, pressing gently with your hand, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.
Do this several times, then dress the wound with drying and astringent medications. If the wound closes and flesh grows over it, and the discharge ceases, and it remains for forty days without recurring, festering, or any incident occurring,
know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no remedy except to return the fistula to the nasal passage in this manner:  You uncover the bone again with an instrument or a sharp medicine.  When the bone is uncovered, take a probe of this form:
The tip of the instrument is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapering to the tip, as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the ethmoid and a little further from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
by feeling the air escaping from it when he holds his hand to his nose. Then dress the wound with the drying astringent medications as I have taught you. If flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter that was flowing outwards will return to the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In returning the protrusion of the eye.
If the eye protrudes completely, and no damage or deficiency occurs in the vision, then it is necessary to purge the patient, then to cup him in the nape of the neck, then to apply a cupping glass to the nape of the neck without any condition and to gently suck.
Then apply a poultice made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and gum tragacanth to the eye, then bind the eye above the poultice with many pledgets. The method of making the pledgets is to take many soft pieces of lint and fold each piece into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one upon another as much as the eye needs, then bind it firmly with a strong cloth and repeat the cupping with gentle suction, then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bound for a day and a night.
If the binding loosens during that time, it should be tightened gently. Then remove the binding after a day and a night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, otherwise repeat the poultice, pledgets, binding, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cutting the uvula.
If a hernia occurs in the uvular layer, then it protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is ugly because of it, and you want to cut it, then the procedure is as I describe.
It is to insert a needle into the base of the uvula from below upwards, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the palate, and pass it through, leaving the first needle in place.
Then you cut the place where the doubled thread bends and tie some of the uvula around the needle with it and pull it firmly, then remove the needle and place moistened wool with egg white on the eye and leave it until the threads fall out with the uvula, then treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  And you may pull the uvula from every direction with a circle of cloth until the eye is further protruded firmly, then incise with a thin scalpel reaching the depth of the eye, so that the white moisture flows and the eye descends and withers in place, then pull it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-two.
In the treatment of condyloma.
This ailment called condyloma is a swelling that gathers in the eye resembling flowing water, but it is not.  The method of treatment is that you seat the patient on a chair upright, then take his head in your hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the swelling descend to the lower part with your eye, then it becomes fixed and does not move, and the light departs and the patient sees things as he used to see them. And if it does not descend to the lower part, we know that it is water. If the descent of the swelling is not achieved by what we mentioned,
otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and incise it a little above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the iris until the matter comes out.
Then when it comes out, instill in the eye hot water in which honey has been mixed, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the classification and which is suitable for cupping, with a detailed and explained explanation, so take it from there correctly. Then you should seat the patient before you, sitting cross-legged facing the light near the sun.
And you bind his healthy eye and tie it tightly, then you lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye with the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupping instrument near the cornea, with the thickness of an awl in the white of the eye on the side of the smaller canthus, then you push the cupping instrument forcefully while you rotate it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping instrument that it has reached something empty.
And it should be that the depth to which the cupping instrument goes is the distance from the pupil to the end of the black part, which is the cornea, for the copper you see in the same viewer with the naked eye because of the clarity of the corneal membrane, then move the cupping instrument upwards to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards time after time, and if the water descends immediately, then the patient will see what his vision has opened to immediately, with the cupping instrument in his eye, then it will remain still for a little. If the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping instrument.
Then, if it settles and does not rise, remove the cupping instrument gently while you twist it with your hand little by little, then dissolve in the water some clean Andaranian salt and wash the eye with it from the inside, then place on the outside of the entire eye a compress or wet wool.
With rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye. As for us and the people of our time, we put on it crushed cumin with egg white. If the cupping instrument does not enter the eye because of its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes, Then you should take the scalpel called the *barīd*, whose image is this:
Then pierce with it only the adherent part, and do not exaggerate in the piercing; rather, it is that you make a slight mark for the cupping instrument, then insert the cupping instrument as we mentioned. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm bed on which he sleeps on his back in a dark room.
And he abstains from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food that which softens his nature, and he does not move his head to the right or to the left at all. The bandage remains in place until the third day, then you untie it in that dark room and test his sight.
And you show him things, then you return the bandage until the seventh day.  And it is not appropriate to do this during treatment or after cupping at your hour, but rather you should avoid that before the water rises quickly with intense vision.
If a hot swelling appears, then it is necessary to untie the eye before the seventh [day] and treat that with what calms the swelling, until when it calms, then at that time you release his sight and place a veil on his face, training his sight from under it for days while he is in that dark room, then...
He exits the house gradually and manages his affairs. And know that in cupping, the learner cannot dispense with observation many times; then he proceeds to the work. And it has reached me from some Iraqis that he mentioned that he makes in Iraq a perforated cupping instrument with which he sucks out the water.
And I have not seen anyone in our country who made that, nor have I read it in any book of the early writers.  And it is possible that that is recent. And this is an image of types of cupping instruments for one who is ignorant of them to stand upon:
It is made of copper especially, and its tip is of this thinness itself, triangular-tipped and sharp.
Chapter twenty-four.
In the treatment of the flesh that grows in the nose.
Various superfluous flesh may grow in the nose; some of it resembles a scorpion with many legs, and some of it is cancerous flesh, hardened and dark in color, and some of it is soft flesh not dark in color.
As for that flesh which is soft, neither malignant nor cancerous, then the patient should sit before you facing the sun, and you should open his nostril and cast the snare into that flesh, then pull it outwards, then cut what you have grasped of it with a fine, sharp scalpel from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone. If any of it remains that you could not cut, then scrape it off with one of the delicate instruments gently, so that nothing of it remains. If the bleeding overcomes you, or a hot inflammation occurs,
then counter it as is necessary. Or if it was from the malignant tumors, then hasten to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone, then place in the nose after cutting, vinegar and water, or a drink. If the nose opens and the moisture passes from it to the throat,
know that he has healed. If the moisture does not pass as it should, then know that inside there is flesh growing on the top of the porous bones, which the instrument did not reach in the cutting. Then it is necessary that you take a linen thread of some thickness.
and tie many knots in it, and make between each knot the space of a finger or less. The patient should be skillful in inserting one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or with whatever he can, after he makes it like a button, and he should draw his breath until it reaches the nasal cavity.
and it comes out at his throat. Often boys in school do this sort of thing, and it is easy for whoever wants to do it. Then gather the two ends of the thread, the one end that came out at the mouth, and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to saw the flesh, doing that until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knots of the thread. Then take out the thread, and put in the nose after wiping the blood, a wick that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more.
until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh. Then, as a final thing, put a lead tube in the nose for some days until it heals. If it needs a drying treatment, use that.
And this is an image of the syringe with which oils and medicines are dropped into the nose:
It is made of silver or copper, resembling a small, open lamp, and its conduit is similar.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the nozzle of the syringe flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when you heat oil in it or whatever you wish of juices or liquids.
Chapter Twenty-five.
Concerning warts growing on the tip of the nose.
A wart often grows on the tip of the nose, and it increases and grows larger with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it should be cut off at its first appearance and its entirety excised, then apply to the area either cautery or a burning medicine which serves as a substitute for cautery. If you fail to cut it off until it grows large, then look: if it is hardened, solid, dark in color, and insensitive,
do not use an instrument on it, for it is a cancerous tumor; and I have often seen those who cut this tumor suffer great harm from it.  But if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it is possible to cut it entirely, then let the patient empty his bowels and cut it without hesitation or delay, and treat the area with what dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If their connection is separated by a wound or something similar, know that when a separation of the connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment is rarely effective except in some people.
If any of this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with blood; bring together the edges of the wound with sutures, then treat it until it heals.  If the separation of the connection has separated its edges and each part is healthy, then you should scrape each part to the thickness of its outer skin until it bleeds.
Then bring together the edges with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them mastic and frankincense, powdered.  Then place on top of the sutures a plaster of palm-tree ointment or another adhesive ointment, and leave it tied for two or three days, then untie it.
And change the dressing and leave it until the threads separate themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection, either with needles as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread as I showed you there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the nodes that appear in the lips.
Many people may develop small, hard tumors inside their lips; some resemble a carbuncle, some are smaller and some larger. You should turn back the lip and incise over each nodule and hang it with a hook.
And cut it from each side, then pack the area after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the area with something astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cutting away excess flesh in the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called epulis. You should hang it with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its base, and leave it a while for the discharge or blood to flow, then apply powdered alum to the area.
Or one of the astringent drying powders. If that flesh returns after treatment—for it often does—cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On extracting teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may gather on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums.  They may turn black, yellow, or green, so that decay and ugliness of the teeth reach the gums.
Then you should seat the patient before you, his head in your lap, and scrape the tooth or teeth on which you see scales and something resembling sand, until nothing remains.  You should do the same with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and so on, until you have cleansed them.
If the substance is removed at the first scraping, well and good. Otherwise, repeat the scraping on another day, and again on a second and third day, until you achieve your goal.  And know that a tooth needs many different shaped scrapers of various forms, according to what is appropriate for your work.
For the scraper used to scrape a tooth from the inside is not the same as that used to scrape it from the outside, nor is the one used to scrape between the teeth.  These are several forms of scrapers that you should have, all prepared:
Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat a tooth for its pain by every means, and delay its extraction, for there is no replacement for it once it is extracted, because it is a noble substance, until there is no alternative but to extract it.
If the patient is determined on its extraction, you should ascertain that the aching tooth is indeed the one to be extracted. For often the patient is deceived by the pain, and thinks that it is in a sound tooth, and extracts it, then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have seen this done repeatedly by barbers.
If you are certain which tooth is aching, then you should incise around the tooth with a strong scalpel, so as to separate the gum from all sides, then move it with your fingers or with delicate forceps, little by little at first, until you loosen it.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, and hold the patient's head between your knees, having secured it so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight out, lest you break it. If it does not come out otherwise, take one of those instruments and gently insert it under it from every side, and then move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill that hole with a piece of cloth and pack it tightly with the end of a thin probe, lest it crumble when you pull on it with the forceps.  And you should thoroughly incise around the gum on every side.
And take care lest you break it, so that some of it remains and causes the patient a greater affliction than his original pain. And beware of doing what the ignorant barbers do in their haste and recklessness in extracting it without using what we have described.
For they often cause great harm to people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or part of its roots remain. Or that it is extracted with part of the jawbone, as we have witnessed many times. Then, after extraction, rinse with a drink or with vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the place – and this often happens – then crush some vitriol and plug the place with it.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the vitriol does not help you.  The image of the delicate forceps with which you first move the tooth: they should have long tips, short handles, and be thick, lest they bend when you grasp the tooth with them. And this is the image of the large forceps:
They should be, as you see, thick in the handles, so that when you grasp them they do not yield or bend; short in the tips, and made of Indian iron or of well-tempered steel, with sharpened tips, and at the tip, teeth that interlock to provide a firm and secure grip.
And the tips may be made in the shape of a file, which will also provide a strong grip.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On extracting the roots of molars and removing broken jaw bones.
If, when extracting a molar, a root remains broken, you should apply a cotton swab soaked in butter to the area for a day or two until the area relaxes, then insert the forceps or hooks. whose tips resemble the beak of the bird called the balaraja.  This is an image of the hooks:
They should be made like a rasp on the inside, or like a scalpel. If you are unable to extract it with these hooks, you should excavate the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert an instrument resembling a small lever, which is depicted here:
short at the tip, somewhat thick, and not pointed, lest it break. If the root is extracted in this way, well and good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are depicted here. The first has a triangular tip, somewhat thick:
Another fine triangular image:
And we may also use this instrument with two branches, which is also depicted here:
And other instruments and tools previously mentioned in the extraction of teeth. We may also use this instrument resembling a large hook, which is depicted here:
Triangular, with a curved tip, somewhat thick, lest it break, and not pointed. Know that the instruments for teeth are numerous, as are all other instruments; they are almost countless, and the skillful and clever artisan may invent for himself instruments according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
For there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, due to the variety of their types.  If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decays, then examine it in its place with one of these instruments and hooks which were mentioned in the extraction of roots.
And we use a curette, its image is this:
It should be somewhat thick to control the bone so that it does not escape until the bone is removed. And we dress the area with appropriate medicines. If the bone has a slight decay, then clean it of its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two
On the extraction of molars growing on top of others.
If molars grow in a place other than their natural course, it is unsightly, especially if this happens in women and slaves.  It should be examined; if the molar has grown behind another tooth,
and its extraction or repositioning is impossible, then extract it.  If it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, whose image is this:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron.  The cutting should be done over many days because of the tooth's hardness, so as not to loosen other teeth.  But if it is protruding and you can file it, file it with an Indian file, whose image is this:
It should be entirely of Indian steel, very finely engraved, like the file used to make needles. File the tooth little by little over many days gently, so as not to loosen the tooth and cause it to fall out. Then smooth it and remove it with some forceps.
If part of a tooth is broken and it hurts the tongue when speaking, it should also be filed until the roughness of the fracture is removed, it is leveled and smoothed, and it does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three
On Binding Loose Teeth with Silver or Gold Threads.
If the front teeth become loose and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything to eat for fear that they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not worked.
The solution is to tie them with a gold or silver thread; gold is better because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, while gold remains unchanged forever. The thread should be of medium fineness and thickness, according to what fits between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between two sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach a sound tooth on the other side by weaving.
Then weave back to the side you started from, and pull gently and skillfully so that they do not move at all.  Tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose. Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them, twist them together, and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
So that it does not injure the tongue. Then leave it tied as long as it remains. If it loosens or breaks, tie it with another thread.  In this way, he will enjoy it his whole life. This is an image of the teeth and the manner of binding between two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
It may be that a single tooth or two, after falling out, are returned to their place and bound as we described, and remain. This is done by a skilled dentist.  He may carve a piece of ox bone to resemble a tooth and place it in the space where the tooth has gone. And it is tightened as we said, and it remains, and he enjoys it.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Concerning cutting the ligament which appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound which has healed.
And the procedure is that you open the mouth of the patient and place his head in your lap and raise his tongue, then cut that nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its restraint. If there is some stiffness and complexity, and this is from a healed wound, then insert a hook into it and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots are undone.
And beware that the incision is not deep into the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding results. Then let him rinse his mouth after the cutting with rose water or with vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a pledget of lint which the patient holds in place each night.
Lest it unite again. If bleeding occurs, place powdered alum on the place; and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the area with a lentil-shaped cautery suitable for this. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the removal of a frog generated under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and perhaps it may grow large until it fills the mouth.  The procedure is to open the patient's mouth toward the sun and look at the tumor.
If you see it dark in color or black and hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer. But if it is inclined to whiteness and contains moisture, then pierce it with a probe and incise it with a fine scalpel, and free it from every side.
If blood overwhelms you during your work, apply powdered vitriol until the bleeding stops, then return to your work until you remove it completely. Then have the patient rinse the mouth with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors; there may appear in the interior of the throat glands resembling those that appear externally, called tonsils. If you treat them with what I mentioned in the section and they do not heal,
then look; if the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive, do not approach it with the iron. And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not approach it with the iron either, for fear of hemorrhage, but leave it until it matures, then either you may lance it, or it may break open of its own accord.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut. The procedure is that you should look before operating whether its hot inflammation has completely subsided, or lessened somewhat.
Then seat the patient facing the sun, his head in your lap, and open his mouth.  Have an assistant at hand who will press his tongue downwards with an instrument of this shape:
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When the tongue is pressed down with it and the tumor is revealed to you and is in your sight, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil and pull it outwards as much as possible without pulling along any of the membranes.
Then cut it with an instrument of this shape: it resembles scissors, except that its two ends are curved, and the edge of each is very sharp.  It is made of Indian iron or Damascene steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel of this shape:
sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After you cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. Then, after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops. Then treat him until he is healed. Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils; cut them as I described for the tonsils.
I treated a woman who had a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a polyp, somewhat insensitive, which nearly blocked her throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and was prevented from eating and drinking water.
She was on the verge of death if she remained for a day or two. Two branches extended from the tumor until they emerged from her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserted a hook into one of them, and pulled; a suitable piece was extracted.
Then I cut it where I reached it through the nostril. Then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut some of it. Only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and then to eat.  We repeatedly cut away portions of the tumor over a long time, and the tumor kept replacing what was cut, until this treatment extended for a long time for both of us.
Then I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat with a cautery.  It stopped growing, and she traveled away. I did not know what God did with her afterwards.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cutting a tumor of the uvula.
That which is called 'an-`unabah' if it descends as a growth to the uvula and swells, and is white and elongated, is called 'amood'; and if it is thick below and round, it is called 'an-`unabah'. If it is treated with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment is ineffective,
and I saw that the hot tumor had subsided from it and it was thin, then it should be cut, and whatever was gathered together in a round shape and did not have length, and was bloody or the color of pus, or black, or without sensation, then it should be avoided cutting it.
For there is danger to the patient. Therefore, if you see it in the manner that I mentioned, of its whiteness and length, then seat the patient facing the sun and compress his tongue with the instrument previously described, then pierce the uvula with the hook.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in cutting the tonsils. And it is necessary not to cut from it except that which exceeds the natural state without addition; for if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient shrinks from cutting it, then it is necessary to use a method in cauterizing it without fear or caution. And the way of cauterization in it is only with a sharp medicine, and that is that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Then compress his tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take from the sharp water which I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization and mix it with unquenched lime and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it.  And this is its image:.
Its end, in which you place the medicine, has a concavity like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat lest something descend from it into his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while you squeeze it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe and wet the cotton in the medicine.
And insert the probe with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula, then leave it. For it will wither and fall after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.
After cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter and wipe away the medicine around it, then gargle with cold water and treat from the outside with poultices and from the inside with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further from fear.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cautery and cutting; it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take henbane, hyssop, thyme, rue, wormwood, chamomile, and dittany, and similar herbs. Gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
And boil them, the pot being plastered with potter's clay, and there should be a hole in the middle of the lid upon which the hollow instrument is fitted. This is made of silver or copper.
And insert the end which has the pome into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is well moistened. Then repeat this several times until it withers. And beware of doing this treatment at the first onset of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling.  It is only necessary to do this when its hot swelling subsides. If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit on its end an eggshell, lest the patient's mouth be burned.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth, and this is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other things that lodge in the throat.
Often a fish bone or thorn or something else lodges in the throat.  It is necessary to remove what is visible to the eye, after you have pressed down the tongue with an instrument in the sunlight.
So that you may see what is in the throat; and if it does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, then it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before his food is digested in his stomach, for perhaps the lodged thing will come out with the vomit; or let the patient swallow a piece of beet or the root of a lettuce.
Or let him swallow a mouthful of dry bread; or take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a string, and then let him swallow it.  When it reaches the place of the thorn, pull the string quickly. Do this several times.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out by what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than an awl, and at its end a hook. The patient inserts it gently into his throat while raising his head upwards, and he should be careful not to touch his windpipe, lest he cause coughing and push the bone or thorn further in; or the physician inserts it with his hand.
And it is better for the patient to insert it himself, since he knows the location of the lodged object, and pushes downwards or pulls upwards with the instrument, all this as much as he is able, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine
On removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the section on medical treatment and it is not effective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight after you have pressed down his tongue with the instrument which I have described to you.
If you see the leech, then pull it out with a small hook or with a soft, firm probe. If you cannot do this, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert into the inside of the tube a heated iron.
Do this several times. The patient should abstain from water for the whole day, then he should take a jug full of cold water, open his mouth into it and rinse his mouth with it, not swallowing a drop, and move the water around from time to time with his hand.
The leech will fall out when it feels the water. If it does not come out as we have described, then fumigate the throat with urine and with asafoetida with the instrument which I described in the fumigation of the tonsils.  Do this several times; then it will fall out.
The method of fumigation is as follows: Take a pot containing hot coals heated by fire, the pot being covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole.  You then fit the end of the instrument into that hole, then you throw in the incense. The patient places his mouth at the end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the incense does not escape, until it is known that the incense has reached his throat.
Then the leech will fall out. If it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation several times. The patient should endure thirst and eat salt and garlic and not drink water; it must come out with this treatment. This is an image of an instrument by which to draw out the leech from the throat when it is seen.
It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which enters the throat, and its ends resemble the mouth of a bird; they have the roughness of a file, so if they grip something, they do not let go.
And another instrument, with which the tongue is compressed; it is a wide iron ring, large enough to encompass the mouth above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, so the mouth remains open without the patient's will, and he cannot remove it at all until it is taken away.
A description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened in this very way.
Chapter Forty.
It will discuss the cauterization and incision of tumors.
Tumors are numerous and varied in kind, as will be mentioned one by one in this book. They differ in their cauterization and incision in two respects: one, from the type of tumor itself and what it contains of humors.
The second type is due to the locations in the body where they occur, for a tumor occurring in the head is not like a tumor occurring in the rectum, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy place is not like a tumor occurring in a joint; each has its own treatment.
Some tumors should not be cauterized except after the pus in them has matured and is complete, and some should be cauterized while they are raw and not fully matured, such as tumors that are near the joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition persists until it putrefies what is around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing the paralysis of that limb, or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay its cauterization until it matures, you will harm that vital organ, or it may be near the rectum, so cauterize it raw.  It is necessary to cauterize a raw tumor that is not fully mature which is near the rectum, lest the pus fester and penetrate into the rectum, becoming a fistula.
And it becomes something that does not heal.  You should know the time to cauterize tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever goes away, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor becomes pitted, and all other signs [appear].
And it is preferable to perform the cauterization in the lowest part of the tumor, if possible, so that the flow of pus is easier downwards, or in the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  The cauterization should be lengthwise if the tumors are in the hands or feet.
And the locations of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and in general, in all flat areas that do not bend. As for those that bend, the cauterization should follow the shape of that area. But if the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to leave it uncauterized.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said, for if you cauterize it before that, the pus will flow from it for a long time, causing much harm and filth, and perhaps its lips and its core will harden. Some tumors may be cauterized across the body, when necessary, or according to the needs of the affected member.
You should use a single cauterization for small tumors, and for large tumors, a wide cauterization or many incisions, according to the size of the tumor.  There may be tumors that require the skin to be scraped and cut if it has become like a rag.
And it has reached a point where it has died, as happens in many abscesses and hidden lesions. Some of them are incised with a three-sided incision, and some are cut in the shape of an ivy leaf, like the inguinal tumor.
Some use a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions.  If it does not have a head, like smooth, flat tumors, then it should only be cauterized simply. If the tumor is large and has gathered for a long time and you cauterize it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time.
Rather, remove some of it, then dress the tumor until the next day, then remove some more pus; do this repeatedly gradually until you remove all of it.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden removal of pus, so the patient may die and you are unaware. Therefore, beware of this matter greatly.
After cauterizing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and observe. If the wound of the tumor is small, or the incision is single and simple, use a dressing of linen or worn cotton.  If the tumor is large and the cauterization incisions are numerous,
you should insert a wick into each incision until some reach each other. And if some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or scraped away, then you should pack it with worn cotton or linen lint without moisture and dress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the methods, treatment, and cauterizations that we have described in many places in this book and in the treatise. If it is winter and the location of the tumor is very sensitive, you should moisten the bandages with a warm syrup and oil.
And place them on the affected area. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply bandages soaked in water and oil, or in syrup and oil, all of it cold, until the third day, as we said. Then you should unwrap the tumor and wipe it.
And use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the details, I have described the treatment of each tumor separately, summarized and categorized.
Chapter forty-one.
On the incision of tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp; they are a type of abscess contained in sacs, which have conditions like a chicken's crop.  Their types are many; some are fatty, and some contain a moisture resembling mud.
Some contain moisture resembling pus and broth, and so on.  Some are hardened and solid.  There is no danger in incising and removing all of them, unless you encounter an artery during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called the *muddass*, until you know what it contains. If what it contains is moisture, then incise it lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from line B to line C. When the moisture has been emptied, remove the sac that contained that moisture and cut it all away, leaving nothing of it at all; for it often returns if any of it remains.
Then dip cotton in the  *marham sirri* if it is present, otherwise in salt water, and fill the wound with it and leave it until the next day; for it eats away what remains of the sac. Then apply the cotton with the *marham sirri* again, a second and third time if needed.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains fatty material, incise it in this manner:
With a firm incision, and place hooks in the lips of the wound and strip it from every side, and exert yourself to remove the peritoneum which contains it. If an artery obstructs you, do what I described to you earlier; and likewise do in the tumor if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as I described. The incision on the hardened tumor is easier because it has little blood and moisture.  Some of these tumors which are in the head in some people have no moisture at all.  And I incised a tumor in...
The head of an old woman, and I found the tumor like a hard, rough, white stone; it was not possible to break it, and if someone threw it, it would cut him.  And it was not like the other tumors occurring in the head, except for these, like the tumors which appear in the heads of children.
And at the roots of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision, and make their bottoms from their lower parts so that the flow of material to the bottom is easier, then treat them with whatever treatment suits them.
Chapter Forty-Two.
Concerning the incision on the swellings which frequently appear in the neck. These tumors frequently appear in the neck and under the armpits and in the groins, and they may appear in the rest of the body.  That which appears in the neck may be one or many, and some develop from others.
And each swelling of them is within a special membrane, as is the case with the hernias and the tumors of the head as we described, and the types of these swellings are many; some are calcified, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
And what I have seen of them that were in good condition to the touch, and their appearance was near to the color of the skin, moved in every direction, and were not adhering to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, nor were they deep-seated. Then it should be incised with a simple incision from above to below the body in this manner, from line ~j~ to line ~b~:.
And peel it from every side and stretch the edges of the skin with a hook or with two hooks or with many hooks if that is necessary, as we said in the tumors of the head, and remove it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and let the scalpel not be very sharp.
Lest your hand exceed in cutting or the patient be disturbed, and you cut what you do not need to cut; for if you cut a vein or an artery and it hinders you from working, then place in the wound powdered alum or some of the styptics which stop the blood.
And bind the wound and leave it until the acuteness of the tumor subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate, for the blood will then stop; then return to your work until you finish, then search with your index finger if there remain any other small polyps, then cut them and cleanse them.
But if there is a large vein at the root of the polyp, then it should not be cut from its root, but it should be tied with a strong double thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm, then stuff the wound with old cotton which has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if the polyp is entirely cut, then it is necessary to bring together the edges of the wound and stitch it immediately after you know that no residue remains at all; but if you see that a residue of the bone of the polyp remains,
then it is necessary that you aim at cutting to its root and base, and use the stitching and what we have mentioned; and as for those polyps that contain fluids, apply a simple cautery where the place of their ripening appears to you, and make the cautery from what is below, as we said.
Then, after the cautery, use a dressing with Egyptian ointment and the like, so that it eats away what remains of the corruption; until, when you see that the wound has become clean, treat it with ointments that grow flesh until it heals.
Chapter forty-three.
On the incision of the throat for a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is the account of their words. As for those with diphtheria, it is necessary that they avoid the incision of the throat, since they do not benefit from it.
Because all the veins and the lung will be weak. But those who have a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no illness in the windpipe, then it is necessary to use the incision of the throat to escape the danger that occurs from suffocation.
Then, if we want to do that, we should incise the throat below three or four rings of the windpipe, a small transverse incision between two rings, to the extent that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage. This place is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are far from it. If the physician is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until he reaches the windpipe, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should incise the membrane which we have described.  He will know that he has incised the windpipe from the phlegm which comes out of it, along with what is torn, and from the interruption of the voice. The wound is left open for a time, and when the time during which suffocation was feared has passed, the edges of the wound are brought together from the skin.
And its outline alone, without the cartilage. Then use the medicines which make flesh grow until it heals.  The author of this book said: the explanation of this statement that we have mentioned is only if they see that the patient's throat is obstructed by one of these tumors which they mentioned.
And the patient was close to death, and his life was about to end, they proceeded to incise the throat so that the patient might breathe somewhat at the site of the wound, and be saved from death.  And they were ordered to leave the wound open until the crisis of the illness passes, and its crisis is three days or so.
Then they were ordered to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. What I witnessed myself is that a maidservant took a knife and threw it at her throat, cutting some of the windpipe. I was called to treat her, and I found her gasping like someone who has been slaughtered.  So I uncovered the wound.
Then I found that the blood which came from the wound was slight, and I was certain that she had not cut a vein nor an artery.  Air was coming from the wound, so I proceeded to sew the wound and treat it until it healed.  And nothing happened to the maidservant except a slight hoarseness in her voice.
And after days she returned to her best condition. From this we say that an incision of the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter forty-four.
Concerning the incision on the tumor which appears in the throat from the outside and is called the throat’s elephantiasis.
This tumor which is called the throat’s elephantiasis is a large tumor, the color of the body. It is frequent in women and is of two kinds.
Either it is natural or accidental. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it, but as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembling fatty swellings, and the other resembling the tumor which results from the complication of the artery, and there is danger in its incision. Therefore, one should not at all use the iron on them, except what is small of them. If you probe and examine them with a probe and find them to resemble fatty swellings, and not connected to anything of the veins, then incise it as you incise fatty swellings. And remove it with its containing sac if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove all of it, then treat the area with what is appropriate of treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
On the incision of various swellings.
Swellings are numerous in types, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a swelling and an abscess, since it is difficult.  I say that with an abscess there is heat, fever, and severe pain until the boiling of the matter subsides. And the putrefaction is completed, then the fever and intensity subside.  A swelling is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain, and it is contained in a membranous sac, which is its own special covering; and it is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a lentil, and it becomes like a small blister, larger and smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty, or it contains moisture. The colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when you come to treat a swelling, you should probe and examine it first with the instrument called the probe, as its image will come in the chapter after this.
Assess the size of the swelling, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If fluid of any color comes out, then incise it with a simple incision as I mentioned in other swellings. If no fluid comes out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.
Then make a firm incision on it in this manner as I taught you, and hang it with hooks and peel the skin from every side gently, and preserve the sac if you can so that you may remove it whole with the swelling.
If the sac is perforated during the procedure and you cannot remove it whole—and this often happens—then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part remains, however little or much, the swelling will return in most cases.
If it overcomes you and a little remains, cauterize the wound at the end with some sharp cauterizing points, and tighten the wound and place on top of it something that soothes hot swelling, and treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the swelling is large, then suture its edges and treat it with what unites [the tissues].
If you encounter a bleeding or non-bleeding vein and bleeding occurs, immediately cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound becomes infected and the flow of blood stops, then return to removing what remains of the swelling.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the forms of instruments.
Those which are used in incision and cauterization; among them are the forms of probes, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are made of iron or steel, square-ended and firm, to facilitate entry into tumors. These are images of probes, called *bard*, and they are also of three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are suitable for examining tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities for what is inside them, such as bone and the like. They are made round, polished, and smooth like styluses, from Chinese copper or electrum, or from copper, or from iron, or from silver; and the best are those made from electrum.
Probes can also be made of lead, and are suitable for probing fistulas which have a bend in their depth, so that they flex smoothly along that bend.  They are also of three types, for there are long ones, medium ones, and short ones.
According to the depth needed for each fistula, and its thickness is made according to the width and narrowness of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks; they are numerous types, for there are simple ones, that is, those with one hook, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small; and there are blind hooks, and they are of three types; and there are hooks with two hooks, and they are of three types; and there are bent hooks with two hooks. And they are of three types.  And there are hooks with three hooks, and they are of three types. And all of these types, each one is needed in its place. Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.

And these are images of the scalpels with which one incises and excises ulcers and tumors.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its edges, with which it incises, are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp.  Rather, they are made thus so that one may use them in excising the ulcer when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be eased and find a little relief from the burning that he feels when the tumor is excised.
And these are images of the probes. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large probe.
It is made of copper, similar to the cylindrical instrument with which one applies kohl, and at one end there is something like a broad spoon of two layers, which has at its head a hidden blade, similar to a bird's tongue, that moves in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of the scalpels which are inserted between the fingers when cauterizing tumors, such that the patient does not feel them. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Images of the cupping instruments with which blood is drawn. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of the large cupping instrument.
They are made of copper or china, slightly elongated and rounded as you see, and they should be thin.  These types of cupping instruments should be at hand, large and small, to quickly draw blood when necessary and when medicine is unavailable.
But they are not used to draw blood from every part of the body, but rather they are used in fleshy areas such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar moist fleshy organs.
And other small instruments may be made from them, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner:
Blood is drawn with them if it bleeds from a phlebotomy site, or when a vein or artery is cut. And they may be made round in this manner:
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the treatment of men's breasts.
The breasts of some people may swell at the age of puberty, resembling women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly.  Whoever dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner.
From line B to line C: Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with cauterizing medicine, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the breast droops and becomes flaccid because of its bone, as happens to women,
it should be incised in its upper sides with two crescent-shaped incisions, each connecting to the other at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one, in this manner: From line B to line C, then remove the skin between the incisions and remove the fat, and use what we mentioned of sutures and dressings and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If you cannot remove all that needs to be removed because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter forty-eight.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the type of hard boils contained in a sac, and some contain fluids.  Those that contain fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
from line B to line C.  If all the fluid in the tumor is evacuated, pack it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of a knot of boils, incise it as we mentioned in the incision on boils. If the wound progresses to the point that pus extends, use cautery as we mentioned previously.
Chapter forty-nine.
On the incision of a tumor that appears near an artery or vein, called aneurysma.
If an artery is injured and the skin above it heals, a tumor often results from this; similarly, a vein may also develop a swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one knows whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or from a vein: if the tumor is from an artery, it is oblong and deep-seated in the body; and if you press the tumor with your finger, you feel as if it has a creaking sound.
That which is from a vein, the tumor is round and on the surface of the body. Incision of these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other places of the body, and those which are very large; therefore, it is necessary to avoid treating them with iron.
And those that are also in the extremities or in the head should be avoided. As for those that are a swelling of the mouth of the artery, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, then open the incision with hooks, then peel the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I have shown you in the ligation of the two arteries in the temples; then incise with a scalpel the place between the ligatures until all the blood in it comes out.
Then the tumor resolves, and then use treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from a vein incision, then you should grasp with your hand as much of the tumor as possible together with the skin, then insert a needle below the place that you grasped with your hand, and pass it with a doubled thread until you bring it out from the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with it, according to what I have described to you in tying the grape from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle until what is in it comes out. Then cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then apply a pledget that you have soaked in a potion and oil. Then use treatment that involves twisting and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that results from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a tumor appears in an artery and a vein, so too does a tumor appear in a nerve if it receives a blow or is caused by excessive exertion or the like. This occurs most often in the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a deep-seated tumor, its color resembling the rest of the body. In most cases, it is not painful, but if pressed firmly, the patient feels a kind of numbness. The tumor is not concentrated deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, but not forward or backward. As for that which is in the joints, it should not be treated with iron, for it may cause gangrene. And as for that which is in the head or forehead...
Incise the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its base. If it is large, hook it with a hook and peel it off, then remove it and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter fifty-one.
On cutting warts that appear in the abdomen.
Many people develop warts on their abdomens and other parts of their bodies, called fungal warts because of their resemblance to mushrooms. Their base is thin and their head is thick; their lips may be inverted, and some are small while others are very large.
I once saw a man who had two warts on his abdomen that resembled mushrooms; they were white, thin at the base, their lips inverted and cracked, and moisture constantly flowed from them. I cut them off; one weighed about eighteen ounces and the other about six.
In cutting them, observe that if the patient is moist and the wart is white, moist, and thin at the base, cut it with a wide scalpel. Have cautery irons ready at hand, for often much blood flows when they are cut.
If the bleeding is excessive, immediately cauterize it. If you see that the patient is cowardly and afraid of being cut with iron, take a strong lead thread and tie it tightly around the wart of this type, leaving it for two days, then tighten the lead further, continuing to tighten it.
Tighten it repeatedly until it affects the wart so that it is severed and falls off by itself without difficulty. If the wart has a thick base, there is some danger and uncertainty in cutting it, especially if it is in the abdomen; however, it may be possible to cut off half or part of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, and then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of attempting to cut a wart that is dark in color, insensitive, and foul in appearance; for it is a cancerous tumor, and we shall discuss cancer later.
Chapter fifty-two.
On the treatment of an umbilical polyp.
An umbilical polyp arises from many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum of the abdomen, from which fat or intestine protrudes, as happens in other hernias; or from blood emitted from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from gas that is impacted in it.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and the protrusion of fat, then the color of the tumor will resemble that of the body, it will be soft without pain, and will appear in various positions. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, its position will be, as we have described, more variable.  If you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns; and sometimes there is a gurgling sound. It increases considerably upon entering a bath and with severe exertion. If it is due to moisture, then it will be soft.
It does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then, along with these signs, the tumor will appear dark. If it is due to newly grown flesh, then the tumor will be firm, hard, and remain at a constant size.
If it is due to gas, its touch will be soft.  The treatment in this case is that you should observe; if the umbilical polyp is due to blood from an artery or vein, or gas, then you should abstain from treating it, for there is danger and deception in that, as I have informed you in the chapter where I mentioned tumors that arise from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical polyp is due to the intestine or fat, then you should instruct the patient to restrain himself and stand erect and extended, then you should draw a line with ink around the entire umbilicus. Then you should order him to lie on his back before you. Then you should incise with a broad scalpel around the umbilicus at the place you marked with ink, then you should draw the center of the tumor upwards with a large hook, then you should tie the site of the incision with a strong thread or silk ligature tightly.
The knot of the ligature should be a slip-knot. Then you open the center of the tightened tumor above the ligature and insert your index finger and seek the intestine; if you find that the ligature has seized it, loosen the slip-knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen.  And if you find fat, then draw it out with a hook.
And cut off its excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, then ligate it well and return to your work and take two needles, and thread them with strong threads, and insert the needles into the incision which you made around the tumor, crossing them, having passed them through. Then tighten the tumor in four places over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the constricted flesh decays and falls off by itself, or cut it off when it becomes soft and decayed, then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical polyp is from flesh which has grown there.
Or from moisture, then it is necessary that you constrict the tumor as we said, and remove the blood or moisture which you find in it, then treat it with what closes the wound.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medication, and warned against treating it with iron, lest it ulcerate, and we have mentioned the cancer which develops in the womb and warned against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that when the cancer is in a place where it can all be excised, like the cancer which is in the breast or in the thigh and similar easily removable members, especially if it is incipient and small, but when it is old and large, then it should not be approached.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that, and the procedure, if it is possible as we said, is to first purge the patient with black hellebore several times, then to bleed him if there is clear fullness in the veins.
Then you position the patient in a position which allows for the procedure, then you apply hooks suitable for it to the cancer, then you scrape it from every side together with the skin thoroughly until nothing of its roots remains, and leave the blood to flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, press the areas and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can, and if during the procedure you encounter profuse bleeding from a severed artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter fifty-four.
In the treatment of cancerous sores.
We have already explained in the classification the types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type and its treatment with medication.  That which is treated with cautery is only the ascitic type; the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not at all approached with cautery.
For that is fatal; if you have treated this type of ascitic cancerous sore with medication and your treatment has not been effective, then look: if the patient is extremely weak, or if he has another illness besides the cancerous sore, such as…
cough or diarrhea or the like, then avoid treating him with cautery, for that is dangerous.  But if you see that the patient is strong, without illness other than the cancerous sore alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the procedure is to have the patient stand before you. and an attendant behind him to press his belly with his hands and push the water downwards towards the groin, then you take a lancet shaped like this:
pointed at both ends, long, with a defined tip like a lancet, except that it has a slight curve so that it does not penetrate the intestines during the procedure and injure them.  Then look: if the cancerous sore has originated from the area of the intestines…
then you should make the incision three fingers' breadth below the navel, directly above the pubis. If the cancerous sore has originated from liver disease, then let your incision be three fingers' breadth to the left of the navel; if it has originated from spleen disease, then let the incision be three fingers' breadth to the right.
Also, the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie down, lest the fluids flow to that weak area. Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument, and insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
with the lancet between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are flaying it, and the amount you flay should be about the size of a fingernail or so. Then pierce the peritoneum until the lancet reaches an empty space, which is the location of the water, then withdraw it and insert into the opening the instrument which is of this shape:
It is like a tube of thin cane, made of silver or copper or smooth, polished lead. It has a small hole at its lower end and three holes in its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And its tip may be sharpened in the shape of a pen nib, in this manner:
At its upper end is a ring.  If the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately flow down the instrument, and you will evacuate a moderate amount of water at a time, because if you evacuate more than is necessary at one time, the patient may die from the dissolution of his animal spirit.
Or he may suffer a faint approaching death.  But evacuate according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates to you of the strength of his pulse and the good color of his complexion, then remove the instrument and the water will be retained, because it will be retained immediately.
Because of the skin which holds the hole in the peritoneum, which I have instructed you to suture in that manner. Then you may reinsert the instrument another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it.
And you will also remove a little water, doing this for several days while you are careful and guarding against error until only a little water remains. If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand.
And profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and patience with thirst, and treat him with drying medicines until he recovers, and cauterize the stomach, liver and spleen after removing the water, as I have described above.
Chapter fifty-five.
In the treatment of children who are born with their urinary passages unperforated, or with a narrow or misplaced opening.
Some boys may be born with their rectum imperforate; it should be perforated immediately after birth.
With a very fine scalpel, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening, and bind it and keep it there for three or four days. When he wants to urinate, remove it, and afterwards replace it. If you do not use lead, it is possible that the urine flowing to the place will not allow it to close.
As for one whose opening is narrow, it is treated with lead as we have said, for many days until it widens.  Those whose opening is misplaced—some are born with the opening at the end of the rectum and are unable to urinate forward.
So that he raises the urethra upwards by hand, and it is not formed before because the semen is unable to reach the uterus straight, which is a very ugly condition. The method of treatment is for the patient to lie on his back.
Then stretch his rectum with your left hand with a strong pull, and incise the head of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, the size of a pen, or as if you were carving something so that its middle protrudes, resembling a penis, and the opening is in the middle as it should be.
And be careful during your work not to cause bleeding, for this often happens; therefore, stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-six.
On the ulcer that appears in the foreskin and penis, and blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra; it is a rough fleshy excrescence, and there is benign and malignant.  The benign should be tied off with a fine ligature.
And cut it until you have completely removed it, then apply a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with palm ointment until it heals. But if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, you should cauterize it after cutting and removing it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and some of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and some outside, you should remove the ulcer that is inside first, until it heals; then treat the outside.
Because if you treat them both together, you do not prevent the foreskin from perforating.  It may also appear in women, and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption; you should excise all that has blackened and threatens to corrupt or has corrupted.
Then apply honey with crushed and sifted pomegranate peel and quince, then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery of this shape:
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and the wound if it becomes corrupt. If the slough is consumed and disappears completely at some time, then you should insert a lead tube into the urinary passage so that the patient urinates through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the slough...
This adhesion only occurs in those whose foreskin is healthy and who have not been circumcised.  It may also occur due to a wound or swelling. You should separate it with a blunt scalpel until the bond is broken and the slough is freed from every side.
If it is difficult to distinguish them thoroughly, you should separate some of the slough and some of the foreskin, since the foreskin is thin and may quickly perforate because of its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the slough with a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven.
On cleansing boys and treating what befalls them of ailments.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of a connection like other wounds, except that since it is done by our will and is especially used in boys, it is necessary that we describe the best method for it.
And the easiest way leading to safety, so I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is something we have acquired.
by experience, and that is that I found the majority of the surgeons and barbers using purification with the scalpel and with scissors, and they use the cautery and ligation with thread and cutting with the nail.  I have tried all of these methods.
I found nothing better than purification with scissors and ligation with thread, because purification with the scalpel often causes the skin to retract, since the skin of the foreskin is two layers, and perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower layer remains.
So one is forced to make another cut and renewed pain, and cauterization does not prevent cutting the end of the urethra, because it may enter into its hole, and as for purification with the nail, the skin may slip and your work will be spoiled, or the boy's skin may be naturally short.
For often they are born thus and do not need purification, and I have seen that. As for purification with scissors and ligation with thread, experience has revealed its excellence to me, because the cut of the scissors is proportionate, because the blade above is like the blade below.
So when you squeeze your hand proportionately with the two blades, you cut with one measurement and in one time, so the thread becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra from all sides, and no mistake occurs at all. The way to work is first to reassure the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little, that you are only tying the thread in his urethra and leaving him until another day, then rejoice him and please him in every way you can, and what he accepts with his mind, then stand him upright between your hands.
And let him not be seated, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy's eye does not fall upon them at all, nor upon anything of the instruments. Then you insert your hand into his urethra, and inflate the skin, and lift it upwards until the head of the urethra comes out.
Then you cleanse it from whatever dirt gathers there, then tie the marked place with a doubled thread, then tie a second below it a little, then grasp with your thumb and index finger the place of the lower ligature firmly and cut between the two ligatures. Then raise the skin upwards quickly and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and lessens the swelling of the urethra, then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some burnt ash of dry gourd, for it is the best I have tried, or finely ground barley, for that also is excellent.
Then raise the skin upwards quickly and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and lessens the swelling of the urethra, then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some burnt ash of dry gourd, for it is the best I have tried, or finely ground barley, for that also is excellent. Then apply to the glans from above a pledget of white cloth cooked in rosewater, beaten with fresh, fragrant rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And this is the image of the scissors which are suitable for circumcision:
Let them be sharp-cutting, without curve, with a nail-like point, and let the length of the two blades be equal to the length of the handles. As for the mistake which occurs in circumcision, perhaps the inner skin is entirely or partially inverted at the cut, so it is necessary to extend it immediately with your fingernail before the place swells.
And cut it evenly; if you are unable to grasp it with your fingernail, then draw it with a hook and cut it. If three days have passed and what is under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, then leave it until the acute inflammation subsides and peel it gently.
And cut it as seems best to you, and be careful of the glans penis; for if something of the glans penis is cut, it does no harm, so treat it with what closes the wound from the preparations which we described in the chapter on preparations.
And if more of the skin than necessary is cut and it retracts upwards, this also does little harm, so treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter fifty-eight.
On the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Urine retained in the bladder is due to its being obstructed by a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or a growth, or something similar. If you treat this with the various treatments mentioned in the classification,
and the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which has lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that the patient should sit on his knees, then one should mount on his back, and extend his abdomen towards his back, and the patient should hold himself as much as he can.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine will flow. If it does not flow with what we have mentioned, and the matter becomes severe for the patient, then it is necessary to use its extraction with the instrument called a catheter, whose image is this:
It is made of silver, and is thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's quill in thinness, long about a span and a half, with a gentle funnel at its head. The way to draw off the urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie to its end wool or cotton firmly.
And insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the catheter, and cut with scissors if any of the wool is in excess, so that it enters the tube and closes it like a button. Then lubricate the catheter with oil or butter or egg white, and seat the patient on a chair.
And cleanse his bladder and penis with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water. Then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside.
Until the urethra is completely bent, then push the catheter inside until it reaches near the rectum; incline the penis downwards with the catheter inside, then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has reached something empty.
This method is used because the passage through which the urine passes is tortuous. Then pull the thread with the wool gently; the urine will follow the wool. Then remove it, and the urine will flow; then replace the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
The instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as pus.  If you wish to instill water or medicine, this is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its image:
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as a hair, hollow throughout except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow part where the propellant is, should be only as large as is necessary to block it, so that when you draw something up with it, it will be drawn up, and when you push with it, it will be pushed out to a distance, just as the bellows are used to throw oil in naval battles.
If you wish to introduce fluids into the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and draw upwards with the piston; then the fluid is drawn into the body of the syringe. Then you insert its tip into the urethra, as we described in the catheters, and then push the fluid with the piston.
Then that fluid will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it. And this is the image of a fine clyster also with which the bladder is injected:
It is made of silver or lead, its upper end resembling a small funnel, and below it a groove in which the ligature lies. Then take a camel's bladder and put in it the fluid you wish to inject into the bladder, then tie it tightly between the two grooves with a doubled thread.
And warm that fluid slightly over a fire, then insert the tip of the clyster into the urethra, then press your hand firmly on the bladder with the fluid until the patient feels that the fluid has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of thin leather and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around.  Then insert a strong thread into those holes as it goes around. Then gather the circle as you gather a bag, after you have put in it whatever you want of fluids, ointments and water.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the fluid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the extraction of stones.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and described the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and the signs of all of that.  We have also mentioned the stones in which surgery and incision are necessary.
These are the stones generated specifically in the bladder, and those which become lodged in the urethra. I will describe this clearly and concisely.
I say that stones generated in the bladder most often affect boys.  Among their signs is that the urine leaves the bladder similar to water in its thinness.
Sand appears in it, and he scratches and manipulates his penis; it often hangs down and then becomes swollen, and the anus protrudes in many of them. It is easy to treat in boys until they reach fourteen years of age, and difficult in old men; as for young men, it is intermediate between these.
The larger the stone, the easier the treatment; the smaller, the opposite. If we proceed to treatment, it is first necessary to administer an enema to the patient to remove all the fecal matter in his intestines, for this might prevent the discovery of the stone.
Then the patient is taken by his feet and shaken downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times. Then you seat him before you upright, his hands under his thighs, so that the whole bladder is inclined downwards, and then you examine him.
And palpate him externally. If you feel the stone in the space, proceed immediately to incise it. If it does not fall under your touch at all, you should lubricate the index finger of the left hand, if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a fully grown boy, you insert it into his rectum and search for the stone until, when it is under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder. Then you press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place you wish to incise.
And you order a servant to press on the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to stretch the labia upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to stretch the skin under the labia away from the place where the incision is to be made. Then take the scalpel, the shape of which is this:
And incise between the rectum and the labia, not in the middle, but towards the left buttock. The incision should be on the stone itself, your finger in the rectum, and you press it outwards obliquely, so that the incision is wide externally and narrow internally, to the extent that the stone can pass out.
Not larger, for perhaps the finger in the rectum will press the stone during the incision, and it will come out without difficulty. And know that there may be stones which have angles and edges, making their exit difficult because of that.
And some are smooth, resembling an acorn and rounded, so their exit is easy.  But if one has angles and edges, enlarge the incision a little. If it does not come out like this, then you should try to grasp it with a firm forceps, the tip of which is like a file.
To hold the stone so that it does not escape, or to insert a delicate, curved instrument under it. If you cannot manage it, widen the incision a little. If you are overcome by blood, stanch it with alum.
If there is more than one, push the largest first towards the opening of the bladder, then incise upon it, then push the smaller one afterwards; and do likewise if there are more than two. If it is very large, it is foolish to make a large incision upon it, for this exposes the patient to one of two things.
Either death, or a constant dribbling of urine because the place will not heal at all.  But try to push it out, or attempt to break it with forceps so as to remove it in pieces.
When you have finished your work, dress the wound with costus, aloes, and myrrh, and bind it up. Place a cloth moistened with oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water, over it to calm the hot inflammation. Then let the patient lie on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When it is loosened, wash the place with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with palm-tree ointment and basil ointment until it heals. If excessive hot inflammation and gangrene, or something similar, should occur in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing urination—this is known from the passage of blood with the urine—
insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood; for if it remains, it will lead to corruption and decay of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of complication with its appropriate remedy until it heals.
Throughout the treatment, it is necessary to bind and draw together the thighs to secure the medicines applied to the area.  If the stone is small and has lodged in the urethra, preventing the passage of urine, treat it as I have described before it necessitates incision.
I have often dispensed with incision by means of this treatment, which I have tested. It consists of taking a steel probe of this shape:
The end is triangular, sharp, and fixed in a shaft; then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, lest it return to the bladder; then gently insert the probe into the urethra until the probe reaches the stone itself.
And turn the probe in the stone itself little by little, intending to pierce it until you pass through it to the other side; then the urine will flow immediately. Then squeeze what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible due to some impediment, tie one thread below the stone and another above it; then make an incision over the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures, and then remove it.
Then untie the ligature and clean the clotted blood from the wound.  The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other above, so that when the thread is untied after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should pull the skin upward so that it returns and covers the wound as we said.
Chapter sixty-one.
On the removal of stones from women.
Stones rarely form in women. If a woman does develop a stone, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin, and another is that you will rarely find a woman who permits herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or related to you, another reason is that you will not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially the manual work.  A fourth reason is that in women the location of the incision for a stone is far from the stone itself, requiring a deep incision.
And in that there is danger. If necessity demands it, then a skilled female physician should be sought, though they are rarely found.  If you cannot find one, seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or procure a skilled midwife experienced in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge of this craft.
Then prepare her and instruct her to do everything you order her to do, beginning with examining for the stone.  That is, if the woman is a virgin, she should insert a finger into her rectum and search for the stone. If she finds it and presses on it with her finger,
then you instruct her to incise it. If she is not a virgin but a widow, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing firmly.
If she finds it, she should trace it from the opening of the bladder downwards as far as she can reach, until she reaches the groin. Then she should incise at the point opposite the middle of the vulva at the groin, whichever side she feels the stone on.
And her finger should not leave the stone, pressing on it. Let the incision be small at first, then insert the probe into that small incision. If she feels the stone, she should enlarge the incision as much as she deems necessary for the stone to come out. And know that there are many types of stones.
Some are small and some are large, smooth and rough, long and round, and some have branches. Know their types so that you may know what you are doing. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered verdigris on the area and leave it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
until the stone comes out. And make sure you have with you the instruments that I mentioned for removing stones from men, to help you in your work. If the bleeding is excessive, and you know by the pulsating blood that an artery has been severed, apply styptics to the area.
And bind it tightly with ligatures, and leave it and do not disturb it, and leave the stone and do not remove it, for the patient may die. Then treat the wound. When the bleeding subsides after some days, and the area becomes infected, return to your work until you remove the stone.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On the incision of the watery bladder.
The watery bladder is merely an accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle; and it is called the scrotum.  It may be in a special membrane prepared for it by nature in one part of the testicle.
So that one might think it is another testicle. It is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum that we have mentioned, but this happens rarely. This bladder is generated from a weakness that affects the testicles, so this matter gathers there. It may also result from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture is of many colours; sometimes it is yellowish, sometimes bloody red, sometimes dark like pus, and sometimes watery white, which is most common. The signs by which it is known are:
Where the water collects, if it is in the white peritoneum which we mentioned, the swelling is round, somewhat elongated like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in a special membrane for it, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, a person imagines that it is another testicle. If the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum, then it is palpable. But if you want to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose image we have shown previously; whatever comes out in the wake of the probe, you judge it by what is inside.
If we proceed to treatment with the cautery, then you should order the patient to be bled, if he is able and you see his body is full.  Then he should lie on his back on something slightly raised, and you place many cloths underneath him. Then you sit on his left side.
And you order a servant to sit on his right side, stretching his penis towards one side of the scrotum's skin and towards the region of the groin. Then you take a wide scalpel and incise the scrotum's skin lengthwise in the middle, almost to the pubis.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum's skin in half, until you reach the white peritoneum containing it.  Then peel it back and be careful not to tear it; your peeling should be more from the side attached to the testicle.  And complete the peeling as much as you can.
Then you widely incise the peritoneum filled with water and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with hooks and extend the peritoneum upwards, but do not touch the containing scrotal skin. And cut the peritoneum however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, you cannot be sure the water will not return. If the testicle emerges from its skin during your work, then when you have finished cutting the peritoneum, return it, and then join the edges of the scrotum’s skin with sutures.
Then treat it like any other wound until it heals. If the testicle is already damaged by another disease, you should ligate the vessels in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as mentioned.
If the collected water is in both sides, know that they are two hydroceles. Incise the other side as you did the first, or if it is easier to do them both at once, then do so.  Then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool that you have soaked in oil or rose oil. And from the outside apply other wool soaked in a medicament and oil, and spread it over the testicles and the flanks of the abdomen.  And place folded cloths on top; these are the pads. And bind them from above with a bandage that has six ends, in this manner:
Then two cloths are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with fluffy wool in this way.  Make the straps to tie it with from wet cotton or wool, and gather them tightly in the waistband of the trousers; one end is taken to the buttocks and back.
The second is taken towards the pubis, and the two ends to the thighs below, and the remaining two ends to the groins, and all the tightening is gathered in the waistband of the trousers.  This hydrocele can also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with an iron.
And this is to take a fine, knife-like cautery and with it incise the skin of the scrotum while it is hot, as we described, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed.  Then take another cautery of this shape:
It resembles the Greek eye, then sear that peritoneum with it while it is hot until all the moisture comes out. Then stretch the peritoneum with hooks and peel off the containing layer with the cautery and cut it as much as you can until you excise it all, and be careful not to let the fire touch the testicle.
Know that this procedure is safer and prevents more blood loss, and is better than the incision method. If you encounter a hot swelling or bleeding or something else during the incision or cauterization, then you should treat whatever you encounter with the appropriate treatment, as previously described.
If the patient is cowardly and does not endure this procedure because of its ugliness, then use cauterization as I describe, if it is confirmed by the evidence we have presented.
If the hydrocele is watery, then the patient should sit on a high chair, then sear the lower part of the swelling with a wide scalpel. Make the cauterization along the length of the body, and make the opening wide so that all the water flows out. Then place cotton on the area and bind it.
Leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out during cauterization, it may be because the white membrane obstructs the mouth of the wound, preventing the water from coming out.
Then you should insert a goose feather or the instrument for extracting the water of hydroceles, the image of which has been shown previously, or slightly enlarge the opening of the wound.
Know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it accumulates, cauterize it in the same way, and the patient should take precautions.
Chapter sixty-three.
On the incision in the fleshy membrane and its treatment.
Know that an incision in this membrane is extremely dangerous and usually leads to death. Therefore, we consider leaving it alone and preserving it to be the best course of action, although I will mention the procedure and the types of tumor.
I say that many tumors occur in the bodies which comprise the genitalia, and this is due to many causes; either from excessive, sharp humors flowing to the genitalia, or from a blow. The color of the tumor will be that of the body, and it will not contain water.
The tumor will be hard, and perhaps it will be hardened, its color dark, and without sensation. It may also be from the twisting and swelling of the arteries, as mentioned previously, or from swelling of the veins.  That which is from the swelling of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it will not disperse. It should absolutely not be incised. As for that which is from the swelling of the veins, nothing of it disperses when pressed with the fingers. This type can possibly be incised, along with other flesh.
The procedure is to incise the skin of the testicle, then to draw the testicle upwards and extract it from the white peritoneum. Free the spermatic cord from the vessels, ligate the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from every part of the testicle, if the testicle has adhered to that growing flesh.
Then it is necessary to extract the testicle and cut it. And if the adhesion is between some of the peritoneums or between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular cut.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut it all and extract the testicle as we said. When your work is completed, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with all other treatments until it heals.
Chapter sixty-four.
On the treatment of hydrocele with a hernia.
A hernia is a twisted swelling, somewhat twisted, similar to a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the intestines and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking.  The treatment of this ailment is similar to what has been mentioned before.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary to seat the patient on a high chair, then push the intestine down, then grasp the skin of the testicle with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
And let a servant hold it for you and stretch it tightly, then you incise with a wide, sharp scalpel an oblique incision along the vessels until the vessels are exposed, then you dissect from each side as I mentioned to you in the dissection of the arteries in the armpits, then you insert a needle with a double thread.
And you tie it at the first place where the hernia appeared and you tie it also at its end, then you incise it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body and you remove what has gathered in it of the foul, putrid fluids.
Then you treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds that you want to heal for a period so that the vessels that nourish one of the intestines fall away, there is no harm in that. If the hernia affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the intestines with the vessels lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, so that they wither and are of no use.
Chapter sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is from a fissure that appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen towards the groins from the flanks of the abdomen, and the intestine descends from that hernia into one of the testicles.
And this hernia is either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its extension, and these two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting something heavy, and so on.  Its sign, if it is from an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is even towards the depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestine. Its sign, if it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that it causes great pain from the beginning suddenly, and the swelling is different, appearing under the skin nearby.
That is because of the exit of the intestine and its passage outside the peritoneum, and the epiploon may exit with the intestine, and this hernia is called intestinal and epiploic. It may also be with wind, and the excrement may flow into the intestine and be retained there, resulting in the death of the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially if constricted. The treatment of this type of illness with iron is dangerous, so one should beware of resorting to it. The method of treatment is to instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand to the inside of his abdomen if it is possible to return it.
Then he lies on his back in your hands and raises his legs, then you stretch the skin next to the groin upwards and incise all the skin of the scrotum lengthwise, then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision as much as needed to open the incision with them.
The incision should be large enough to allow the testicle to come out. Then, dissect the membranes under the skin of the scrotum until the white, hard peritoneum is exposed on all sides. Then, insert your index finger next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the skin of the testicle and the second peritoneum, and with it release the adhesion behind the testicle. Then, with the right hand, retract the skin of the scrotum inwards, and with this, stretch the white peritoneum upwards with the left hand and lift the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision.
Instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upwards, and you completely release the adhesion from behind. Examine with your finger lest there be something of the twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum; if you find anything, push it down into the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum under the skin of the scrotum next to the incision. Then cut the ends of the thread's twists until there are four threads. Then, place some of them on top of each other in a firm manner, and tie the peritoneum—which we said is under the skin of the scrotum—tightly on two sides. Then also twist the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish it can reach it. Lest a hot swelling result from that, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, leave the amount of a finger bone's width of the peritoneum under the skin of the scrotum.
Lest a hot swelling result from that, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, leave the amount of a finger bone's width of the peritoneum under the skin of the scrotum. And cut all the rest in a circular fashion and remove the testicle with it. Then make an incision below the scrotum's skin from which blood and pus will flow, as we described previously. Then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound and apply the ligature which we described.
And one may cauterize the white peritoneum which we mentioned after cutting it, cautiously against bleeding, for that often happens. And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself. If it is slow to fall off, then loosen it with warm water and apply something that will make it sweat until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the other treatments of wounds until it heals.
Chapter sixty-six.
Concerning the windy hernia.  I have not seen anyone dare to treat this windy hernia with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described in the hernia with a sac, that is, that the vessels should be gently tied below after incising them.
Then incise in the middle and treat the tumor with what opens it until the vessels fall out, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter sixty-seven.
Concerning the hernia which is in the groin.
A hernia may appear in the groin, as we said, so that the place swells but nothing of the intestine descends into the scrotum; and if it descends, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time elapses, the fissure in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and epiploon descend into the scrotum; and this occurs from the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
It may also be treated with the cautery in this manner: the patient lies on his back in your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia horizontally to the extent of three fingers, then you separate the peritoneum which is under the skin.
Until the white peritoneum which follows is exposed, then you take a roll and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two protruding parts of the peritoneum to the end of the roll, and adhere one to the other with the stitching.
Then you withdraw the roll, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds.
If the threads are cut, I clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the protrusion of the hernia does not increase.
Cauterization is best in this situation because it is closer to safety.
Chapter sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the scrotum's skin.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and its appearance is unsightly. Whoever wishes to treat it should place the patient on his back.
And he cuts all the relaxed skin over the thick skin, then brings the lips together. And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, making sure the stitching is secure, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, I should not have mentioned it in this book. However, I have mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that the physician may know about it if he is asked, and may know how to treat someone who has undergone it; and the other, that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and similar animals.  I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting.  As for that which is by crushing, its method is that we seat the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not perceptible to the touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, you should hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the cords and make one incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles emerge, then cut them after you have skinned them, and do not leave any of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels. This type of castration is better than that which is by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal may desire mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types: one is that which appears in the area following the perineum or in the skin of the scrotum between the testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from that which is in the scrotum's skin.
As for women, there is one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis like small male testicles protruding outward, one of them like a man's penis, and the two like testicles, and the treatment of the three types.
The two types from men and the one type from women, it is necessary to cut away that excess flesh until its trace is removed, then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals. As for the second type of men from which urine exits from that which is in the scrotum's skin, there is no action in it nor is there any benefit at all.
Chapter seventy-one.
On cutting the clitoris and the protruding flesh from the vulvas of women.
The clitoris may exceed the natural amount until it becomes large and its appearance ugly, and it may grow large in some women until it spreads like that of men and becomes involved in sexual intercourse.
It is necessary that you grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it, and do not exaggerate in the cutting, and especially not in the depth of the root, lest bleeding occurs.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And it may protrude outward like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients call it the tail disease. It should be cut as you cut the clitoris, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vagina is not perforated, or the perforation is small. This may be congenital or acquired.  The acquired type is due to a preceding cause, and may be due to an excess of growing flesh.
or a thin or thick membrane.  It may be in the depth of the uterus, or on its sides, or at its top or bottom. It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and may prevent menstruation. This is determined by examination by a midwife.
If the obstruction is apparent and near, but if it is not apparent, she should examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is from a thin membrane and is close to the labia, then proceed to pierce it.  This is done by placing something like pledgets on the labia, then placing both thumbs together.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread apart. Then she strongly stretches the labia until the thin membrane is pierced and the obstruction is opened. Then she takes wool, soaks it in oil, and places it on the site.  The woman should have intercourse every day so that the site does not close again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a broad scalpel resembling an aspen leaf. If the obstruction is from excess flesh, it should be hooked with hooks and cut.  Have at hand styptics that do not sting, such as acacia, alum, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not quickly close. Keep it in place for several days and use a dry linen wick. Then treat it as other wounds are treated until it heals.  Other fleshy growths may appear in the uterus; these should be cut in the same manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor.  A cancerous tumor in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the mouths of the veins, so that much blood constantly flows from them. If the hemorrhoids persist, they become warts.  Their types and signs were mentioned in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What accepts treatment and what does not accept treatment. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and do not appear to the touch, have no treatment with iron. Those that are at the mouth of the uterus and can be felt are the ones that are treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, then stretch the warts with a probe or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots. Then, when the blood flows from one of the extremities, apply one of the styptics that stops the blood without cauterization.
Such as acacia,  qiṭṭān, frankincense, and the like. Then raise her legs to the wall for a while, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding persists, seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts and the like. Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a compress to her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, apply cupping to the loins and breasts without restriction. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of the  *ṭarāthīth*, or the juice of *lisān al-ḥaml*, or the juice of the branches of *al-ʿallīq* with a gallnut drink, and apply it to the area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of the *ḥāshā*, rough in appearance. It should be cut as described for warts, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the evacuation of an abscess which appears in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may appear in the uterus, such as cancer, the hardened tumor, ulcers, hemorrhoids, the consuming ulcer, fistulas, piles, fissures, warts, and the hot tumor.  I have already described all these diseases, their types, and their signs in the classification.
It is necessary to mention in this section the hot tumor which appears in the uterus, if it is among the tumors which collect for a period, how its evacuation is done with iron.  You should observe; if the pain of the tumor is initially acute, with throbbing, inflammation, and fever,
and you see it red when touched, do not hasten its evacuation, and treat it with what helps in maturation until these symptoms subside; then it is necessary that the woman sit on a chair with two seats and lean on its back.
and she gathers her legs towards the lower abdomen, and her thighs are spread apart, and her arms are under her knees, and they are bound with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the uterus is opened, the image of which comes later.  If you wish to use this instrument, you should measure with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
This harms the patient. If the instrument is longer than the depth, it is necessary to place pledgets on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and the spiral which runs in the instrument should be on the upper side.
And you hold the instrument, and the assistant turns the spiral until the cervix is opened.  If the abscess appears and is touched by the hand and is soft and thin, then it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel. When all the pus is evacuated,
a soft pledget soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some astringent should be placed in the wound. The pledget should extend outside the incision in the cervix. Clean wool soaked in water in which alchemilla has been boiled should be placed externally on the uterus and pubis.
Then treat it after two days with the ointment which is suitable for this, until it heals.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which licorice root or long zedoary has been boiled, then return to the ointment, if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
It is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but it should be treated as we mentioned in the section.
Chapter Seventy-five.
In teaching midwives how to treat live fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural manner.
The midwife should first know the form of a natural birth.  Among its signs are if you see the woman straining downwards and yearning to smell the air, and what she suffers from the labor becomes easier for her.
And the emergence of the fetus is hastened. Know that this birth is in the natural manner, and its emergence is head first with the placenta attached to it or hanging from its navel. If you see these signs, then you should press her abdomen so that the fetus emerges quickly.
For if it descends head first, the placenta descends with it and cleanses itself of those impurities well.  Anything other than this birth is unnatural and blameworthy, for the fetus may emerge on its feet, or its hands before its head and feet.
Or one hand or one foot, or its head and hand emerge, or it emerges folded, and perhaps it turns over on its back and similar blameworthy forms.  It is necessary for the midwife to be skillful and gentle with all of these things and to beware of slips and errors.
And I am explaining each form and how to manage it, so that you may learn about it and understand it. If the fetus emerges head first, the natural emergence, and this is difficult for the woman and the labor is hard for her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then seat her on a chair and instruct women to support her.
And apply a poultice of cooked fenugreek and moist ointments to her womb. Then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and incises the placenta, or incises it with her fingernail, until the moisture within flows out, and she presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then it is necessary to inject the woman with fenugreek saliva mixed with shirāj ointment, then after the injection instruct her to sneeze by using hellebore, holding her mouth and nose; then the fetus will emerge immediately. If the hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary to gently return them little by little.
If they do not readily enter, place the woman on a stool and raise her legs upwards, then shake the stool on the ground while the woman holds on so that she does not fall during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus is dead, then cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them moderately; then he will come out.  The emergence of the fetus with its feet: If the fetus emerges with its feet, then it is necessary to push its feet upwards, then turn the fetus little by little until you straighten it, then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
If they emerge to the thighs, instruct her to sneeze using hellebore; then it will emerge. If it does not emerge as we have described, then return the fetus little by little until you return it to its natural position; then it will emerge easily. If it is prevented by all that we have described,
Take mallow saliva, fenugreek saliva, shirāj ointment, and dissolved gum, and grind them all well in a mortar, then apply it to the vulva of the woman and the lower part of her abdomen, then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the sharisif.
If you see that her lower parts have softened, make her a pessary of myrrh and she will bear it. If the pessary remains for an hour, then seat her on a chair, then make her sneeze, blocking her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze the lower part of her abdomen; then the fetus will emerge immediately.  The emergence of the fetus on its knees and hands:
If it emerges in this manner, gradually insert your hands, then let the woman lie on her back, and lower her hips while she is lying on a bed, and she should clasp her hands, then gently squeeze above her abdomen. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her lower parts are raised. If the fetus does not emerge, take both of her legs and move them vigorously, then gently squeeze above the sharisif until the fetus ascends, then the midwife inserts her hand and gently adjusts the fetus.
And instruct the woman to strain until the fetus emerges.  The emergence of the fetus sideways, with one hand hanging down:  gently try to return its hand; if you cannot return it, make the woman stand and walk. If she cannot walk, let her lie down...
on her bed and shake her legs vigorously, then use the poultice I described from the ingredients. If labor pains seize her, seat her on a chair, then treat the matter of returning the hand and straightening the fetus to its natural form, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to strain until it emerges.
The emergence of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, and its face towards its mother's back: the midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus, then gently turn it and straighten it. Once it is straight, apply to its head what we described of the ointment and poultices.
Then tell her to move a little by little. If she does that, seat her on the chair and tell her to lean to her right side, then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with the feather; then it will emerge. The emergence of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the placenta, tear the placenta with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture. If it is attached to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the navel lest it suffocate and die; then push the fetus inward until it is in the proper position.
And instruct the woman to strain repeatedly, then it will emerge easily.  The emergence of twins or many fetuses: Know that twins are frequently born, and three or four may be born and live, though this is rare; as for five, it is something outside of nature, and they will not live at all.
And they are surrounded, even if numerous, by a single placenta, and they are separated by a membranous partition between them, attached to the navel of each one. And they may emerge as a single fetus emerges, naturally and easily, or they may emerge in a difficult manner as we described.
If some of them are difficult at birth and become as we have mentioned among the unnatural forms, then treat them as we described. Let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and slowness, and let her contrive for every form with whatever means presents itself to her that leads to safety.
Mentioning what is conceived in the womb of fetuses which are aborted: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the womb. It has been confirmed for me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of them conceived.
By the estimation of the All-Knowing, All-Mighty.  All of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a thing may occur to her one day, and she will meet it with what is appropriate.
Chapter seventy-six.
On removing the dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I have mentioned in the section on treatment, and it does not come out, and the matter compels you to work with your hand, then you should look: if the woman is healthy and strong and does not have any of the symptoms which one fears might cause her harm, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be inclined downwards and her legs raised, and a servant should support her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, lest her body be pulled when the fetus is extracted.
Then her womb's mouth should be moistened with moist ointments, along with mallow and fenugreek sap and flaxseed, then the midwife should anoint her hand with these ointments and saps, then gently insert it into the womb, then seek with it a place to hook the fetus with hooks, and the suitable places for that.
Look, if the fetus is positioned to come down head first, then hook into its eyes, or its nape, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or its clavicle, or in the places near the ribs, or under the cartilages.
But if it descends feet first, then in the pubis and the middle ribs.  It is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand and place its curve between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and hook into some of those places which we have mentioned.
Until you reach something firm, then hook another or a third opposite it, if needed, so that the traction is even and does not incline to one side, then pull with a steady pull, and the pull should not be straight only, but moved in every direction.
So that its exit is facilitated, as is done with a tooth when it is extracted.  It is necessary during this to relax the pull; if it is obstructed from one side, it is necessary for the midwife to anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them from that side to rotate what is obstructed. If some of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other places.
She should raise it slightly, doing this until the whole fetus comes out. If a hand comes out before anything else and cannot be returned because of its compression, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it and then pull it until, when it is completely out, you cut it.
Either at the joint of the wrist or at the elbow.  And thus it is necessary to do with the other hand and with the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences difficulty in exiting, or if there is accumulated water in its head, then it is necessary to insert a hooked scalpel between the fingers.
And split the head with it so that the water comes out, or puncture it with the instrument called the perforator, the image of which comes with the images of the other instruments in the chapter which follows this.
Similarly, if the fetus is naturally large-headed, then it is necessary to split the skull or perforate it with the perforator as we said, then remove the bones with the hooks. If the head comes out and is compressed at the clavicle, then let it be split until the moisture in the chest flows out.
For the chest then contracts. If the chest does not contract and it is not possible for it to come out, then cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or has a tumor, then it is necessary to puncture it until the moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is feet first, then pulling it is easy and straightening it towards the mouth of the womb is simple. If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to pull it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and split the abdomen or chest until what is in them flows out.
If all the limbs are extracted and the head returns and is retained, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, then insert the hand into the neck of the womb and search for the head with it and pull it with the fingers to the mouth of the womb, then insert one or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has contracted due to a hot tumor affecting it, then it is not necessary to be forceful towards it, but it is necessary then to use pouring of fatty moist things, and use poultices, and sit in waters that relax and moisten.
And as for if the fetus is on its side, if it is possible to straighten it, then use what we mentioned for the live fetus. If that is not possible, then cut pieces and extract it.  It is necessary not to leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all. When you have finished your treatment, use what we mentioned for the treatment of hot tumors that appear in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, then descend into astringent waters and use all other treatments. I have indeed seen a woman who had conceived and the fetus died in her womb, then she conceived again upon it.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a tumor appeared in her womb and swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close, so I applied some strong drawing ointments to it.
Then a bone came out of the place, then after some days another bone came out. I was amazed by this, since the abdomen is a place where there are no bones. I judged that they were from the bones of the dead fetus, so I examined the wound and extracted from it many bones from the bones of the head of the fetus.
I continued doing this until I extracted many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of health. She lived like that for a time, with a little pus coming from the place.  And I have only come here to relate this rarity.
Because in it there is knowledge and aid for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter seventy-seven.
In it are the images of the instruments which are needed in extracting the fetus.
Image of a screw to open the mouth of the womb.
This is a binding instrument with which books are bound, having two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this screw should be finer than the binding instrument and should be either of ebony or of boxwood, and the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their width about a finger and their length a span and a half, and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two guides of the same kind of wood which have been fastened in them, their length being half a span or a little more, and their width about two fingers or a little more, and these two guides.
are those which enter into the mouth of the womb so that it may be opened by them when you turn the screws; an image of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter.
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two guides at its end as you see, the length of each guide being about a span and their width two fingers; so if you wish to open the womb with it.
Then seat the woman on a bed with her legs dangling apart between her thighs, then insert these two guides gently into the mouth of the womb, while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument as you do with hooks, to the extent that you want to open the womb. Until the midwife does what she wants. An image of another screw mentioned by the ancients.
An image of the instrument which pushes the foetus.
An image of the forceps with which the head of the foetus is grasped.
It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see, and it may be made rectangular like hooks, in this image as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it cuts and crushes.
An image of a pusher also.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so that it does not break when the fetus is pulled with it.  Image of a hook with two barbs.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All of these instruments, the more numerous their types and the better prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his skill among people. Therefore, do not disdain any instrument, however prepared, for there will be a need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold herself, then sneeze into a handkerchief, and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out this way, well and good; otherwise, take a measure.
And pierce a hole in the lid and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as rue, pennyroyal, dill, chamomile, wormwood, marshmallow, and centaury; all of these medicines, or some of them. Submerge them in water, and place them over the fire; then place a silver tube over the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb; then have her sneeze as we said.  The placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in  surgine oil or mallow sap.
Then she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the placenta. If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out little by little. If it is attached deep in the womb, insert the hand as we have described, until you find the placenta, then pull it out little by little along the vulva.
Lest the womb fall out with strong pulling, but it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then increase the amount of pulling; then it will yield and free itself from the adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described treatment with sneezing and treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, avoid violence in pulling it again. But it should be tied—what has come out of it to the mouth of the womb—to the woman's thigh, then inject it with the quadruple ointment, for it will cause it to rot after a few days.
And it will dissolve and come out. However, if it becomes putrid, a bad odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, and this will harm the patient. Therefore, suitable fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients tried the fumigation of rue and dried figs.  The image of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated when menstruation and the placenta are retained, and so on:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or it is made of copper. The thin end is placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the incense is placed on the coals.  She holds it until that incense is gone and replaces it with more.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of the non-perforated fistula.
Many boys are born with their rectums imperforate; a thin membrane closes it.  The midwife should perforate this membrane with her finger; otherwise, let her incise it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then she applies wool soaked in syrup and oil, and then treats it with ointments until it heals. If she fears it will close up, she places a lead tube in the opening for many days, removing it whenever the child wants to defecate.
The rectum may also become obstructed by the healing of a wound or a tumor; this adhesion should be incised, and then treated as described above, with the lead tube.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower parts.
Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are a complication and thickening which occurs near the rectum externally or in the space from one of the sides, and the fistula may be single or multiple.
If this complication becomes chronic, it opens and a watery white fluid or thin pus flows from it. Some of these fistulas may penetrate to the perineum and to the intestine, and some may not penetrate.  Those that penetrate may be recognized by the fact that feces and flatus pass through them when the patient defecates.
And worms may come out of them. There may be fistulas, if they are in the space, penetrating to the bladder and to the urethra.  And some may penetrate to the hip joint and to the sacrum.  A fistula penetrating to the rectum is also known differently from one that does not penetrate.
Insert your index finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe into the fistula, made of copper or iron, if the fistula is not tortuous. If it is tortuous, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing of feces, flatus, or worms, as we said, emerges from the opening, then know that it is not penetrating, and proceed to treatment.
If the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urethra, the indication is the passage of urine from it and the failure of the site to heal with medications.  As for when it penetrates to the hip joint or to the sacrum, its sign is the arrival of the probe there.
If there is no tortuosity to the bone, and pain is present in that area, and pus constantly emerges from it, and treatment is ineffective and it does not heal with ointment—all these penetrating fistulas—there is absolutely no cure for them.
And their treatment is a futile effort for those ignorant physicians who attempt to treat them. As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, recovery is hoped for with cautery, as I will describe and as I have tested.  It is that you place the patient on his back between your hands.
And raise his legs upward and incline his thighs towards his abdomen. Then insert the copper or lead probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel with your finger that the probe has penetrated by itself, uncovered, without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating; do not exert yourself on it, for there is no cure for it, as we have said.
And they have said that it heals in some people rarely. And of the treatments from which benefit is hoped for is that you heat a thin cautery iron according to the width of the fistula, as has been described, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches near the anus, then return it two or three times.
Until you know that all of that excess, congealed flesh resembling a bird's quill has been burned. Then treat it with a pledget soaked in butter until the burned flesh is removed, then treat it with healing ointments, if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment.  But if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger which is in the anus, and there was a thick partition of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the fistula on the surface of the skin, then incise the skin from the beginning of the fistula. And you pass along the incision with the probe while it is in the fistula until you reach with the incision where the tip of the probe ends, and the probe is freed and falls out. Then you cleanse that congealed flesh resembling a bird’s quill, and leave nothing of it.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If blood overcomes you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, then the best and quickest remedy is cauterization with fire or a strong medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that excess flesh.
And cutting the blood and drying the moisture. Then treat it with pledgets soaked in butter or sulfur powdered with oil until the area suppurates and that burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that grow firm flesh.
These are medicines which have astringent and drying properties; for when it is healed, it is cured, and you do not fear a recurrence. If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is far from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it a partition of peritoneum or flesh, and it is near to penetration, then the treatment is only by way of hope and expectation; that is, to employ one of three methods: either to cauterize it as we said.
Or to incise it until you reach its bottom so that you can easily insert pledgets and treat it from near; and do not overdo the incision lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus and cause the patient involuntary passage of stool. Then treat it as we mentioned, for perhaps it will heal, as we said.
Or to penetrate that partition and pierce it after incising it near the anus, as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp-pointed instrument. Then cleanse all that hardened flesh which is in the incision as far as you can, thoroughly.
Then suture the whole wound, including the incision and the upper opening, until it is closed, and the fistula remains open inside the anus; this will be easier for the patient.  And the fistula may be perforated in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is at the side of the anus, towards the surface of the body with the skin and the margin of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end like a shoemaker's needle, in this manner:
And insert into it a twisted thread of five threads or so, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom, if it is penetrating into the margin of the anus from inside, nearby.
Then bring the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and bringing out the end of the thread, and bring both ends together and tighten them, and leave it for a day or two. Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until that flesh between the ends of the thread is cut and falls away. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, penetrate it however you can, except that it should not be too deep, for you should not do that on account of the muscle lest you cut it. Then treat it as we have described until it heals.
The image of the hooked bistoury with which fistulas are incised: its curvature is very sharp, and the other side is not sharp, lest you cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter eighty-one.
Concerning the opening of haemorrhoids from which blood flows, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Haemorrhoids are of two kinds: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red bladders or like grapes, and there are small and large ones, and blood constantly flows from them.
And they may be one or many, and they may be outside the rectum and at its edges, except that those which are outside the rectum are, in most cases, less moist; a yellow liquid or a little blood flows from them constantly, and they are the colour of the body.
The treatment of those which are inside the rectum is that you should order the patient to strain and bear down until the rectum is protruded and the haemorrhoids appear to you.  Then quickly seize them with hooks or grasp them with your fingernail and cut them off at their base; if the hooks do not hold because of their moisture and laxity,
then rub them with a rough cloth or a piece of goatskin, or pull them with your fingers, then cut them, and then sprinkle on them after cutting some sharp powders to act in place of cautery, or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with the other treatments until it heals. If the rectum does not protrude, inject the patient with an enema containing a little irritant to wash what is in the rectum and make it come out quickly when the patient strains. As for the haemorrhoids outside the rectum, their treatment is easy.
That is, you take it with your fingernail or hook it with a hook and cut it, then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals. And whoever dislikes cutting with iron should use a ligature in this way: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the haemorrhoid upwards and pass the needle through its base from the other side, and wind the ends of the thread below the needle while it is crosswise, and pull the haemorrhoid tightly, then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the haemorrhoids and leave one unligated.
so that the blood flows from them, then place on the rectum a cloth soaked in rose oil or kyrios oil and place it on the rectum and tell the patient to be still, then leave him until they fall off. And when the haemorrhoids have fallen off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
And as for the treatment of fissures, they often occur from dryness of the faeces and retention of the humours. If they become chronic and medicine does not work, then it should be scraped with a scalpel blade or with your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper crust which prevents it from healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more severely than before until it bleeds well and is excoriated, then treat it, for it will heal.
Chapter eighty-two.
On the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts and ants.
A corn is a round nodule, the colour of the body, resembling the head of a nail. It occurs on the whole body, but especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to incise around the corn and grasp it with a hook or a snare and pull it out from its root, then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it as described previously in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, clustered, round protrusion on the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of children.  Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it, or pierce it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off; and if you wish, cauterize it with fire or a caustic medicine, as previously described.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument I have described in the treatment of the ant. As for the ant, it is also a small, clustered, thick protrusion on the surface of the body, extending deeply; and if it is exposed to cold, one feels a sensation similar to the sting of ants.
It occurs throughout the body, but most often on the hands.  Its treatment is to take a tube made from a strong goose or eagle feather, and place this tube over the ant so that the circumference of the tube surrounds it on all sides; then rotate the tube with your hand until you incise around the ant.
Then push it into the depth of the flesh, and the ant will be pulled out from its root. And if you wish, you may do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube should be solid and wired to make it easier for the fingers to grasp and twist it.  And if you wish, cauterize the ant as previously described in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
Concerning the shapes of the instruments used for injections in the treatment of rectal ailments, diarrhea, and colic.
Syringes may be made of silver, china, or cast or hammered copper.  These instruments may be made in small and large sizes according to the users. Those used to treat small children should be small, and those whose rectums are narrow or painful should have very gentle syringes. Image of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is attached, is wide in this manner, having a partition where the bladder is tied, as you see.  Its lower end, which is inserted into the rectum, is solid and very smooth, except that on one side there are two holes and on the other side one hole.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a gimlet or slightly larger. The bladder, in which the medicines are placed, is made from an animal's bladder or sheepskin, fashioned in the shape of a small pouch, its diameter being one span.
Many holes are pierced in a circular fashion, the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger. Then a strong thread of doubled yarn, of ten strands or so, is inserted into these holes and the bladder is gathered together like a pouch. When the medicine is placed inside, it is tightly bound at the head of the syringe between the stones, then injected. This is an image of the circle of the bladder and the holes:
The method of injection is to fill the pouch or bladder with warmed medicine, to the extent the patient can tolerate. Beware of it being too hot or too cold. Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs.
A cloth or blanket is placed beneath him. Then the tip of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva, or the like, and gently inserted into the rectum. Then the attendant takes the pouch in both hands and squeezes it forcefully until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the bowel.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs to the wall. If the medicine stimulates evacuation, let him restrain himself as much as possible. If he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial. If it is injected for diarrhea and evacuation is hastened, repeat the injection until he recovers.
If there are painful hemorrhoids or tumors in the rectum, the syringe should be very fine and smooth, smoother than those used for injecting children. This is an image of a fine syringe with its skin stretched over it:
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of wounds.
I have mentioned in the classification the treatment of what resembles cauterizations, and I will now mention here its treatment by hand and by medications completely.  I say that wounds differ according to the thing that causes the wound and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things that cause wounds are many, such as a blow from a stone, or a cut from a sword or knife, or a stab from a spear or stick or arrow, and so on from many things.
As for wounds according to the locations of the body, such as a wound that occurs on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or liver, and so on from the organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and rule for all wounds, and I begin with simple wounds of the head especially, because the compound ones will be mentioned in the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
So I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, I look; and if it is from a blow from a stone or the like, and only the skin has been split, and the wound is large and I fear for the patient the occurrence of hot inflammation, then I hasten and incise it, using a cupping instrument, in that place. And do not delay that, and let blood be drawn from him according to his strength, if nothing prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is little; and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the injured area.
And warn the patient against fullness, and thick drinks and foods; and if something prevents him from bloodletting, then let him reduce food and not approach meat or drinks.  And apply to the wound, if hot inflammation occurs in it, cotton soaked in rose oil alone, or with a drink that contains astringency.
And if you are safe from hot inflammation, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh and the air has not altered it, the powder which I describe to you shortly; but if the air has altered it, then apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. And if the wound is large, and is from a sword cut or the like, and its edges do not come together by themselves, then join it by stitching, as I describe in the stitching of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and hangs down, and its attachment is only by a small ligament, then cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines that produce firm flesh in place of the skin, and order the patient to nourish himself with foods that contain firmness, such as heads and brains and the like.
If gangrene occurs in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the gangrenous part and throw it away, then treat it.  If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding blood, and the bleeding does not stop with medicines, then search for the artery.
If you find it and it is not severed, then sever it with the scalpel and tie it. And if necessity demands, if what we have mentioned does not work, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, then their treatment is easy; it suffices to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are still bleeding.
before the air changes them.  The preparation of the powder is that one part of frankincense, two parts of acacia, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime are taken; all are ground, sifted, and the wound is packed with it and firmly bandaged until it adheres well.
It coagulates with the blood, then bandage it from above with bandages and leave it; do not untie it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not separate from it until it heals.  The lime alone may do this if you do not have frankincense and acacia.
This action may also be done with cobwebs in many large wounds if it is skillfully applied and bandaged, and the wounds are fresh with blood, before the air changes them; but if the air has changed them somewhat, especially in summer,
then applying this powder is meaningless; treat it as mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until pus forms, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
But if a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound and it is slight, pull it with a splint. I have mentioned the treatment of head fractures in what follows, in the surgery of the neck; if the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound if it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with things that strongly constrict, like verdigris and vitriol and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
And nothing cold should be placed on the wound at all, because the substance of the nerve is cold and its connection is to the brain, which is the noblest of the organs, and what you treat it with should be from soft medicines, such as ceruse washed many times with fresh water, moistened with oil or rose ointment and tutty.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner and moist ointments, but if the wound is large, use suturing or bind its edges with pledgets, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a depth and a cavity forms in its bottom where pus collects, lance it in its lowest place; if an artery has been severed in the wound and you perceive its blood flowing, ligate it or tie it off or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx and the cervical vertebrae are unharmed, bring together the edges of the skin by suturing over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, but smooth it and restore it to its natural shape, then tightly bind it and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, examine it; if there are bone splinters in it, extract all of them or as many as you can, and leave what you cannot remove until the wound suppurates and heals, and it will be easier to remove them.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powder we have described. If a bone becomes suppurative in the wound and forms a fistula, treat it with what will be mentioned in its chapter, on the surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife and you see a depth to it, observe it; if air escapes from it when the patient breathes, know that it is a mortal wound. If it has no depth and is fresh with its blood, do not initially apply the powder to it, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depths.
It will then recede to the heart and kill the patient. But put in it an attractive ointment, and dress it twice a day. If you do not have an ointment, put a used piece of cotton in the mouth of the wound to absorb what comes out of it from the moisture, and have the patient sleep on the wound.
So that what collects in it may flow out. And if three days or more have passed since the injury, and the patient has not experienced convulsions, a bad pulse, or shortness of breath, and you see that all his conditions are good, then know that the wound is healthy; treat it with cautery and other treatment until it heals.
If its sight is difficult and the pus flows continuously, know that it has become a fistula; treat it in its chapter.  The patient should lie on the wound so that what collects in it may flow out. If the wound is in the chest or back, treat it with the previously described suturing.
If it is large, cauterize it; if small, use powder. If it has affected the bone and broken off fragments from it, explore the wound and quickly remove those fragments if they are free; if they are not free, leave them until...
the wound becomes septic, for then it is easy to remove them. As for the other wounds occurring in the other members, their treatment is governed by what we have mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-five.
On abdominal wounds, the protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The wound which affects the abdomen may be large, or it may be small or medium.  A large wound may allow the exit of one or several intestines, and their replacement and suturing will be more difficult and arduous.
A small wound may also be difficult in another way; its replacement may be more difficult, and if the intestine is not immediately returned to its place it swells and thickens, making its return difficult.  Therefore, the medium-sized wound is preferable, because returning the intestine is not as difficult with it as with the other two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four types.  Two sutures are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing all other wounds of the body; the other two sutures are specific, applicable to all wounds, but they are most especially suited to the suturing of the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and some of the intestine has emerged and its replacement is difficult, this is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestine has been inflated by the cold air.
If this is the case, then it should be warmed by dipping a sponge or a damp cloth in lukewarm water alone, or in water in which anise, rue, and spikenard have been boiled, and applying it to the intestine until the inflation resolves.
A medicament with astringent properties may also do this, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.  If you see that the inflation has resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which alkanet or madder has been boiled, for it will facilitate its return with the greatest ease.
If its return is still difficult after this treatment, then make a small incision in the wound with the instrument with which fistulas are incised. The first treatment, if successful, is better than incision. Incision is only resorted to after necessity and the failure of other methods. This is the image of the instrument:
One side of it is curved and limited, the other side is unlimited. The thin end is not as sharp as a scalpel, but is slightly blunt. It is an instrument resembling a small forceps, as you see. If the wound has widened and the intestine has entered, then it should be replaced in its natural form.
And its proper place, if you can manage it, is best. But if the wound is large and is in the lower abdomen, then the patient should lie on his back with his legs raised higher than his head; and if it is in the upper abdomen, then his head and chest should be raised higher than his lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always make the side with the injury higher than the other side. This should be done in large and medium-sized wounds.
As for small wounds, position it as best you can. Then have a skilled assistant at hand who holds the entire wound with both hands and brings its edges together, then reveals it bit by bit to the person doing the suturing.
This is the description of a single common suture: take one needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space from the edge of the wound equal to the thickness of the little finger, and insert a needle without thread into the edges of the skin. along with the edges of the peritoneum under the skin from the inside, until you pass it through from that side.  You will have brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers. Then tighten with a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound are firmly joined.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger, and insert another needle, then connect it with thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as needed until you complete the entire circumference of the wound. Let the needles be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin; therefore, they should be of medium thickness.  And the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close to the wound.
lest the flesh quickly tear and the wound open before it heals.  Nor should the stitches be too far apart, lest the wound fail to unite. Then cut off the ends of the needles so they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and make for him pledgets of linen cloth on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
Leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of suturing with needles is most suitable for small wounds, because it may be sufficient to suture them with one or two needles, or thereabouts.
As for the method of suturing for the general wound, it is to bring together the four edges—that is, the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum—at once with a needle threaded with moderately fine twisted thread. Then, when the needle has passed through these four edges, return the needle to the side from which you began.
So the thread will be interwoven from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is like the stitching of a bag which is tightened with it.  And make the space between each stitch the width of the little finger. This stitch is known to everyone.
With this stitch, I sewed a wound that appeared in the abdomen of a man who had been wounded by a knife. The wound was more than an inch wide and about two inches of the small intestine had protruded; the wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
I returned it after its intestine had protruded from the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he was cured. He lived many years afterwards, managing all his affairs, although the physicians had judged that he would never recover.
And it is remarkable that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there were no medicines.  I applied worn cotton to the wound twice a day and dressed it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special stitching, I mention it according to Galen's words: begin the stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. When the needle has passed through the skin and into the muscle going straight along the whole length of the abdomen.
I left the edge of the peritoneum on the side where I inserted the needle, and I passed the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, into the other edge of the peritoneum. When I had passed it through, I passed it again through this same edge of the peritoneum from outside to inside.
And leave the edge of the peritoneum on that side, and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and as you pass it through, pass it into the edge of the peritoneum on its side until you pass it through entirely.
Then begin again from this same side and sew it together with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side, and bring the needle out through the skin nearby. Then return it into that skin and sew the edge of the peritoneum on the other side with this edge of the peritoneum.
And bring it out through the skin on its side. Do this again and again, one after another, until you have sewn up the entire wound in this way. In short, the description of this stitch is that you sew it like furriers sew fur.
That is, you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and you leave it once from the other side until you are finished. As for the second type of special stitch which Galen also mentioned, this is his exact wording:
It is that you sew it in the way that some physicians sew it, joining each part to its naturally corresponding counterpart, so that they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the gut to its other edge, which is as I describe to you.
You should insert the needle into the edge of the gut closest to you from the outside, and pass it to the inside in it alone, leaving the edges of the peritoneum. Then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside through both edges of the peritoneum. Then return it again.
And pass it from the inside to the outside in the other edge of the gut which is on the opposite side. This type of stitch is better than the easy general stitch, which is the stitch mentioned earlier. This is Galen's exact wording. And some have said that the stitching of the abdomen may be straightened with two needles. That is, you insert one thread into both, and begin by inserting the needle from your side, passing it to the other side, and insert the other needle from the opposite side, passing it to your side, according to the stitching of the saddlebags.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its treatment is the same as the treatment of other wounds. That is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you return the intestine and stitch it and secure it, then apply to it the soldering irons.
If the wound has been changed by the air, then apply to it some of the ointments that you prepare until it suppurates and the stitches fall out and the peritoneum and gut are joined together. Then treat it as you treat other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, apply to it from when it begins to suppurate, worn cotton, and change it twice a day as I have taught you, until it heals. For you do not need further treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple. If you fear that the wound might involve the principal organs in pain,
Then it is necessary that you dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpit. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines—and this often occurs—then inject him with a lukewarm black astringent drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a penetrating wound into its cavity. And know that what was thick of the intestines is easier to heal, and what was thin of them is more difficult to heal.
And as for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from a wound occurring in it at all, because of the abundance of its vessels and their size, and because of the thinness of its substance and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. But if what has protruded from the wound is the omentum, and you find it soft, then replace it according to your replacement of the intestine, the same.
If a period of time has passed and it has become green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place which has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for in the omentum are veins and arteries, then cut below that ligature.
And make the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to remove it and extract it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates.  Mention of the wound which occurs in the intestine:  But if a perforation occurs in the intestine and it is small...
it is possible that it may heal in some people, for I have seen a man who was wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach.  The wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and wind emerged, so I treated it, though I did not expect it to heal. So I continued to treat him until it healed and the place united. When I saw the place had united, I feared for the patient that a bad accident might happen to him in his abdomen, but no bad accident happened to him at all, and he remained in the best of conditions. He eats and drinks and copulates and enters the bathhouse and exercises in his service in good health.  Some experienced people have mentioned that whenever a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be sewn in this manner.
And it is that large-headed ants are taken, then the lips of the wound are brought together, then one of them, with its mouth open, is placed on the lips of the wound.  When it grasps and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off, for it will adhere and not come undone.  Then another ant is placed near the first.
And you continue to do this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you return it and sew the wound, for those heads remain adhering in the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm at all happens to the patient. And it is possible that the intestine may also be sewn with fine thread.
Which is drawn from the intestine of an animal adhering to it after being inserted into a needle; and that is that the end of this thread is taken from the intestine, then it is carefully drawn out, then a fine twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is inserted into the needle. And in it is the intestinal thread, and with it the intestine is sewn, then it is returned to the cavity. And this type of suturing with ants and intestine is only by way of hope and expectation.
But if the perforation is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no remedy and no healing at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
In the treatment of the cold and fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and prolonged and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and continuously discharges pus that does not stop, is generally called, in whatever organ it may be, a fistula, and we call it a cold, and a fistula.
It is in reality a hardened, matted, white mass with no pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather; and it is sometimes moist, always discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture is interrupted.  This moisture may be abundant or scant, thick or thin.
And I have already stated in the classification, when mentioning wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and in which flesh does not grow, is so because of one of nine reasons; one of them is either because of a deficiency of blood in the body, or because of its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its edges which prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because it is very dirty and foul; or because the ulcer itself is foul and the matter it discharges is of poor quality; or because the treatment is unsuitable; or because of a general epidemic in the area; or because of a particular characteristic of the area.
Or because it is very dirty and foul; or because the ulcer itself is foul and the matter it discharges is of poor quality; or because the treatment is unsuitable; or because of a general epidemic in the area; or because of a particular characteristic of the area. As happened in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is naturally slow; or because there is one or more bones in it. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the classification.
It is necessary here that I inform you of the treatment of fistulas and sinuses which is done by hand. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body; some of them end in large veins and arteries or in a nerve.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the compound joints such as the hand and foot; and some lead to the vicinity of a principal organ and so on.
Then those fistulas of this kind are among the difficult-to-cure diseases which do not accept treatment and working with them is troublesome and ignorant; but if there are fistulas which have not reached these places which I mentioned and I hoped and trusted in their treatment.
And you wished to reach the knowledge of that, then take a probe of copper or iron if the fistula runs straight, and explore it with it. If there is a bend in the fistula, explore it with a probe of thin lead because lead softens its body.
It will become smooth upon entry and bend towards the bend. If the fistula has many openings you cannot determine them with the probe, then inject one of its openings; for the moisture which you inject into it will pass towards the other openings and flow.
Then thoroughly investigate in whatever way you can to know if there is a bone or nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with many openings.  Determine all of that to the extent of your ability by questioning the patient and the presence of pain when you touch the area.
And similar signs and causes of the swelling. If you have determined all of that with certainty, then proceed to treatment with confidence; and that is that you should look, if it were...
The fistula is outwardly near or in a safe place far from a joint or nerve or artery or vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as I have previously described and remove what is in it of the  matted material, the putrid flesh, and the excess flesh.
And whatever grows in its opening of flesh or wart and the like, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it deeply as much as you can, then cleanse it of all its putrid flesh.
Then use a pledget soaked in strong medications and insert it into the bottom of the fistula which you can reach with an instrument; do this repeatedly until that strong medication eats away all that remains of corruption in the bottom of the fistula.
Then treat it with ointments that cause healthy flesh to grow until it heals. If it does not heal with that, cauterize it as previously described. If the cause of the fistula is bone, and that is certain to you, then examine it and incise it as I have told you, if nothing prevents you from [doing so].
a nerve, or a principal organ, as we said. If the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until it heals. If it does not heal and the pus continues as it was doing,
know that you have not reached the complete removal of the corruption.  Expose everything on it again, and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with the utmost effort, then dress it. If it heals, otherwise, know that that corruption is in a deep recess; expose everything on it again.
and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with the utmost effort. If the corrupted bone is a small bone and you can extract it, then extract it with fine forceps suitable for that.
If there are many bones, thoroughly extract them all and do not leave any of them behind to the best of your ability. If something of the ligaments obstructs you and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and the flesh if it is there, and extract the bones.
If you are not able to extract the bones at once, apply to the wound something that will cause it to suppurate, and leave it for some days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones suppurate, and keep the wound from closing the incision which you made during your work.
Rather, if you fear that, place on it cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments; for when they have suppurated those ligaments and loosened the bones, it will be easy to extract and pull them out.
If it is one large bone, such as a bone of the leg or a bone of the thigh or the like, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption disappears, then dress the wound.  If a large part of it is corrupted and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it.
And cut it all away to where the corruption ends; then treat it until it heals. And I will tell you of a case of gangrene that occurred in a man's leg, to make it an example and an aid to your treatment.  This man was young.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause originating within his body, until the matter reached the leg and swelled with a great swelling, and there was no external cause. Then time passed with the mistakes of the doctors until the swelling opened.
And much matter flowed from it, and he was badly treated until the leg became gangrenous and many openings appeared in it, all discharging pus and the humors of the body. A number of physicians treated him for about two years, and among them there was no one skilled in the craft of surgery.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those openings in a great stream, and the man’s body was thin and his color yellow. Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
Then I found that some of them led to others from all sides of the leg.  I began by incising one of those openings until I uncovered some of the bone. I found it corrupted, eroded, blackened, putrefied, and perforated until the perforation reached the marrow.  I excised what was revealed to me.
And I removed the corrupted bone, and I think that there was no corruption in the bone other than what I cut and excised, and that I had eradicated it. Then I proceeded to dress the wound with cauterizing medicines for a longer period, but it did not heal. Then I returned and uncovered the bone again, beyond the first uncovering.
Then I found the corruption continuous with the bone. I also excised what appeared to me of that corruption. Then I attempted to dress it, but it did not heal nor unite.  Then I uncovered it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and attempt to heal it, but it would not heal, until I had cut about a span of bone.
And I removed it with its marrow. Then I dressed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and completely. This repetition in its operation and incision was necessary because of the weakness of the patient, his poor tolerance, and my fear for his death, because he frequently suffered from excessive vomiting and fainting.  Then he recovered completely.
And in the place of the bone, firm flesh grew, and his condition in his body improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs and was not afflicted in walking by any harm whatsoever. If a projecting bone in a part of the body is fractured,
it should be excised in this manner: you take a ligature and tie it around the end of the projecting bone, and you instruct someone to pull it upwards, and you make another ligature of thicker wool than the first ligature.
Then you tie it to the flesh under the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards, and you expose the flesh from the place that you wish to excise so that the saw does not injure the flesh, and you place a firm piece of wood or a board under the bone from below.
Because if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted bone. The excision should be slightly above the site of the corruption, so that there is no corruption in the cavity of the bone that is not apparent to the senses, requiring you to excise it again.
If the bone is corrupted and is not projecting but its parts are connected, and the corruption is in its middle or in some part of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides, then place the wood from below, and then excise it from the first side where the corruption is.
When you have finished excising it, excise it from the other side, and let the excision be a little distance from the corruption, as we said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and excise the bone where it joins from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy except amputation. If the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or the metacarpus of the foot, its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel away the corruption however it appears to you, and amputate it and clean it in whatever way you can.
And in whatever way it is straightened for you, provided that a vein or nerve does not obstruct you. And know that the instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their setting, their thickness and thinness, their size and smallness, their hardness and looseness. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work an instrument similar to that work.
And know that the works themselves may indicate to you the type of instrument you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this profession, for it is from the skill of the profession and witnessing various types of diseases. He may devise for himself instruments similar to those for each disease, and I am depicting for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.

In cutting off limbs and sawing bones.
Limbs may become putrefied, either from an external cause or from an internal cause. If you treat that corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment is not effective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing stopping it,
it is necessary to cut off that member to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may thereby escape death or a great calamity which is greater than the loss of the member.  And a sign of this happening to someone is that the member blackens until you think that fire has burned it.
Or it may become putrid after the blackening, until that putrefaction spreads to what is next to that member and affects the whole body; then hasten to cut it off.  Likewise, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some vermin, such as a sea scorpion, or a snake, or a tarantula, and the like.
If the corruption or the sting is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.  Likewise, if it has affected the hand, cut it off from the origin of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it affects the bones of the arm.
Likewise, if it affects the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. If the corruption spreads and you see it reaching towards the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient, and use other treatment as much as possible.
And likewise you do with the leg: if the corruption affects the toe, cut off the toe at one of the joints; and if it affects the metatarsus, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends to the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and leave the patient to death. The method of cutting off or dissecting a limb is to tie a ligature below the place you want to cut and tie another ligature above the place.
And one assistant pulls the lower ligature downwards, and another assistant pulls the upper ligature upwards, and you yourself dissect the flesh between the ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is cut or dissected; and you should place linen cloths on all sides.
Lest the saw touch the healthy part, which would cause the patient excessive pain and hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, staunch the place quickly or apply some styptic powder, then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. And I tell you of an example that occurred to a man in his leg, this very condition that I describe to you; that is, that blackness with burning like fire occurred in his leg.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it took the whole leg. So the man, of his own accord, when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb, with the intensity of the pain and burning he felt, cut it off at the joint, and he recovered.
Then, after a long time, that same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand.  So he came to me, and I attempted to restrain that corruption with the medicines I applied to his hand, after cleansing his body; but the corruption did not stop, and it continued to spread into the other finger.
Until the corruption seized the hand.  He urged me to cut off his hand, but I refused, hoping to restrain the corruption, and also fearing for his life if I cut off his hand, for the man's strength was failing. So, when he despaired of me, he returned to his town.
Then it was reported to me that he cut off his hand entirely and recovered.  I have recounted this story to be of help in cases of this kind of disease, and to be a guide to be followed and acted upon.
Chapter eighty-eight.
On the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medicines.
If a swelling occurs in one of the fleshy members and the duration of the swelling is prolonged until it gathers matter, then bursts or is incised, and all the matter within it comes out, and the place remains empty like a vessel.
And the skin over it is like a rag, thinned, and its corruption has not reached the bone, nerve or ligament; therefore it deserves to be called a fistula, and not a sinus, unless its duration is prolonged until the corruption affects one of these members.
Then it is called a sinus or a fistula, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin as it extends, especially if it is thin and like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and the corruption has not reached that extent, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection.  This is to look at the fistula; if it is large and the pus that flows from it is foul-smelling, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris in equal parts, gathered in a vessel and cooked over the fire until the medicine thickens and becomes the consistency of honey. Then take what you need of it and thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the fistula, and bind its mouth, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then remove it by pressing; do this for several days until the fistula is cleansed and the foul smell is gone.  It may also be injected with ash water if this medicine is not available to you; this is to take the ash of grapevine wood or oak wood, and pour water over it.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been cleansed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then inject it with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed.
Or inject it with honey and wine mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, and wine closes the fistula, especially if the wine has a binding and drying property.  When you have done this several times and are certain that the corruption of the fistula has gone, then inject it with something that will grow flesh in it.
Such as taking some palm ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and astringent wine, or inject it with some other medicines and ointments whose properties we have described in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the fistula is narrow and does not allow the injection tube to enter,
widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place in it a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or theriac ointment until it widens.  Similarly, if the opening is also wide, bring its edges together with sutures, leaving only enough space for the injection tube to enter and no more.
Similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is high up, incise it in the lowest place so that the pus flows downwards, for if the pus is retained in the depth of the fistula it prevents the growth of flesh there.
If you cannot incise the fistula downwards as you wish, then position the member so that the pus flows out easily, as best you can, so that nothing at all of the pus is retained in it.
As for the cauterizing medicines which are applied externally to the fistula, and how they should be applied, take some of the appropriate cauterizing ointments, spread it on a linen cloth, the size of which should be sufficient to cover the whole fistula. Then, with scissors, cut an opening opposite the mouth of the fistula, slightly larger than the fistula’s opening. Then spread some soft ointment on another cloth, to fit the opening, and place it there, keeping it away from the mouth of the fistula to facilitate the exit of pus, and do not remove the larger cloth until later.
Several days; as for that on the mouth of the fistula, remove it at all times so that whatever pus has collected in it may come out, and so that you may know whether what flows from it is much or little, mature or immature.
Also, examine the fistula itself: does the patient feel pain in it or not, and is there swelling or not? If your treatment continues in this way, and you see that the material that comes out is slight at the opening of the fistula.
Know that the fistula has adhered or is close to adhering; then resolve it the next day or on the third day. When you have opened the wound, change the cloths and renew the ointment. If after a long time thin pus comes out of the fistula, do not despair of its healing.
Its healing is near, for some people are slow in the growth of flesh in their wounds, and others the opposite. If after many days immature pus comes out of the fistula, know that the fistula has not healed. If the healing of the fistula is slow,
increase the drying medications, and let the medications be moist in consistency and dry in strength, like palm ointment if an additional amount of litharge has been added to it. Among the most effective treatments is to take palm ointment.
and mix it with rose oil, and sprinkle on it old wine of moderate consistency, then knead it and use it.  He may do something similar if palm ointment is not available: honey, cooked until it thickens and is used; or take myrrh, aloes and costus, crush them all and sprinkle them on honey while it is on the fire. Then apply it on a cloth and bind it to the fistula; or apply honey which you have cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle on it the medicaments, and apply the cloth and bind it.
Long zedoary, the root of the asphodel,  the powder of  cistus and centaury may be used in such a case, singly or mixed. Crush and sift them and sprinkle them on the honey described above and use it. If the fistula persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
If it has affected the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it like a fistula, as described above.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
On the treatment of the felon, the injured nail, the excision of the superfluous finger, and the separation of adherent fingers.
A felon is an excess of flesh which grows under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and sometimes grows in the other fingers. If it persists and its treatment is neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it becomes putrid and foul, until it eats away the root of the nail, and perhaps destroys it entirely; and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, so that it has a foul smell, and the tip of the finger becomes broad and its colour livid.  If you treat it with what we have mentioned in the classification, and your treatment is not effective,
then you should cut away with an instrument all the superfluous flesh which grows from the nail, and then cauterize the wound; for cauterization is very useful in this case.  But if the bone is sound and the nail also sound,
and the angle containing the nail has compressed the flesh inwards, causing it to be pinched and injured, then you should place a thin pledget under the angle of the nail which pinches the flesh, and raise it upwards, and cut away that flesh gently.
And you should apply to what remains of the flesh some of the cauterizing, corrosive medicines until it is all gone; then treat it with ointments until it heals. But if the corruption has affected the bone, then you should cut away that bone and remove it, for it will not heal at all so long as there is corrupt bone in it.
If you see that the ulceration and corruption are spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the joints, as mentioned before, and then treat it until it heals. If the nail receives a blow or injury, and severe pain results, you should first bleed the patient.
Then incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, making an oblique incision from above downwards, and be careful not to reach with the incision the flesh under the nail; for by so doing you would cause the patient severe pain and it would be a cause for the growth of superfluous flesh in the place. Then treat the place with what relieves pain.
As for the superfluous finger which grows in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may have bones in it, or it may have a nail; and the growth of some of them is at the root of the joint of some of the fingers.
Or its growth may be in some of the joints of the finger. Those which grow in some of the joints of the finger do not move, but those which grow at the joint of the finger may move.  If it is only fleshy, its excision is easy; and that is to cut it off at its root with a broad scalpel.
As for those whose growth is at the root of the joint, their treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting them. As for those which grow on the finger at one of the joints, you should first cut away its flesh in a circular cut down to the bone, then saw through the bone with one of those saws suitable for this.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion which occurs between the fingers, this often happens, and it is from what a person is born with, or it occurs from the healing of a wound or a burn with fire, and so on.  It is necessary to incise this adhesion.
until the fingers return to their natural form. Then place between them a pledget or a piece of lint soaked in rose oil, lest it quickly adhere; and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until the place heals properly.
Similarly, if adhesion occurs between some of the fingers and the palm, incise this adhesion according to what is appropriate and improves the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On the cutting of haemorrhoids.
Haemorrhoids are twisted, thick, swollen veins filled with black, stagnant blood. They occur in most parts of the body, most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of those who carry burdens, such as porters, and those who work with heavy loads.  First, the body should be purged with black hellebore, several strong purgations.
Then, bleed the patient from the basilica vein. As for treating them with iron instruments, there are two methods: one is to incise and remove the black blood; the other is to excise the vein and remove it entirely. As for incision, this is the method: first bathe the leg well with warm water.
until the thick, turbid blood is loosened. Then tie the patient's leg from above his thigh to below his knee with a bandage. Then incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then squeeze out the black blood with your hand from the lower leg upward and from above downward, until you remove the amount of blood you consider sufficient, or as much as the patient's strength can bear. Then bind it and tell him to avoid foods that produce black bile.  Repeat the purging and bloodletting.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient.  As for excision, this is the method: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair. Then take him to the bathhouse and bathe his leg with warm water until it reddens and sweats, or until he performs strenuous exercise.
If a bathhouse is not available, heat the limb. Then incise the skin opposite the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or at its lower end near the heel. Then open the skin with hooks and dissect the vein from all sides until it is palpable.
When it appears, you will see it is dark red. When freed from the skin, it appears like a tendon. Then insert a probe under it until it is raised and emerges from the skin; hang it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then make another incision near that one, about three fingers wide.
Then dissect the skin from over the vein until it appears, then raise it with the probe as you did before and hang it with another hook as you did initially. Then make another incision, or many incisions if necessary.
Then dissect and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Then pull and dissect it until it emerges from the second incision. Then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until when it has all emerged, you cut it.
If it does not yield to pulling and dissection, insert a needle with strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull. Insert the probe underneath and twist it with your hand to each side until it emerges. Take care that it does not break; for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to dissect it.
And some harm will come to the patient from it. When you have dissected it all, place wool soaked in a potion and rose oil or oil on the wounds, and treat it until it heals. If the varix is constricted, with convolutions and a twist in different directions,
and is not straight as we said, then it is necessary to make an incision on it at each part of its convolutions and places of twisting, then hang it with hooks until you dissect it completely. Take care when incising it that you do not cut or injure the vein, for it will be difficult for you to dissect it, so be careful.
Image of the incision by which the varix is incised.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not be curved like other hooks, nor should it have a sharp point, lest it injure the vein. It should be thick, smooth, and curved, for if it is thin it will cut the vein with its thinness; rather it should have a considerable thickness, as we said.
Chapter ninety-one.
On the treatment of varicose veins.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, barren lands with little fertility.  It may also be generated in other parts of the body besides the legs, and its generation is from an infection that occurs under the skin.
Just as living creatures, worms, and gourd-worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh occur inside bodies, the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the place swells, and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that swelling.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal, so when its tip appears, it should be wrapped in a small piece of lead weighing from one dirham to two dirhams, and tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever something emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the remainder. Do not cut it from its root before it all emerges, for if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing swelling, infection in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be carefully and gradually pulled out until it is completely removed and nothing of it remains in the body.  From this vein, in some people, there may emerge something five to ten cubits long.
And it has reached me that it emerged from a man to the length of twenty cubits. If it breaks for you while you are treating it, then insert a probe into its hole and probe it thoroughly along the body until all that is in it of matter is emptied, and then treat the place with medication for some days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or in the leg itself, producing many openings, and from each opening a branch emerges. Treat it as we mentioned in the section and as previously described.
Chapter ninety-two.
Concerning the incision for the worm that is generated under the jaw and is called the cow's disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries the cow's disease because it frequently affects cows. It is a single small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh and moves throughout the body, ascending and descending.
It is perceptible to the sense as it moves from one member to another until it perforates the skin at some point and emerges.  Its formation is from the putrefaction of some humors, as happens with worms, snakes, and gourd-like growths in the abdomen.
Its harm is expected to be that if it moves in the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and emerge, destroying the eye. This happens frequently. If you wish to treat it and remove it, this can only be done when it is moving and perceptible to the sense.
It is necessary to tightly bind above and below it with a strong ligature, then incise over it and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you do not find it, apply cautery with fire to the area until you burn it. The greatest harm to be expected from it is its damage to the eye, as we have said.
If you see that it has reached the head near the eye, then bind tightly beneath it on the forehead, then incise over it and remove it.  The patient should be treated with purgative medicines to cleanse the body of bad putrefied humors, and should abstain from foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
Concerning the incision for the disease known as the nafar.
This disease, which in our country is called *nafar*, is a pain that appears in some of the limbs, then moves from one limb to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in the countryside. She bared her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the forearm. After a short time, I saw that swelling moving along the ulna like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
As it moved from one place to another, the pain disappeared from that place and settled in the shoulder. Then, after a short while, it ran through the rest of her body until it reached the other arm. Then she told me that it travels around her whole body, as I witnessed.
I marveled at the speed of its movement from one limb to another.  I had never before seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, except that I had seen a number of people whose pain moved from one limb to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
I judged that this was only because the woman was from the countryside, dry-bodied, and with visible veins; therefore, that moving wind was apparent to the senses. It should not appear in the same way in people of comfort and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels the pain, and if it appears to you visibly as we have mentioned, then bind above and below it with a bandage and incise it until that congested wind emerges, and cauterize the place.
If you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by purging the body and with things that dispel and disperse winds, such as the seeds of henbane and the seeds of squirting cucumber and similar medicines.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On extracting arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the places in the body where they lodge. As for their differences according to their types, there are large ones and small ones; there are hollow glass ones and solid glass ones; and there are those with three points and those with four points.
Some have barbs and some have splinters. As for those according to the organs in which they lodge, they are of two kinds: either the organs are principal hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like; if an arrow has lodged in one of these organs and you see the signs of death which I shall describe to you later, then you should avoid extracting that arrow from it, for death will overtake its owner in most instances. But if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  Among the signs of an arrow wounding the brain and penetrating the bone and wounding the membrane which is upon the brain, there is intense headache, drowsiness and dizziness.
But if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  Among the signs of an arrow wounding the brain and penetrating the bone and wounding the membrane which is upon the brain, there is intense headache, drowsiness and dizziness. and redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, convulsions, delirium, vomiting, and perhaps blood will come from the nostrils or ears; perhaps speech will be lost and the voice will be gone, and a white moisture resembling gruel will come from the place of the wound, and a watery liquid like the water of flesh will flow from it.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and from extracting the arrow if it has not been extracted. As for the signs if the arrow has struck the heart and is near the left breast, it will be felt as if it has been driven into something solid and not into something empty.
And perhaps the arrow will have a movement resembling the pulse, and black blood will flow from the wound, followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat and fainting; then know that death is inevitable.  A sign of the arrow wounding the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels which are next to the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes; he breathes heavily and desires to inhale cold air. If the arrow has struck the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it will be near the small ribs, and the breathing will be labored with intense pain.
He will sigh and all the members of the shoulders will move. If the arrow has struck the liver, intense pain will follow, and blood resembling the liver in its redness will come from the wound. If the arrow has struck the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food will come from the wound.
And its condition is apparent. If the arrow has struck the abdomen and become embedded in it, and something of the faeces, or fat, or intestine has come out of the wound which has been ruptured, then there is no hope of its treatment or of extracting the arrow. If the arrow has struck the bladder and urine comes out,
and something protrudes from it outwardly, and the pain becomes intense for the patient, then know that he is doomed. As for the other members, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar members, they are mostly unharmed.
This is so when the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned. And I will tell you some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows, so that you may thereby be guided in your treatment. That is that an arrow once struck a man in the canthus of his eye at the root of the nose.
Then I extracted it for him from the other side, below the lobe of the ear, and he recovered, and no harm befell his eye.  And I extracted another arrow for a Jew which had struck him in the lobe of his eye, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow had become hidden, and I only reached the small end which is attached to the wood.
And it was a large arrow from the composite bows, square-headed, smooth, without barbs.  The Jew recovered and no harm befell his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic.
And it was one with barbs. So I made an incision for him between the jugular veins, for it had sunk into his throat. So I gently worked at it until I extracted it, and the Christian was saved and recovered. And I extracted another arrow for a man which had struck him in the belly, and we judged that he would die from it.
But when thirty days or so had passed, and nothing in his condition had changed, I made an incision over the arrow and skillfully worked at it and extracted it, and he recovered and no harm befell him.  And I saw a man whom an arrow had struck in the back, and the wound had healed over it.
Then after seven years the arrow emerged at the root of her thigh. And I saw a woman whom an arrow had struck in her belly, and the wound had healed and the arrow remained, and nothing in her condition had changed, nor did she experience any harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man whom an arrow had struck in the face, and the wound had healed and remained, causing him little pain. And there are many such cases. And I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the Sultan's guards, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, inclining slightly to the right side.
And the whole arrow was hidden.  I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I explored it with a slender probe, but I did not feel it. And he felt a stinging pain under his ear on the right side of the incision.
I hoped that this stinging pain was from the point of the arrow, so I dressed the area with a dressing possessing drawing and ripening power, hoping that the area would swell and the arrow's location would become apparent so that I could incise it.  But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that location.
So I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened.  Then the wound closed during that time, and the patient despaired of its removal for a while, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me.  Then I applied a strong corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it and felt the thin tip of the arrow which adheres to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until the arrow tip became clearly visible to us.  And it took me about four months with this.
Then, when the wound widened and I was able to insert forceps into it, I pulled and moved it, but it did not respond to removal. I continued to gently manipulate it and devise ways with various instruments until one day I grasped it firmly with forceps, as its image is shown at the end of the chapter.
And the physicians judged that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I healed it, and the wound closed and the patient recovered completely, without any further harm. And I tell you the method of removing some arrows so that you may use this as a measure and example for those I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description nor encompassed by a book.  Rather, the skillful craftsman measures the much from the little, and from what is present to what is absent, and devises a new operation and a new instrument for strange emergencies.
If we descend to this craft, then I say that arrows are removed from the members in which they are embedded in two ways: either by pulling them from the place where they entered, or from the opposite direction; those which are removed from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, in which case it is pulled and removed. If it does not yield to removal at the time it is encountered, then you should leave it for some days until the flesh around it decays so that its extraction is easier.  This is also the case if it is embedded in bone.
And if it does not yield to removal, leave it also for some days and try again by pulling and moving it each day; then it will come out. If it does not yield to removal after several days, then you should bore around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine borer until you widen the opening for the arrow, then pull and remove it.
If the arrow embedded in the skull has penetrated deeply into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those symptoms I mentioned appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after some days.
…then proceed to pull out the arrow. If it is very firmly embedded and does not yield to pulling, use the borers around the arrow as I described to you, then treat the wound until it heals. As for if the arrow has disappeared into a place in the body… …and is hidden from view, then explore it with a probe. If you feel it, pull it out with some instrument suitable for pulling it out. If you cannot reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein…
…then incise it until the wound is widened and you can reach the arrow to extract it. If it has barbs, grasp them and carefully free the flesh caught in them from all sides by any means possible. If you cannot free the flesh, break off the barbs and twist them until you are free of them.
And when you attempt to extract the arrow from whichever place it may be, use the forceps in your hand, rotating it in all directions, to loosen it.  Be extremely gentle, lest the arrow break, making it difficult for you to pull and extract it. If you cannot manage it at once…
…leave it for some days until the flesh around it decays, then try again; it will then be easier. If you encounter bleeding, use the treatment mentioned in its chapter. Take great care not to cut a vein, nerve, or tendon; use skill.
By any means you can, loosen the arrow; let this be done gently, slowly and steadily as I have described to you.  It is necessary that when you pull out the arrow, you place the patient in the same position he was in when the arrow struck him; this is more appropriate.
If you cannot do that, use whatever positions you can. As for an arrow that exits on the opposite side, either some of it will have emerged externally, or you will be able to feel the tip of the arrow just beneath the skin and see it protruding.
Then make an incision, the length of which should accommodate the forceps, and then pull it out; it will be easier to remove. If it is stuck in a bone, rotate your hand until the arrow affects the bone and makes room for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days and then try again until it comes out. If the arrowhead remains, push it with it. If the arrowhead has fallen off and you wish to use pushing, insert the hollow instrument such that its cavity enters the end of the arrow and then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that fits into that cavity; this will make the arrow easier to remove.  If the arrow is poisoned, you should, if possible, completely cut away all the flesh into which the poison has penetrated, and then treat it with an appropriate remedy.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or flank, and is close enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision, then make the incision, being careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if it needs stitching, and treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps with which arrows are extracted:
Their ends are like a bird's beak; they are made like a file so that when they grasp an arrow or anything else, they do not let go.  Large, small, and medium sizes are made, each according to the size of the arrow, the width of the wound, and its narrowness.
Image of the hollow pusher:
Image of the solid pusher:
This has a solid end like an awl to facilitate its entry into and pushing of the hollow arrow.
Chapter ninety-five.
On phlebotomy.
The veins which customarily are opened in the body number thirty, of which sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the "whispering" veins, and the two arteries in the temples which are apparent, and the two veins at the inner canthus of the eyes, known as the "seeing" veins.
And the vein erect in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the tip of the nose, and the two jugular veins in the neck, and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins in the lower lip—these veins are known as the "veins of the throat"—and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins which are opened in the arm and hand, they are five veins; one of them is the cephalic, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head; and the median vein, which is the middle vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the basilic, which is situated on the inner side, and is also called the axillary, and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen; and the vein of the forearm, which is situated on the ulna, and to which it adheres, and which appears clearly above the thumb; and the salim.
And this is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger; it has two branches. And in the leg and foot there are three veins: one of them is that which is below the hollow of the knee on the outer side; and the second is the saphenous, and its place is at the heel on the inner side; and the vein of the sciatic nerve, and its place is at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins like them. As for the two veins which are behind the ears, the benefit of opening them is for chronic colds, migraine, ringworm, and chronic bad sores of the head, and the method of opening them is as I describe.
And that is to shave the head of the patient and rub his head well in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the two veins appear and their place behind the ears in the two lower parts of the head, then you feel them with your finger, and where you feel their pulsation under your finger, there you mark with ink.
Then you take a lancet-shaped knife, which is known as the *nashal*, then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the knife reaches the bone, then you raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin, a severed cut, and the length of the cut is the size of two joined fingers.
Or something like that, and you let out the amount of blood you want, then you bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal.  And I have already mentioned earlier in the book their cutting and cauterizing.  As for the two arteries which are in the temples, the benefit of opening them is for chronic migraine, severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp humors directed towards the eyes.
And the method of opening them is as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the veins appear clearly to the touch and their pulsation becomes apparent under your finger; then you mark with ink. Then you lift the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.
And you insert the *nashal* lancet from below and raise the vein upwards and sever it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out blood according to your need, then you loosen the patient's constriction and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then you place cotton and a bandage on it and bind it tightly from above and leave it until it heals.  I have already mentioned them, their cutting and cauterization, earlier in the book. As for opening the vein of the forehead, its benefit, after opening the vein of the nape, is for chronic facial ailments like ringworm, ulcers and erysipelas.
And the method of opening it, as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the vein appears, then you take the instrument called the axe, and this is its image:
You place the projecting spike which is at the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar, and you let the blood flow to the amount you want, then you loosen the patient's constriction and bind it until it heals.
It may also be opened with a broad lancet, except that the lancet should not be sharp-pointed like other lancets, but should be somewhat broad-ended, and you should open it obliquely, because the bone is near, and the lancet might break if it is thin.
As for the two veins which are at the temples, their benefit is for eye ailments such as ringworm, inflammation, and cataracts, and facial diseases. As for the method of opening them, it is that the patient constricts his neck with a turban, then you open them while you are standing over his head, and let the opening be slightly obliquely lengthwise with a small, somewhat broad lancet.
For there is no flesh in the location, for if the lancet is thin-pointed it might break.  Then you let out the amount of blood you need and place cotton on them and bind them for one night, then you unbind them. As for opening the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And severe headache and facial diseases like erysipelas which appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic.  The method of opening it is that the patient constricts his neck, then you grasp his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long lancet.
And you insert it into the middle of the nasal septum itself, between the nasal partitions, straightly, because the vein does not appear to the touch there, for the blood will emerge immediately. And you should move your hand with the lancet a little and let out the amount of blood you need, then bind it for a night, for it will congeal quickly.
As for the jugular veins, the benefit of opening them is for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases which appear on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, impetigo, bad ulcers, and cankers.  The method of opening them is that the patient constricts under them in his neck with a ligature, and the surgeon stands at the head of the patient.
And the patient sits on a chair, then you open the vein lengthwise, a slightly wide incision, then you let out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see as necessary. Then you do likewise with the other vein, then you untie the ligature.
And you tie the veins with a moderate tightness, lest the patient suffocate, and you leave him until the next day, for the wound will heal. As for the veins of the throat, the benefit of opening them, after opening the cephalic veins, is that it benefits from canker sores in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, cracking of the lips, and bad ulcers.
which are in the nose and around it.  The method of opening them is that you seat the patient before you and tie his neck with a turban, then you turn back his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see to the right of the lip and the other to the left of it, and you ascertain them by their blackness.
And that is also because around them are small, black veins, so cut them with a cutting incision. If it is difficult for you and you do not know what they are, then aim to cut the largest and most evident ones.  Likewise, do this in the two veins which are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins which are under the tongue, the benefit of opening them after opening the cephalic veins is for the inflammations which are in the throat from the disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth. The method of opening them is that you seat the patient in your hands facing the sun, and you lift his tongue and look under the tongue, on one side a vein and on the other side a vein, and their color is towards blackness.
Then you open them and be careful not to go too far in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, and perhaps bleeding from those arteries will occur. As for the three veins which are opened in the elbow, they are those which custom has decreed to be opened in all people, and their opening is in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, wind-shaped or olive-shaped lancet to the thinness, or by cutting with a scalpel, which is the lancet [and this is its image], the image of the wide, wind-shaped lancet:
It is wide, as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood. And this is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
And this lancet is less wide and thinner at the tip, suitable for opening thin veins which contain thin, bilious blood. And this is the image of the lancet:
This is the lancet which is suitable for cutting, and there are wide and thin types of it, according to the width and narrowness of the veins also. And by this, one may infer the rest, and it is well-known among the artisans.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from what is next to the chest and abdomen. It is necessary for the phlebotomist, when opening it, to beware and be careful, for beneath it is an artery. If he makes a mistake and goes too far in piercing with the lancet, he will cut that artery.
Then bleeding will occur; therefore, it is necessary that its opening should not be done with a lancet for piercing, but its opening should be done by cutting with the lancet.  If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to avoid it and turn to another, or seek one of its branches.
Or you may open in its place the vein of the arm, for it is clear, and cut it with the lancet as we said. If you wish to open it specifically, then before tightening the arm, it is necessary to feel the place until you identify the location of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then you tie the arm and cut the vein with an oblique cut with the lancet, as we said, and take care that the stroke falls far from the artery. And when you see, upon tightening the ligature, a swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, upon opening the vein, spurt like a boy's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery. Then immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops—and it often stops—then tighten the ligature.
And leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it, and let him be on his back and not move it for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and overcomes you and you do not have a remedy at hand, then amputate the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the blood will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, and take one half and bind it tightly to the vein with a ligature and pledgets until the next day. If the bleeding stops, well and good; otherwise, treat it with what was previously mentioned of applying styptics, and stopping its bleeding is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the tightness of the ligature on the arm, inform him of it. As for the median vein, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the upper head and lower body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
It is necessary for the one who opens it to be lying on his back when he opens it, for there is a nerve beneath it. If he goes too deep with the lancet and injures the nerve, numbness will occur in it which is difficult to cure, and perhaps it will not heal at all. This nerve is often palpable.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not apparent, then you should make your incision with a lancet and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for diseases of the eyes, and it is preferable in this vein especially, if you wish to open it, to make the incision with an olive-shaped lancet or with a broad, basil-shaped lancet because it is the safest of all veins, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
However, when bleeding, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft place. It does not harm if it is not hit with the first stroke to be bled again several times, except that it may swell in some people if it is not bled on the first stroke.
But that swelling does not harm it in any way. As for the method of bleeding, its complications, and what should precede its treatment, the first thing you should know is that bleeding is either used only to preserve health.
Or it is used in illnesses.  That which is used to preserve health and prolong it and to guard against the occurrence of illnesses is that the bleeding should be in one of the three veins in the elbow, I mean the cephalic, the median cubital, and the basilic, and that the bleeding should be at the beginning of spring if signs of fullness appear.
And the bleeding should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of the day have passed. As for bleeding which is used in illnesses, it does not have a limited time, but whenever necessity and need dictate it, whether by night or day.
And at every hour and at every time. Children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years of age be bled. If someone intends to bleed for any reason whatsoever,
he should cleanse his bowels before bleeding with a gentle enema if there is much retained excrement within, lest putrid superfluities be drawn into the veins from the intestines during bleeding, harming the principal organs.  And one who is anxious, or drunk, or intoxicated should not be bled until that passes from them.
And bleeding should also be avoided after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual intercourse, exertion, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental. Then, look at the thinning of the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
with foods, drinks, and medicines, if that is possible for him. Then, let him enter the bath, if nothing prevents him, or let him engage in some exercise so that the blood thins and make his bleeding in the middle of the day as we said, and let him aim to empty his chest that day of all bad psychological symptoms.
such as worries, anger, fear, and all physical symptoms like excessive exertion and effort, sexual intercourse, and the like. And let him prepare for his session the things that people customarily use, such as perfumes, fragrant herbs, entertainment, and the like, each person according to what he can manage.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion that is higher than the cushion on which the patient sits. Then the patient extends his arm, and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then tightens the ligature with the fillet and twists it two or three times. Let the tightening be moderate.
For if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, which prevents the flow of blood, or if it is relaxed, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then, after the tightening, it is necessary for the patient to rub both his hands together.
until the veins swell and become perceptible to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, then places the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself below the place he wants to bleed a little, lest the vein evade and avoid the incision. For some veins are like tendons, evading when being bled, and some are full of air, so when the lancet is placed on them, they sink beneath the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein, or if it does open it, it only opens it narrowly.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be certain and deliberate in all these matters, then lower the lancet. If the vein opens from that attempt, otherwise he repeats it again a little below or above that place quickly if the area is not swollen.
If the patient swells or is anxious, leave him for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage, for it may cause a hot swelling, and he should not enter the bath. Then he may resume bleeding if he wishes. If the lancet is inserted and the opening is small and the flow of blood is thin,
and you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, then return the lancet into the same hole gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly, and do that quickly before the area swells, for in many people the area may swell with a small opening.
If you see it has swollen, do not repeat it at all, for it will not help you. Put something of oil dregs on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood, and it is better in this situation than oil itself and other ointments as well.
Therefore use oil dregs in all your phlebotomies when the flow of blood is difficult.  The theriac and the shakhzanājā may also do this if one of them is placed on the area, for the blood will thin and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of the phlebotomy—and this often happens, especially to someone who has only been bled once or whose vein opening was small—then act quickly and place a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water on the swelling and bind it for an hour, for it will resolve.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has completely exited the vein itself or from another vein. If something black or green remains in the area after some days, it does no harm. If you wish, apply something of aloes and myrrh that have been dissolved.
Or something of the juice of the plant *fudanj* and the like. Often a swelling and a boil occur with phlebotomy of the basil vein. Place your hand on it; if you find that it softens when you touch it, then it is a bad boil, so be careful not to apply anything of what we mentioned.
For perhaps arterial blood will flow from it, but bind it with something astringent to constrict the area, then treat it with the other treatments until it heals. And it is necessary to extract from each person a quantity of blood according to his strength and the color that is predominant in the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it becomes red; and likewise, if you see that it is thick, let it flow until it thins; and likewise if it is acrid, until its acridity is gone. And it is necessary for someone who is full-bodied and strong and needs to have blood removed in one go...
...to widen the vein incision and the lancet should be wide. And for someone who is weak, the opposite should be done. And it is necessary that you extract it in several times, and that the opening be narrow. And the best thing to use in phlebotomy is something sharp, well-honed, incised, not pierced.
And this type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve; and it is better and safer than phlebotomy across or lengthwise. And if someone is accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, then it is necessary to feed him before phlebotomy something of bread soaked in pomegranate water or oxymel.
If he is feverish and blood is extracted from him three or four times, then if he has a cold temperament, let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in hydromel or in honeyed syrup flavored with herbs or in a pleasantly-scented syrup.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and its cause is the great loss of blood, then it is necessary to give him meat broth and thin, pleasantly-scented syrup; and he should be perfumed with galbanum, and his chest should be rubbed with it; and he should use everything else that we mentioned in the section on fainting.
which is due to vomiting. And as for someone who wants to relax his arm and to let his blood flow again, it is necessary for someone whose phlebotomy was for copious evacuation and whose strength is weak, that the blood be let little by little, according to his strength, on consecutive days.
And as for someone who wants to relax his arm and let his blood flow again, and his body is strong, let him do that after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy. And as for someone who wants to draw the blood from his body to the opposite side from which it inclined, then it is necessary to relax him on the second or third day.
And as for someone whose blood is abundant, has become hot and sharp, and has caused fever, then it is necessary to extract the blood from him in a single session and to extract a large amount, and to widen the opening until fainting occurs, after you have checked all the conditions for phlebotomy. And that you place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, lest death occur instead of fainting; for this often happens if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs.  And it is not necessary, if you want to loosen the arm and let the blood flow again.
And if the opening of the vein has closed and the exit of blood is difficult, do not prick it forcefully or twist it strongly, for that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you phlebotomize it again, or remove with the blade of the lancet what has solidified of blood in the opening of the vein.
Or apply something of salt dissolved in water, or apply something of theriac or  schechnaia, and prick it gently until the blood comes out.  If the vein is swollen, then leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity requires letting the blood flow again, then either phlebotomize above that place, or phlebotomize in the other arm or in another vein.
As for phlebotomizing the basilic vein, it is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic and basilic veins if they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.  Its method of phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly, then it is tied above it with a ligature, slightly and moderately.
Then phlebotomize the vein at a slight angle, neither across nor lengthwise, and let the opening be wide.  Your phlebotomy should be slightly above the joint of the hand. If the exit of blood is difficult, return the hand to the vessel of hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it reaches your need. If you are in the summer, you may dispense with returning the hand to hot water.  The use of hot water is most often done in winter. Phlebotomizing this vein is safest of all veins. Because there is neither a major vein nor a nerve beneath it. As for phlebotomizing the vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. Its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand, after putting it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is neither a major vein nor a nerve beneath it. As for phlebotomizing the vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. Its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand, after putting it in hot water until the vein swells. It becomes very perceptible to the touch. Then phlebotomize it at a slight angle. Even if you cut it completely, it will not harm him at all. Be cautious; do not plunge your hand with the lancet, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, and the location is bare of flesh. Then return the hand to the hot water.
And leave it to flow. If you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will congeal in the opening of the vein and cease flowing. When you have drawn the required amount of blood, apply ointment and salt to the vein, lest it close quickly.
And similarly you should do with every narrow branch. As for the benefit of phlebotomizing from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen; and you do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second, the same. As for phlebotomizing the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as uterine ailments.
And amenorrhea, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.  Its method of phlebotomy is that he puts his leg in hot water and massages it until the veins become prominent. Then you tie above the joint of the leg with a ligature; and the vein is located at the heel, externally, towards the great toe.
And many branches extend from it on the front of the leg. Phlebotomize in its widest branch, or at the heel where it converges; this is best and safest.  If you phlebotomize on the front of the leg, be cautious of the nerves beneath it on the front of the leg.
And make your incision as if you intend to sever it, and let the lancet be sharp. If the blood does not flow, let him return his leg to the hot water and leave the blood to flow until it is emptied. If the phlebotomist misses the vein on the first attempt,
let him try again a little higher, for the area is safe and nothing is to be feared if you are cautious of the nerve, as we said. Do the same with the saphenous vein of the other leg. As for the sciatic vein, its location, as we said, is at the heel on the outer side.
And its benefit is for hip pain, if that is from hot blood.  Its method of phlebotomy is that you put the patient in a bath, hurry, and bind his leg from the hip to above the heel by four fingers' breadth with a thin, long bandage; for it does not appear except in this way.
Then, when it appears, phlebotomize it however you wish, either by incision, which is best, or by severing it or by splitting it; for its location is safe, and it is very hidden in most people. If you do not find it,
and it does not appear at all to the touch, phlebotomize some of its branches, which appear on the dorsum of the foot towards the little finger and ring finger, being careful of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood you desire.
Then loosen the binding and place cotton on the site of phlebotomy and bind the area, for it quickly heals.
Chapter ninety-six.
Concerning cupping and its method of use.
Cupping instruments may be made of horn, wood, brass, or glass, and cupping is of two types: one with incision and evacuation of blood, and the other without incision.
And this cupping without incision is of two types.
And cupping of the sides of the neck on both sides, and cupping of the chin, which is below the lower jaw, and cupping of the shoulders, and cupping of the coccyx at the base of the spine, and cupping of the forearms, which are the middle of the arms, and cupping of the legs, and cupping of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the fine veins scattered in the flesh, and for that reason it does not weaken the body as much as bloodletting, and cupping, whether with fire or without, should not be used in any illness that results from fullness until the entire body is emptied.
If the need for cupping arises from illness or habit, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end, in the middle, or at any time.
That is because some people, when their blood increases to the point that it needs to be removed by cupping, feel heaviness and headache in their heads; and some feel fullness and redness in their face, head and neck; and some feel itching in their face and sides, darkness and burning in their eyes; and some itch at the site of their cupping.
And some laugh a lot, and some find the taste of blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit blood; and some sleep a lot; and some see blood, redness, slaughter, and wounds in their sleep, and things like that.  Whenever we see any of that, ...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours of the day have passed. As for the benefit of cupping the temples, it benefits from heaviness in the head and water pouring into the eyes.
But it should be after evacuation of the whole body. This cupping may be a substitute for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.  It is forbidden to use it for those who are cold-headed or have a cold, for it greatly harms them.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold diseases in their heads should not use it, and those who overuse it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, you should instruct the cupper to lower his hand with the cupping glass a little lower, for fear of forgetfulness being produced. As for cupping the nape of the neck, it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic and cephalic veins.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory organs, cough, and fullness. The cupping of the nape of the neck should be raised a little, because if it is lowered, it produces weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it benefits from headaches, ophthalmia, migraine, angina, and toothache. It is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic vein. You should instruct the cupper not to deepen his hand with the lancet, lest he cut a vein and cause bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it benefits from canker sores in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases in the mouth. It may serve as a substitute for phlebotomy of the jugular veins in the lips. As for cupping the shoulders, it benefits from palpitations that result from fullness and heat.
As for cupping the forearms, it benefits from what benefits phlebotomy of the three veins, the basilic, cephalic, and median cephalic, because it attracts blood from all those small veins in the flesh and attracts those small veins from other thicker veins until the attraction reaches the three thick veins.
You should instruct the cupper not to go too deep with the lancet, because the area is sparsely fleshed and underneath are nerves and arteries. As for the single cupping applied to the coccyx, it benefits from hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
You should instruct the cupper that the cupping glass should be large and made of copper, because the area requires strong suction and a glass cupping glass may break and require many incisions. As for cupping the legs, it noticeably reduces fullness.
Because it attracts blood from the entire body, it benefits from chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; it promotes menstruation; and it benefits from boils and abscesses.  It serves as a substitute for phlebotomy of the saphenous veins and the ankles, except that it weakens the body considerably and causes fainting in most people. The benefit of cupping the ankles is similar to the benefit of cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping glasses is that the cupping glass is first placed empty and moderate suction is applied. Do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors are drawn to the area evenly. Continue to repeat this until you see that the area has reddened and opened.
When the redness of blood appears, then make an incision and gently resume suction. Then observe the condition of the bodies.  If a person's flesh is thin and porous, then you should make only one incision, lest the area ulcerate.
Instruct the cupper to widen the incision slightly and deepen it, and to adjust the suction gently and with a slight movement. If the blood is thick, then two incisions should be made: the first to open a path for the thin, watery blood, and the second to thoroughly extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, repeat the incision a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to extract a small amount of blood, we are content with one incision; if we want to extract a large amount of blood, we make more incisions, especially if we judge the blood to be thick.
Therefore, we should make a deep incision; the moderate limit of the incision is only the depth of the skin. What ointments, waters, and things should be avoided by the cupper when applying cupping glasses? As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and whose pores are tight,
the areas for cupping should be anointed with opening, softening, and resolving ointments.  If it is summer, then use, for example, rose ointment, violet ointment, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
And if it is winter, then use, for example, narcissus oil, iris oil, chamomile oil, lily oil, and the like. If the waste matter is thick and cold, then let the ointment be marjoram oil,  or balm oil, or benzoin oil, or rue oil, and the like.
If the cupper has wide pores and soft flesh, then the ointment should be avoided. These people should wash their cuppings after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or gooseberry water, or gourd water, or chickweed water, and the like. As for someone whose blood is very moist,
he should wash his cuppings with vinegar, or with water of myrtle and sumac, and the like. As for someone whose waste matter is thick, he should wash his cuppings with old wine, or with marjoram water, or a decoction of rue, or chamomile, and the like. Cupping should be avoided in the bathhouse and immediately after the bathhouse.
Rather, it should be used an hour or two after leaving the bathhouse. No one should sleep after cupping. What the cupper and phlebotomist should manage before and after cupping.
First, it must be observed whether the cupper or phlebotomist is choleric, and if his blood is predominantly sharp and inflamed, then he should take cooling things like pomegranate, chicory with vinegar, lettuce, oxymel, sherbet, and the like.  He should make his foods of poultry and lamb stews, and sour things, and the like.
And if his temperament is cold, then he should be given honeyed drinks and oxymel, or seed oxymel, and he should consume moderately perfumed wine, which is between old and new. He should be ordered to eat little, and he should make his food of poultry, capons, birds, and young pigeons, stewed. The drink on the day of cupping and phlebotomy should be more than the food.
And it may be necessary to give some people at certain times some of the theriac of Avicenna, or musk medicine, or silphium before cupping and before phlebotomy, or after, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood.  It should not be given to those with fever.
As for cuppings which are without a condition, they are the cuppings which are placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, the region of the kidneys, and the hip joint, because these organs do not tolerate the condition being applied to them. Rather, what is intended by them is either drawing blood from one organ to another.
Such as placing the cupping glass on the breasts in a case of epistaxis, or we use it to remove a cold humor which has gathered in an organ, such as placing the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel, for it relaxes the organ, warms it, and removes the pain by resolving that humor.
And it may be placed on the kidneys if obstruction or stones appear in them, for by the strength of its drawing, it may perhaps open the obstruction or dislodge the stones from their place.  It does likewise if placed on the liver and spleen when a humor troubles them.  These cuppings may be used empty, only by suction.
And it may be used with fire, and it may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of inflammation.  That is to fill the cupping glass, and let it be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which some herbs suitable for this have been cooked.
Then it is placed full on the place, held, and removed, and repeated several times as needed. And this is the image of the cupping glass which is used with fire:
Its mouth will be the width of two open fingers, as we have pictured, and its depth about half a span; and in its side, about the middle, there will be a small hole, about the size that a needle enters. It is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, thick-rimmed.
Smooth, level, polished, lest it harm the member when placed upon it; and in its middle there will be a crosswise groove of copper or iron, where the burning candle is placed.  And this cupping glass may be made larger than we have described, or smaller, according to the illnesses.
And the custom of its use is that the cupping glasses for boys and thin people are not the cupping glasses for men and those of robust bodies. As for the manner of placing this cupping glass with fire on the member, it is that you prepare a burning wick of tightly-woven linen or a small candle of pitch and place it on the middle of the hardened rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass.
So that the ascent of the fire will be upwards towards the bottom of the cupping glass, lest it burn the body of the patient. Then it is placed on the member, and the finger on the hole which we mentioned, until, when we have held the cupping glass as long as we need, the finger is removed.
And the vapor will come out through that hole, and the cupping glass will adhere to the place. Then prepare the wick in the same manner, and replace it if you need to do so. As for the cupping glass which is used in the treatment of inflammation with water, it does not have a hardened rod or a hole.
But it is used by being filled with water and placed on the member only. And this is its image:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold much water, the better it is.
Chapter ninety-seven.
On the suspension of the leech.
Leeches are used mostly in cases where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because of smallness, like the lip and gum and so on, or because the member is bare of flesh, like the finger and nose and so on.
And the method of using them is that you should obtain leeches which are in fresh, clean water, free from impurities; then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and there remains nothing in their bellies. Then the body is first purged by bloodletting or cupping, then the affected member is wiped.
Until it reddens, then it is applied; and when it is full, it falls off. And if it is possible to cup the place, this is more effective; otherwise, wash the place with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and rub and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and this is a trickle, then let a linen cloth be moistened in cold water.
And place it on top until the trickle stops. If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or alum or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or apply halves of peeled bitter almonds to the place.
And leave it until the almond adheres to the place, for then the bleeding will stop. And it is advisable, if it is necessary to reapply leeches, not to reapply those leeches if others are available. And if the leeches refuse to attach, let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Or pierce a needle into the place until some blood comes out, then apply them; for when they sense some blood, they will attach themselves to the place. And if you wish to make them fall off, sprinkle on them some aloes, or salt, or ashes; then they will fall off in place.
Chapter Three.
On setting (bones).
This chapter also is from and concerning what is needed in the craft of medicine, which is the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, O my sons, that this chapter may be claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never consulted the books of the ancients in it, nor read a letter from them.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become nonexistent in our country, and indeed I have never encountered anyone at all skillful in it. And I have only derived what I have derived from my long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them, until I extracted knowledge of it from them, then I adhered to experimentation and practice for a long time.
And I have drawn for you from that in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience has passed over it after I have brought it closer to you and freed it from the branches of prolixity, and shortened it to the utmost, and clarified it to the utmost, and depicted for you in it many images of the instruments that are used in it.
For it is from the increase of explanation, as I did in the preceding two chapters, and there is no strength except in God, the Most High, the Most Great.
The first chapter.
In it are summaries and collections concerning the matter of fractured bones, which should be presented before we begin to mention the fractured and dislocated members one by one.  It is necessary that we mention in the beginning of this chapter a collection of sayings and sections. It compels you, first, to understand them and stand upon their truth, you and others who are eager to learn this noble craft.
So I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall happens to someone, it is necessary that you hasten first to bleed him or purge him, or both. Unless something prevents it, such as weakness, or the one to whom this has happened is a child or a very old man, or the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then restrict his diet to cold vegetables, the meat of birds and gazelles; and forbid him drink, thick meats, and overfilling of the stomach, and every food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling is safe and you do not expect the flow of material to the place.
Then let the patient return to his first regimen, which was his custom.  When the broken bone begins to knit, then the patient should be nourished with foods that nourish strongly, thickly, and solidly, which contain viscosity, like porridges, rice, heads, and necks, and cow tripe. And eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks and the like; for with this regimen the consolidation of the fracture will be quicker and better. And know that broken bones, if they are in strong men and old men, cannot ever unite and knit to their first nature.
Because of the dryness of their bones and their hardness. And it may unite and knit what was of bones in the extreme of softness, like the bones of small children. But nature grows on the broken bone from all its sides something resembling glue, thick in it, which adheres to it and tightens it until some of it adheres to some of it.
And it binds some of it to some of it until it comes to the extreme of strength and solidity as it was at first, until nothing hinders it from its actions.
For this reason it is necessary to give the patient food which contains solidity, viscosity, and thickness, as we said. And know that fractures differ in their types according to the difference of the members, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone.
And so all the other members, each is different from another. And we shall come to the mention of each type of fracture, explained in its chapter, detailed from another. And the type of bone fracture may also differ in itself.
For it may be its fracture a splintering without fragments occurring in it, and it may be its fracture along the length of the bone and its fracture has fragments and projections, separated and unseparated. And the fracture may be with a wound and perforation in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And for each type there is a special method in its setting, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And of what makes known a fracture of the bone is its crookedness, its swelling, and its appearance to the touch, and its roughness when you probe it with your hand.
Then when there is not in the place an apparent crookedness, nor roughness, nor do you feel upon touching the bone a disturbance, nor does the patient feel much pain, then there is no fracture, but it may be a sprain or a slight fracture or a slight crack.  Therefore, it should not be moved by pulling and probing at all.
Rather, apply to it of the medicines which the mention of will come after a while, what suits the place, then bind it gently. And know that if the bone is broken and split into two without fragments occurring in it, except that each part has moved from its companion.
Then it is necessary for you to hasten at once to its straightening and alignment before a hot swelling occurs to it.  If a hot swelling occurs to it, leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in whichever way you are able to with gentleness and skill.
And know that its setting and alignment is easier than a bone in which fragments have occurred. Then it is bound as will be mentioned.  If the bone has fragments, then it is necessary to pull the broken limb from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand. And let your placing of the limb be on a level surface in its natural shape, until when the broken part of the bone extends, then at that time return those fragments to their places in whichever way you are able to with skill and gentleness.
And exert yourself that you do not cause the patient pain or suffering by your action, and exert yourself to join one of the bones to its companion in the best manner. It is necessary at that time to touch and feel them with your hand; if you see there something contrary, correct and align it to the best of your ability.
And beware of strong pulling and forceful probing, as many ignorant people do, and they frequently cause by their actions a hot swelling or stiffness in the limb, as I have witnessed repeatedly from their actions.
Then, after the setting, perfection, and binding, keep that limb still and quiet, and warn the patient not to move it during his waking hours and sleep, and during his turning and restlessness, and during his defecation and all his movements to the best of his ability, and that he should strive to have the position of the limb in a position that ensures safety from pain.
And that is because, whenever he feels pain or discomfort in the position of the limb, he should move it to another position where he does not feel pain, and he should also strive to make that position level and straight.
Lest crookedness occur in the limb when it is healed.  As for the manner of binding the broken limb, it is as I describe to you. Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness and largeness and forms; those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and similar.
Then it is necessary that the bandages be soft and gentle; and those that are thick, like the thigh, back, and chest, then it is necessary that the bandages be wide and firm, because a wide bandage is necessary for a large limb and tightens it from every side with equal tightness so that no defect intervenes.
Then, after you have finished the setting, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. In a soft, pliable manner on the place of the fracture; then you begin to wrap the bandage on the place of the fracture itself three or four times, according to what the limb requires, and tighten your hand a little with the bandage, then take it to the upper side of the place of the fracture.
With less tightening than your tightening of the broken place, then you gradually spread the wrapping away from the place of the fracture a little and loosen the tightening little by little until you take something suitable from the correct place, then you take another bandage and wrap it also on the broken place.
wraps; then take the wrapping to the lower side of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the wrapping be as we mentioned in the first upper wrap; then place between the bandages from the soft pliable material or rags what straightens the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is crookedness, otherwise do not put anything in it; then wrap another bandage around it, then set on these bandages the firm splints at once if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, then apply what soothes that swelling and removes the inflammation, and leave it for some days, then tighten the splints on it at that time; and let the splints be from wide, carved, skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or let the splints be from sieve wood.
which are made from pine or palm leaflets or Arundo donax or  boxwood and the like of what is available, and let the width of each splint be in this way and this shape itself.
Except that the splint which is placed on the fracture itself should be a little thicker and wider than the other splints, and as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what suits the broken limb, large or small.  Image of the splint:
Then tighten the splints with another bandage, in the same way as your first tightening, then bind from above with strong threads, according to what we mentioned concerning the tightening, which is that your tightening should be more on the place of the fracture. And the further it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fineness, and let them be of wet linen especially, for if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by the ignorant, who make their threads from twisted linen strips, it is a great mistake.
Because the tightening with them is excessive, and thin threads are also unsuitable, because you will not achieve with them the tightening you want, and there should not be less than a finger's breadth between the splints.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after tightening in the healthy areas, place soft padding or fluffy wool underneath so that nothing harms him from that. As for if the fracture is with a wound and a rupture occurs in the skin, we will mention that separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be tightened with splints from the first day.  That is, if the limb is large, the splints should not be applied until after five or seven days, or more, depending on your assurance that hot swelling will not occur.
This is a description of the bandages with which the ancients used to bind fractures, dislocations, and wounds. A description of a common, brief bandage which sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is not excessively hot or cold.
It is that you take mill dust, which is the finest flour that adheres to the walls of the mill during the grinding process, and knead it as it is, without sifting it, with egg white, making the kneading neither thick nor thin, then apply it.
The description of another bandage which sets fractures, dislocations, and wounds: take of mastic, leadwort, acacia,  madder, tragacanth, and gum arabic, ten drachms of each; and of myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; and of  athel, twenty drachms; and of Armenian or Roman clay, twenty drachms. Pound everything together and mix with the water of athel, or with egg white if the patient's temperament is hot. Then use this bandage, for it is well-composed, quickly sets broken bones, and is suitable for most people because of its moderation.
The description of another bandage which is also useful for fractures and wounds: take tragacanth, mastic, and white lead, ten drachms of each; myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; acacia, six drachms; Armenian clay, twenty drachms. Pound everything finely, sift it, and knead it with water or egg white, and use it.
The description of a bandage for joints and bones dislocated from their places, which soothes the accompanying pain, and for bone fractures and breaks: take carded wool and dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply it to the area.  This bandage has no bone-setting power.
But it is excellent in soothing hot swelling and relieving pain in particular. The description of another bandage which sets broken bones: take the leaves of the deaf fig and the leaves of wild poppy, pound them together, and bandage with them while moist. The description of another brief bandage used when a bone fracture is being set.
And you want to resolve the remainder of the swelling, take of the root of white lead, chamomile, violet flowers, and crushed barley, one part of each; pound everything together and knead it with egg white if the member is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, knead it with coriander water or water, and use it.
The description of another bandage stronger in resolving than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs when setting a bone: take of the root of white lead, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, germander, violet flowers, and chamomile, one part of each.
Pound everything together and knead it with vinegar water, or with fresh water, or with egg white, all according to the heat of the member and the stillness of its inflammation.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken member when setting it.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil only, and he described it as being moderate between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he saw that things which contain gums with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, frankincense, and similar things that we mentioned, should be placed on the broken member when it is being set.
The description of a bandage that benefits weakness and pain: take myrrh, alum, human hair that has been cut or bird feathers, white lead, and salt, equal parts; pound, sift, and knead, and bandage with it. As for the amount that the bandage should remain.
Then it is loosened; that is to say, you should look; if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place occurs in the affected area, do not loosen it for many days; but if severe itching, troublesome pain, or swelling occurs in the place.
Then hasten to loosen it immediately and do not delay that at all, and remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft rag or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside. Then leave the member to rest for an hour.
Then apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil and bandage it for a night, until you are safe from hot swelling, the swelling of the member subsides, and its pain goes away. Then return it to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not tighten it as tightly as the first time.
And be gentle with it until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness, and all the symptoms have completely gone, and you need a bandage and tightening, then prepare it as you did at first, the same. If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs in the member.
Then do not loosen it except after three, four, five, or seven days, and it may be left for twenty days; all this depends on what appears to you of the condition of the member, as we said, until the fracture is set and the flesh begins to knit over it.
Then also increase the tightening more than your first tightening, and also increase the richness of the patient's food to what was previously mentioned. If you see that the place of the fracture has dried out and wasted more than it should, then know that food is prevented from reaching it.
Then bathe it with lukewarm water each time you loosen it, and let this be every three days, and lessen the tightening a little. For by this action, nourishment flows to the member, and it heals quickly. As for what ignorant bone-setters do, of breaking the member again,
if it is not set properly at first, and it is set crookedly, this is a mistake in their action and a great deception. And if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and acted upon it, and I have not seen any trace of it from any of them at all. And the correct thing is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
On accidental fractures in the head.
The types of accidental fractures in the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and this may either sever the bone completely until it reaches the membrane under the bone. Just as the wedge does in wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called wedge-shaped.  Or, the sword may cut some of the bone and sever only its surface, without the cut penetrating to the end; this type of fracture is called a complete avulsion. The wound in both of these fractures may be either large or small.
And some fractures are comminuted or depressed; their cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone or something similar. This fracture may either penetrate nearly to the membrane under the bone, or it may be only on the surface of the bone.
The wound in these two fractures is also either large or small. And some fractures are hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair, being a slight fissure.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called hairline.  And there is a fracture which results from a fall or a blow with a stone or the like; it drives a section of the bone inwards, and the location becomes concave, as happens to a copper vessel when struck, so that a part of it is driven inwards.
This occurs most often in the heads of young children, where the bone is soft. All these types of fractures may have loose and non-loose fragments. We will describe the treatment of all of them in their proper place, and we will identify all these types of fractures by examining them.
And examining them with probes and removing the corrupted flesh from them. As for the hairline type, it is known by examining the bone, wiping it, and smearing it with ink; then the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of the fracture, first look to the symptoms of the patient.
If you see among his symptoms that which clearly indicates fear, such as vomiting bile, distension, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, protrusion and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient nor treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
But if you see symptoms that do not frighten you and you hope for his safety, then begin his treatment.  And if the wounded man comes to you at the outset of his injury, and this is in the winter months,
then you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case. And if it is in the summer months, then you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone is corrupted, and those symptoms that we described appear.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is crushing and bruising, then you should cut away the crushed and bruised part as I describe to you; and that is to shave the head of the wounded patient.
And uncover the bone in whichever way is possible for you and according to the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If, when uncovering the bone, you find bleeding or hot swelling, then treat that as is appropriate.
And that is to pack the area with cloths soaked in a potion and rose oil, and clean the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then begin to chip away at the bone and remove it; this can be done in one of two ways.
As for the first method, it is to cut the bone with a delicate saw with a narrow blade, and this is its image:
Then you use another saw after this one, slightly wider; and this is its image:
Then you also use another saw, wider still than the second.  It is necessary that you have a number of different saws, some wider than others, and some shorter than others, and that they be extremely sharp at their edges, and let them be of Indian steel or good tempered steel.
And use gentleness in applying the saw, lest you shake the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and solid, then it is necessary that you pierce around it before using the saws, with the drills which they call non-immersive drills; and indeed they are called non-immersive drills.
Because they do not go beyond the limit of the skull bone to what is beyond it, because the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a small ring or circle, preventing it from penetrating and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
And it is necessary for you to take a large number of these drills, each one suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you will have for every skull a drill whose sharp point is in length and shortness according to the thickness of that skull. And this is an image of three types. of the drills: large, medium, and small.
As for the method of drilling around the fractured bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then you move the drill to another place, and you make the distance between each hole the amount of the thickness of an awl or similar.
Then cut with the cutters between each two holes, and do that with the utmost gentleness you are capable of, as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with something else from some of the instruments that you have prepared for that.
such as forceps and gentle hooks. And it is necessary that you take the utmost care that the drill or cutter does not touch anything of the peritoneum. Then, if you have removed the bone and it is free from the peritoneum, if it was adhering to it, and you have taken it out, then it is necessary to cleanse it.
And smooth the roughness of what remains in the bone with another instrument resembling the cutter, except that it should be thinner and gentler than the other cutters.  If anything remains of the small bones and fragments, then take them gently with what you have of instruments.
Then you treat the wound afterwards with cauterization and ointments, the mention of which will come. As for the other method of working, it is a very easy method, far from danger, Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly. And this is what he said. It is necessary for you first to begin by uncovering the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and evident, until, when you have uncovered that part, you place under it the tip of this lenticular cutter, and this is its image:.
Its lenticular part will be smooth, not cutting anything, and its sharp part will be on its sides going lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the peritoneum and the face of the sharp cutter on the bone, then you strike the cutter from one side.
With a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently as it turns, and you are safe from the membrane, nothing frightening happening in it at all, even if the surgeon were the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were sleepy.
If anything of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some parts of the bone, then scrape it off with the tip of the lenticular cutter itself and carefully free it from it, for it will be freed from it without harm or fear.
But if the fracture of the bone did not penetrate to the membrane, and what was broken of the bone was its surface, and roughness and small fragments remained in it, then it is necessary to remove that roughness and extract those fragments with delicate forceps, of which several sizes have been made, so that you can use the most suitable and appropriate one in each place, according to what the work leads you to.
And the same broken bone and its shape, and it is necessary that you use first in your scraping of the bone the widest of those forceps, then use after it a finer one, and continue to do that successively until you come to use the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small, hair-like fissures and slight fractures, it is necessary to use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its healing; this is something not hidden from anyone who has the least experience in this art and has understood what we have written and explained in large fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you extract the bone, then you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. And soak it in syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do this as gently as you can so as not to burden the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage on top and do not tighten it except to the extent that it only holds the wound.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are certain that the hot swelling has subsided, then remove it and use afterwards medicines that have a drying effect, such as the roots of iris, crushed gallnuts, crushed myrrh, and zedoary, and the like.  This is done by making plasters from these medicines.
And sprinkle them on the wound as they are dry. In general, use a medicine that cleanses and does not sting, and strive during your treatment of the wound that it be clean, free of oil residue or dirt, and do not allow pus to collect in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, causing great harm to the patient.  This may occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
Blackness on its surface is observed. If the patient shows the symptoms we have mentioned, know that he will inevitably perish.  However, if the blackness resulted from a medicine placed on it, and it was in the nature of that medicine to cause that blackness.
Then you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, and mix them well, and spread them on a cloth, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the various appropriate treatments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the reduction of a broken nose.
Know that only the upper two parts of the nose, or one of them, can be broken, because they are bones, for the lower part is cartilaginous and does not break; rather, contusion, crookedness, and flattening occur to it.
If one of its parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture from the inside with your index and thumb from the outside, until you return the nose to its natural shape. Let this be done gently by you, being careful not to cause the patient pain by your actions.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be straightened with the end of a probe of slight thickness. If the fracture is on both sides, do likewise.  And let it be treated on the first day of the fracture.
If possible; otherwise, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot swelling has subsided, then insert a tent of linen cloth into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or insert two tents if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the tents be of a thickness to fill the nostril. Some early bone-setters mentioned that the tents should be moistened with fat and changed every day. I do not think this is so; rather, the tents should be moistened with egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the tents until the bone is set and the cartilage is hardened. Goose quills, after being wrapped with soft linen cloth, may be inserted into the nose at the location of the tents; this will make the retention of the nasal fracture firmer and will prevent the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not necessary; you may do it or you may make tents. If hot swelling occurs in the nose during your work, apply a compress to the nose with  kypros or with cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or something of diachylon ointment.
If hot swelling does not occur, you should dress it externally with fine semolina and fine frankincense mixed with egg white, and then place a soft compress over it. Do not bind the nose at all if the nasal bones are fractured slightly.
Or if they are shattered, you should make an incision over them and remove them with the appropriate instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with appropriate ointments that promote healing and closure.  If a wound occurs inside the nose, you should treat it with tents and use lead tubes. until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the setting of lower jaw fractures.
If the lower jaw is fractured, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then if the fracture is only external and not broken into two parts, and is not depressed inwards, then its identification is easy.
If the fracture is in the right side, then the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is in the left side, then the index finger of the right hand should be inserted, and the elevation of the fracture should be gently raised from the inside outwards.
With your other hand from outside the bone, you control it to straighten it. If the fracture of the jaw has been broken into two, then it should be manipulated from both sides in a straight line until it can be straightened. If it has affected the teeth, they will loosen.
Or if they separate, then tie what you hope will remain with a gold, silver, or silk thread; then place a compress on the fractured jaw, then place a folded cloth on top of it, and place on the cloth a firm large splint or a piece of leather from a sole equal in length to the jaw. Then tie it from above according to how you can best tie it and how it matches the setting, so that it does not come undone. Order the patient to be patient and still, and give him soft liquid food. If you think that something has changed in its appearance in any way, then hasten to undo it on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to how you can best tie it and how it matches the setting, so that it does not come undone. Order the patient to be patient and still, and give him soft liquid food. If you think that something has changed in its appearance in any way, then hasten to undo it on the third day. Then you may repair what you have bandaged with mill dust mixed with egg white or fine semolina after removing the compress, and place a soft pad on the bandage. As long as that bandage adheres to it and the condition of the bone does not change, leave it.
Do not untie it until it heals and the fracture solidifies. Often this fracture solidifies in three weeks. If a hot inflammation occurs during that time, use what we have repeatedly mentioned to soothe it until that inflammation subsides.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, look: if a fragment or fragments of bone have become detached, then gently remove those fragments with whatever instrument suits you for their removal. If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as much as you need.
Then, when you have removed those fragments and none remain, stitch the wound opening if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for that purpose. And stitch the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of the clavicle if it is fractured.
The clavicle is most often fractured in the front, at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture is of one of three types: either it is broken into two without splintering, which is easiest to set;
or splinters are produced in the fracture, which is more difficult to set; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound. The procedure, if the fracture is without a wound, is that you should prepare two assistants, one to hold the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other to extend the neck towards the other side.
Then you set the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is neither projection nor irregularity. If you need more extension, you should place under the armpit of the patient a ball of rags or wool.
Its size should be according to your need. You extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set as it should be. If you are unable to pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has gone inwards, then the patient should lie on his back.
And a moderately sized cushion is placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downwards until the clavicle which is deep rises upwards. Then you set the fracture and align it with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the clavicle has broken and is moving, you should make an incision upon it and remove that splinter gently. If the splinter is embedded in the bone, you should try to cut it with one of the cutting instruments which you have prepared for that purpose. After placing under the clavicle the instrument which supports the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a curve.  Its width should be according to the size of the bone, large or small, and its length should also be according to what is possible for the work. Let it have two ends, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound which you incised when removing the bone splinter is wide and you are sure that there is no inflammation, then join the edges of the wound with sutures. If the wound is small or you fear inflammation, then dress the wound with lint and bandages to the extent of the incision.
If inflammation occurs, moisten the lint with rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it. As for setting a bone which is without a wound or incision, you should apply to the bone a plaster made from mill dust and egg white. And you place soft toweling on it, then you place a ball under his armpit if he needs it.  Then take a bandage which is very long, and its width is a cubit or so, then apply a folded bandage over the toweling and the plaster, then take a splint of thin wood. Let its width be three fingers and its length likewise. Then wrap it in a cloth, then wrap that cloth together with the splint in the part of the bandage which lies on the place of the fracture, then tighten the bandage on the fracture as it goes around. And pass it over his neck and under his sound armpit and under his injured armpit, and pass it repeatedly on each side, and as you see that the tightening secures the fracture firmly, which is not hidden from you.
And the point of all this is that the splint does not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should check on the patient every day; whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, correct that and tighten the bandage. Then let the patient sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
So that his arm may be raised from his side, and the clavicle fracture will be raised by raising the shoulder; or tie his arm to his neck. And do not untie the bandage unless something happens at the site, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. And leave it bandaged until the clavicle fracture heals and consolidates, and it will become stronger in twenty-eight days. And it may be in less time for some people.
Chapter Six.
On setting a broken shoulder.  The shoulder rarely breaks in its wide part; rather, its edges break.  When a part of it breaks, or it breaks in its middle, this is known by touch, and the treatment varies according to the nature of the fracture.
Straighten it and restore it to its natural shape by any means you can, then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft tow, and place on top of this a folded cloth pad. Then apply a wide splint of wood.
A splint as wide as the whole shoulder, or a little wider. If, under the splint, there is a roughness in any part of the shoulder, smooth out that roughness with soft tow until the splint lies evenly, then bind it above with a long bandage.
Bind it firmly and ensure that the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage each day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place. Let the patient lie on his sound side. A shoulder injury heals in twenty [days].
days or twenty-five days. When this period is complete, remove the bandage safely, for it is among the bones which are not feared for shattering or displacement. If a splinter of bone protrudes and is irritating under the skin, then incise over it and remove it. And do what was mentioned in the treatment of a clavicle fracture to alleviate the hot swelling if anything of that occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of a fracture of the chest.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, though this rarely occurs; but its extremities are more frequently fractured and shattered. Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and there occurs severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
And perhaps blood is expelled and the depression in the fractured bone is evident and not hidden from touch.  Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are compressed and the ribs are drawn together by hands from both sides, and gentleness is used in straightening it in every way possible.
And continue until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be, then apply a bandage and a splint, and place over it a splint of thin wood from willow or elm or something similar that is light, after wrapping it in cloth. Then gently bind it to the fractured bone lest it shift, and pass the bandage around to the back repeatedly and tighten it firmly.  Then examine the bandage frequently, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity dictates its removal because of suppuration that occurs in the area, or pain, or swelling, then hasten to remove it and take off the bandage, and treat what has occurred according to its treatment, then reapply the bandage if you see fit. And face it and maintain firm pressure until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
Concerning the treatment of fractured ribs. Know that fractures of the ribs occur in the thick parts near the back, and their ends in front are subject to contusion because they are cartilaginous.  The knowledge of this is not hidden from the sense when examined with the fingers.
And its treatment is to set the fracture with the fingers in the accessible way until the shape is even as it should be. Then bandage and bind the fractured bone with a splint if it needs it. If the fracture of the ribs is inclined inwards, then severe pain occurs to the patient.
And it sinks like the sinking which occurs to one with a lung puncture, because the bone penetrates the diaphragm.  There also occurs for him shortness of breath, coughing, and the expulsion of much blood. This is difficult to treat, and the ancients devised many methods for it.
And some of them said that it is necessary to give the patient food which produces flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen swells and expands, and the fracture is driven outwards. And we dislike this lest it strengthens the occurrence of hot swelling if it has not occurred.  If it has occurred, then it increases it and strengthens it.
And some of them said a cupping glass should be placed on the place, then strongly sucked. This is more similar to the correct approach, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will draw impurities to the place in its weakened state. And some of them said that the place should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
And a bandage is made between the ribs until it is full, so that the binding is even when it is wrapped around. Then the patient is treated with the treatment of a lung puncture, in terms of diet and medicine, if the patient is overwhelmed by a severe matter that he cannot bear. And the bone had penetrated the diaphragm in a harmful way, and we feared for the patient.  It is necessary that we incise the place and uncover the fractured rib, then we place under it the instrument which protects the peritoneum, which has been previously described, and we cut the bone gently and remove it.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitching and we treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling appears during this, then act quickly: wet bandages in rose oil, place them on the place, and treat the patient with what relieves the swelling from the inside as well.
And he lies on the side on which sleep comes easily to him until he is healed.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture affects them—and this rarely happens to them, and what happens more often is contusion—and similarly the vertebrae of the back also, if this happens to someone and you wish to know whether it will heal or not. Then look; and if you see that his hands have become relaxed and numb and dead, and he is not able to move them, nor extend them, nor flex them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle, he does not feel it and finds no pain in them, then know that in most instances he will not recover; he is doomed.
But if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking in them, then know that the marrow of the bone has been spared and that the patient will recover with treatment.  If the vertebrae of the back are similarly affected and you wish to know whether it will heal or not,
look at his legs; and if you see that they have become relaxed and what happened in the hands has happened in them, then if he lies on his back, wind and faeces are passed involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine is passed involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is doomed; do not trouble yourself with his treatment.  If none of this occurs to him, the matter is less serious. The treatment of what has happened is to try to relieve the hot swelling.
By placing on the injured vertebra rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks; apply this three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the area one of the strengthening, drying compresses, and bind it tightly, and order him to remain still and quiet.
And let him sleep only on the side where he feels no pain until he recovers. If, when the bone was injured, a splinter or something has been broken off from it, then it is necessary to incise the skin and remove that bone. Then bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the rump bone, is broken, then you should insert the thumb of the left hand into the rectum.
And set the broken bone with the other hand, as much as you are able and as the setting allows, then apply a compress and splint to it, if that is needed, and then bind it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, then incise it and remove it, and treat the wound with the treatment previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture; but if they do fracture, it is in that their extremities are shattered, they split lengthwise, and they incline inwards.  The patient experiences pain in the area, numbness, and a loss of feeling in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its treatment is that you pass your hand over it until you ascertain the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only in the extremities, then set that fracture as well as you can until it resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise or has inclined inwards, lay the patient on his stomach so that you may set the fracture. When you have set it, apply a dressing and then place a splint of wood or leather upon it and bind it tightly.
Do not fear displacement of the fracture or the splint coming loose. Fill in any hollows in the hips with padding so that the binding is even. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his healthy side. If there is hot swelling,
desist from setting it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply what will soothe it as described above, then return to setting and binding it properly. If there are splinters or fragments of bone, do not attempt to remove them.
They should not be touched but smoothed from the outside as we have said, and the binding should be left in place until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the setting of a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, it is set in one of two ways: one is to take a smooth, curved piece of wood of moderate thickness, in this manner:
And you tie two bandages to its ends, then it is hung from a high place and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the wood until his armpit is touching the middle of the curve of the wood, then something heavy is hung from above it.
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with both hands until he returns the fracture to what is appropriate. The other method is that the patient lies on his back and his hand is hung from his neck with a bandage.
Then you order two servants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands and the other to hold below it, and each stretches to his side. And if you want the stretching to be stronger, then tie below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the servants stretches them to his side.
If the fracture is near the end of the shoulder, then the middle of the bandage should be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.  Likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, then the bandage should be in that place and on the elbow itself.
Then the fracture is set gently without violence, until the fracture is set as it should be and unites well. Then you bind it if no hot swelling appears. If hot swelling appears, then leave binding it until the seventh day, and place on it soft wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then bind it. The method of binding is to place the bandage on the fracture, then place a bandage of new cloth over the bandage, then place the arm on the upper arm itself and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And you apply the cloth and binding to the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you and nothing changes in the broken bone. If you fear that something will change, then use splints.
This is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let there be the width of a finger between each splint.  And let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an increase of three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tightening that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your tightening on the place of the fracture be stronger.
And the further from the fracture, the less the tightening. If you see that the placement of the splints and the tightening, as we said, is appropriate at the time of your setting the limb, then do so.
And if you fear hot swelling, leave off the tightening and the splints until the seventh day, as we said. Then examine the bandage every three days, lest there occur in the place chafing or swelling, or the nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb because of excessive tightening.  Then correct all that according to what we have mentioned.
But if you are confident that none of that will happen, then do not loosen the bandage except after many days. And let the patient lie on his back and his hand on his stomach, and a cushion filled with wool, moderately full, be placed under the arm.
And examine at every time, night or day, lest the shape of the broken limb be disordered or the bandage become loose.  Then correct all that with your effort.  And make the patient's diet of the kind we presented earlier, that the food be light at first, until the bone is about to consolidate.
Then it is necessary to make his food more substantial. For it is the nature of the arm and leg to consolidate in forty days. Then it is necessary to loosen [the bandages], and he should use the bath and be treated with ointments suitable for that. If the fracture is severe and comminuted,
then do not loosen the bandage from him until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the ulna; one is small, which is that next to the thumb, and the other is large, which is situated under the small one from below.  So perhaps the larger ulna is broken alone, or the smaller one alone, and perhaps both are broken together.
When the smaller upper ulna is broken, then its setting is easy and its healing is quicker. When the lower ulna is broken, its fracture is bad and its healing difficult. And the worst is if both bones are broken. If the bone which is broken is the smaller upper ulna,
the physician should, when setting it, make its extension gentle and easy until he straightens it. If the larger ulna is broken, then he should make its extension stronger. And if both ulnas are broken, then he should make the extension much stronger.
And it is necessary that the shape of the hand, when it is set and extended, be placed stretched out on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers, and the little finger lower than the rest of the fingers, and the patient should sit squarely upon himself.
And let the cushion be at a suitable height for him, so that the patient does not suffer hardship.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends from above likewise. Then the physician straightens the bone until he restores it to the best shape he can. If there are fragments in the fracture of the bone, then they are removed.
Return each fragment to its place to the best of your ability. If a fragment appears that is separated and is piercing the skin, and there is no hope of setting it, then make an incision upon it and extract it in the manner that we have previously described. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then this has been dealt with separately in a chapter.
Then take the treatment for that from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your setting, then apply a compress of kyrotos (prepared with rose oil and white wax). Let it be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.  Bind the compress gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the kyrotos and apply the prepared bandage of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints. Let the splint that is placed upon the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger. And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases.
Whether the fracture was in one radius or in both radii, then make your binding at the site of the fracture stronger and tighter. And whenever you turn the binding upward or downward, make the binding slightly looser, as previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the compresses that are wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not very hard. And let the thread with which it is bound be of fine linen, of medium thickness as we have described. And check the limb and bandage after a few days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as itching that appears in the limb, then the limb should be bathed with warm water until that itching subsides.  And the limb should be left unbound for a night so that it may rest, then the binding should be resumed.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or something like that, then correct all of that to the best of your ability. And look also, if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness, then it should be loosened slightly and left for a few days until nourishment flows to it, then tighten it.
If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs to the patient, then it should not be unbound except after twenty days or so. Then, suspend the patient's hand to his neck, and let his arm be straight. He should be careful to avoid restless movements, and let him sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days; all that depends on the conditions of the temperaments and the conditions of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of a fracture of the palm and fingers.
Fractures of the metacarpus and phalanges rarely occur, but contusions occur frequently.  Therefore, when a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand…
The patient should sit cross-legged, with a chair directly in front, level with him.
Then he should place his hand upon it, extended. Then the surgeon should extend the broken bones and set them, until they are well-aligned. Then, if there is no hot swelling, a bandage and a splint should be applied; then a further splint should be applied over the top, according to the location.
And it has been placed in a soft cloth. If the fracture is towards the palm, make a kind of ball from a cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with his broken hand, then tighten it with a long cloth.
The splint should be made of soft leather, so that it conforms to the skin with the flexion of the entire hand, and it should be tightened appropriately. If the fracture is to the outside, a splint should be placed on top and another below in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight.
Then the bandage should be applied as the hand rotates, and the fingers should be interwoven with the bandage. If the fracture affects one of the finger phalanges, if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as necessary and then bandaged with the hand; and if you wish, you may make a small, upright splint to support the fracture.
And it should not move. If the fracture is to the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, they should be straightened and bound with the adjacent healthy finger, or all bound together, which is better, or a small, upright splint should be placed on them.
As we said concerning the thumb, and examine during and after your setting for hot swelling; counteract it appropriately whenever such a thing occurs, as described repeatedly.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone frequently breaks and is apparent to the touch, because it moves forward and backward.  Its treatment is to tightly bind a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below it, the patient lying on his stomach.
Then each bandage is extended to its side evenly. This is if the fracture is in the middle of the bone; but if it is near the head of the femur, then it is necessary to bind a soft bandage, either of wool or similar material.
At the head of the femur towards the pubis, so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural form.
And the bone unites well. Then it is necessary to maintain the bandage and binding, if no hot inflammation occurs in the limb. But if inflammation occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot inflammation subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for binding it, it is necessary to wrap a firm, wide bandage around the fracture two or three times, leaving some remaining. Then the leg is twisted until the heel is at the origin of the buttock, and a long thread is inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, the ends of the thread being above on both sides.
Then wrap around the leg and thigh what remains of the bandage. Then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and place one splint on the leg bone. Then stuff the space between the thigh and leg with soft cloths so that the binding is even.
Then begin strong binding from the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns; and the farther the bandage is from the site of the fracture, the less, softer, and looser should be your binding.
Then take the ends of the thread which you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie with it the adjacent splints from above; then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the heel of the foot, and with them also tie the ends of the splints from the other side.
Lest the bandage should shift from its place. Then leave the binding as it is as long as no pain, swelling, or puffiness, and the like, occurs in the limb. If any of that happens, hasten to unbind it and remedy whatever has occurred, as we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a protruding splinter in the bone, it should be set, if possible; otherwise, incise over it and extract it, and treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.  This fracture of the thigh may be bound without the leg being included in the splints.
As we mentioned in the case of the humerus and forearm, except that its setting in this way does not result in lameness for the patient. But if it is set alone without including the leg, then the patient will inevitably limp forever.
Know that the thigh heals in fifty days, or a little more or less; all this according to the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the fracture of the kneecap.
Fracture of the kneecap is rare, but it is often contused. If it is fractured, it will be either a fissure or a shattering into fragments, and this occurs with or without a wound.
You will ascertain all this by touch, and its reduction is to align the separated fragments with the fingers until they are joined and united, as far as accuracy, gentleness and skill allow.  Then apply a dressing and a circular splint if necessary.
Then tighten the bandage appropriately, and treat all the conditions we described for other fractures, such as acute inflammation, etc., by countering each symptom with the appropriate remedy until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the reduction of leg fractures.
The leg has two bones; one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg will be displaced in all directions; if only the thinner bone is fractured, the leg will be displaced forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured, and this happens lower down, it is something that will not escape your notice.
So use traction and reduction, and apply splints accordingly, except that if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, the traction should be less and gentler, and you should take great care in its treatment.
And in treating the leg there is something additional to the treatment of the arm: when you have set the splints and completed all your work, take two thin pieces of pine wood, of the kind used in plastering rooms, which are placed between the cracks in the planks, or [take pieces] from palm tree stalks or similar material.
Choose pieces of moderate thickness, not too thin, and let their length be that of the leg from the knee downwards. Then wrap each one twice around its length with a cloth, and place one on each side of the leg.
Let them extend from the knee to the bottom of the foot, then tie the two pieces of wood in three places: at the ends and in the middle. By this binding, the leg will be prevented from tilting to either side, and will be well supported.  A wooden gutter along the length of the leg may also be used.
It is placed in it to keep it from moving, and it is most necessary to do this in fractures accompanied by a wound, especially. Then examine the leg every day and give it meticulous care regarding swelling, inflammation, or anything else. If any of these things occur, treat them appropriately until healing is complete.  A leg bone mends in about thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the fracture of the bones of the leg and toes.
As for the heel, fractures never occur there; as for the bones of the leg, fractures may occur there, and as for the toes, fractures rarely occur, but contusions are more common.
If a fracture occurs in the bones of the leg and you see that some of those bones have overlapped, let the patient place his foot flat on the ground as if walking, then you stand and place your foot on the elevated part of those bones, then press down and set them.
until they return to their places, then apply a bandage and splint from above, and place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot, then bind the foot tightly after wrapping it with cloths and everything else it needs.
If three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage; you will find the bones straight, whether they were broken or dislocated.  The procedure is as you see. As for if some of the toes are broken, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you in setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken toe along the length of the toe, and let it be slightly wider than it, then place under the foot the board that I described to you and bind it tightly. If what was broken of the bones was two or three or more,
then make for each toe a splint of appropriate size, layered in soft cloth, and tighten the board at the bottom of the foot; and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to hold it firmly in place.
And you should not forget to attend to all that we mentioned to you in other fractures, from the symptoms that we mentioned, and treat each symptom as it should be.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pubis and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then gently bend her backward little by little, and let her be held from behind. Then let the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball in her vulva.
Then the woman is shaken and her loins are raised little by little; then that cotton comes out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the fracture of the bone returns. Then a compress is placed on her back. When she wants to urinate, the cotton is removed gently so that she can urinate.
And it is returned in the manner in which it was first inserted, then she returns to her first compress. She does this for seven days or so, then it heals. And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube to its mouth, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Then blow strongly into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva; then the fracture returns. Then pack it with cotton and leave it as we described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this is used in its treatment.
And its setting is as we described for the hip bone. The correct treatment of these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone who has some experience and understands this book well, is not hidden from you, for the fracture itself will guide you in most cases.
Understand the correct way to treat and bind it. As for the penis, if it is fractured, take a goose's windpipe and insert the penis into it; then a bandage of cloth is placed on it, and it is bound and left for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the treatment of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Whoever suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or humerus or similar, should immediately be bled at the time if the conditions for bleeding are present, as we have previously explained.
If the wound bleeds, you should immediately stop it by applying powdered vitriol if nothing else is available. Then, set the fracture on that same day and do not delay.
If no hot inflammation occurs, then if hot inflammation does occur, delay setting it until the ninth day until the hot inflammation subsides, and do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for it exposes it to bad symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin and exposed, you should gently try to reduce and align it with your hands with a slight pull. If you cannot reduce and align it with your hands, reduce it with this instrument; it is an instrument made of iron, its length being about seven or eight fingers. And its width is according to the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of them, according to what he needs in the treatment of each type of fracture.  Let them be round, with a little thickness, so that they do not bend when pressed during use.
And let the ends be sharp, with a curve at its end. Let the top be thicker and from its middle to the bottom much thinner.  This is its image:
It is called in Greek *pyrmos*, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, curved end should be placed on the end of the protruding bone, and it should be pushed gently until the bone returns and is somewhat aligned, so that you align the ends of the fracture with one another.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then the end of that bone should be cut until the instrument can grasp it. If you are not able to reset the bone as we have described at all, then cut it with a similar cut to those we have mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, however you can. Then remove any roughness and thin scales remaining on the bone. If, after resetting it, the patient feels severe, bothersome pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, then do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. When you have completed the setting of the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not apply any ointment or anything containing fat to the wound.
Lest putrefaction and corruption occur in it. Then, when you have finished setting the bone, use splints and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, the size of the wound.
And beware, with all caution, of tightening the bandage around a fracture, for many ignorant physicians have done this, causing either death, gangrene, or tetanus in their patients. Let your binding be gentle, loose, and unlike the binding of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels disturbing pain in the place, then you should not apply splints, but make bandages from strong cloths in the place of the splints, and bind it with them.
If after a day or two you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth that you placed on it with the drink, then use lint and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the four-ingredient ointment and the like, and you should loosen the bandage.
And examine the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals.  It is necessary to position the limb so that the pus flows downwards easily. If many days pass and the wound does not heal and the pus does not cease, then know that there are small fragments of bone.
Then you should probe the wound; whatever of those fragments is loose, remove and extract it; and whatever is not loose, and is causing pain and injuring the limb, then work at cutting and extracting it in every way you can.
If the wound shows signs of gangrene, or ulceration, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should counter each symptom with a similar treatment to that which was previously described in its chapter.
And what you should pay attention to and keep in mind is that if a large bone is broken and protrudes from a limb, such as the femur or humerus and similar large limbs, do not attempt to pull it or extract it. For death often results from this; rather, leave it until it putrefies, for perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of complications which occur after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially those near the joints, making the limb unsightly and perhaps preventing its natural function.
Examine it; if the complication is fresh, use astringent medicines such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, gum tragacanth, acacia, and similar things. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent syrup, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the complication with a bandage and bind it tightly. Leave the bandage undisturbed for many days, then remove it and reapply another, until the complication disappears, God willing, or bind a tight lead plate to it.
For lead has the property of removing all that is superfluous in the limbs. If the complication has hardened and become severe, and removal is necessary, incise it from above and cut away the superfluous growth, or scrape it off with a scalpel until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the treatment of a fracture, if it has healed but the limb remains thin and not as it was originally.
If a bone fracture has healed but the limb remains thin and weak, this is due to many causes. One cause is excessive loosening and tightening of the bandages, or excessive tightening of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, or excessive and repeated bandaging, or excessive movement at the wrong time, or a deficiency of blood and weakness in the patient's body.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body so that his blood increases, and to use the bath, and to make him happy and cheerful, and so on. Then, apply pitch to the limb so that it draws much nourishment to it, or repeatedly bandage it with lukewarm water. until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-two.
In the treatment of fractured bones which have been set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or a projection of the fractured bone, or a complication appears, and the appearance of the limb is thereby disfigured. Unless the limb is prevented from its natural function, it is not proper to accept the opinion of one who claims to break the limb from the head, as many ignorant physicians and bone-setters in our country used to do.
And this action is utterly reprehensible, leading to great danger, the least of which is injury; but if the crookedness and complication are recent, it should be treated with water in which emollient herbs, such as mallow leaves and root, and vervain and the like, have been boiled.
And it should be bandaged with emollient bandages, such as well-made diachylon, or the sap of mallow root should be taken and beaten with chicken fat and cerate, and bandaged with it, or fat figs should be pounded with pigeon droppings and the like, among those medicaments called anti-adhesive.
And sometimes the complication will be resolved by constant gentle rubbing with the hands, and the movement of the limb in every direction at all times should be employed; but if the crookedness is old and severe and hardened, and treatment with iron is necessary.
Then it should be incised above, and the connection of the bone released, and whatever remains of the complication or bone should be cut with fine cuts, and gentleness should be employed therein with effort and care, then the wound should be treated as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
Dislocation of the jaw is the displacement of a joint from its place, hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing the patient severe pain and suffering.  Therefore, if anyone suffers a dislocation of the jaw, he should immediately proceed to its reduction.
He should not delay at all, for if he delays, the area will swell and become inflamed, making reduction of the jaw difficult. Therefore, he should not delay, nor move, nor stretch it while it is swollen, because this often causes the patient cramping and harmful pain.
But if this occurs, he should immediately bleed the patient, then leave him until the swelling subsides somewhat. Then he should bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reduce it, and treat each limb as described in its place.
The chapters on the jaw have also been arranged, as with fractures, from the top of the body to the bottom.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
Rarely do both jaws become dislocated; their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced, becoming somewhat relaxed, or they are completely dislocated, becoming relaxed. towards the chest, so that the saliva of the patient flows and he cannot hold it back, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stutters when he speaks. But if the dislocation is slight, in most cases it will return of its own accord very easily.
But if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to hasten its reduction quickly and not delay it at all.  This is done by having an attendant hold the patient's head, while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
or he inserts both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands from the outside, with which he adjusts it, and he instructs the patient to relax his jaw and release it to go to every direction, and the physician adjusts the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, then apply warm water and oil compresses until their reduction is facilitated, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we said.  When they have returned and become straight, and the patient's mouth is closed and they are not relaxed, then apply to them a bandage of rags with a poultice made from wax, oil and rosewater.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and let the patient sleep on his back with his head elevated between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left, and he should not strain to chew anything, but his food should be soft gruel.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is set, then let him eat whatever he wishes, and let him use it gently and not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, and yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult, if they become dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then fevers and persistent headaches often result from this, and the patient's abdomen may become distended, and he may vomit pure bile. If you see this, then know that it has become corrupted.
And many die from this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of the clavicle and the point of the shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it does not become dislocated from the inner side because of its connection to the chest; it may become dislocated to the outside, and this is apparent to the touch.  Its reduction is that the patient should lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then press the place with your hand strongly, and it will return. Then apply a bandage and supports and bind it tightly. As for its end which is near the shoulder and connected to it, it is rarely dislocated; but if it is dislocated, it should be reduced and set as we have mentioned and as seems best to you.
Then apply a bandage and supports and bind it tightly, and instruct the patient to remain quiet and still until it heals. With this same treatment, the point of the shoulder is also reduced if it has also shifted from its place.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder is dislocated in three ways: one is that it is dislocated towards the armpit downwards; the second is that it is dislocated towards the chest; and it may be dislocated above the shoulder, but this is rare.
It does not dislocate to the rear because of the shoulder blade, nor does it dislocate to the front because of the nerve.  Most often, it dislocates and moves downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, because it quickly comes out and quickly goes in.
But as for those who have much flesh, it is otherwise, that is to say, it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty.  And it may happen to some people that because of a blow or a fall, the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, and they think that it has dislocated; it is necessary to examine this until you ascertain its truth.
Then you proceed to its treatment.  The dislocation is recognized if it is downwards towards the armpit: if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the sound shoulder, you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the humerus twisted; and under the armpit, on palpation, the head of the humerus is like an egg.
And the patient cannot raise his hand to his ear, nor move it in all movements.  Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find this apparent to the touch, not hidden.
And this dislocation is easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  Its reduction is that a servant raises his hand upwards, then you place the thumbs of your hands under his armpit and raise the joint forcefully upwards to its place, while the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then he lowers it downwards, and it returns quickly. If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been for many days, then the patient should bathe in hot water and use things which relax and soften, such as cooking the root of mallow, fenugreek and rosemary in water and using it.
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool which is moderate between softness and firmness. Then the physician places his heel on the ball and holds the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, and it returns to its place. And if you wish to reduce it in this way, you should bring a taller man than the patient and have him stand at the side, and insert his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raise his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards his stomach. If the patient is light, it is necessary to hang something else on him to weigh him down, for then the jaw returns immediately. And it may also be reduced in another way.
And that is to fix in the ground a long piece of wood, the head of which is round in shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither thick nor thin, then it is placed under the patient's armpit after placing a soft cloth on the head of the wood, and the patient stands on the length of the wood.
Then you extend his hand downwards from the other side, and he also extends his body from the other side forcefully, then the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to reduce it by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is about four fingers, and its thickness is about two fingers, and it has a round head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit in this manner:
Then a soft cloth is tied to the round head so that the wood does not hurt the patient, then it is placed under the armpit, and the whole hand and arm are extended on the wood downwards, and the wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a horizontal beam. Let it be horizontal, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side; then the joint enters immediately. If it enters in any way possible, then a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the whole shoulder as it rotates from above. Then the ball is firmly tied under the armpit, and the bandage is wound from above, and his hand is hung from his neck.
And he is left without moving his hand for seven days, and the patient's food should be little until the limb is strengthened, for this is faster for its healing. Then it is untied after seven or five days, and it is exercised with movement; if it is firm and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to moisture or another cause, then cauterization with three cautery irons should be used as previously described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days and the joint is not stable,
the bandage and its tightening are repeated many times, and it is not stable, and it falls and relaxes, and she cannot raise it upwards, then know that the nerve in the head of the shoulder is severed, or stretched, or relaxed. Then know that the joint will never be stable in its place.
As for the dislocation which is towards the chest and breast and towards the back, its reduction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns, and all the tightening and treatment is used until it heals. If, after healing, numbness appears in the limb and it is slow in movement,
let the patient use the bath repeatedly until that numbness softens and returns to its original nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
In the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty also. It is dislocated in all directions, especially forwards or backwards, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is under sight and touch, to whichever direction it is dislocated.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one, that will be clearly apparent to you by the depression of the joint, and he cannot bend the arm nor touch his shoulder with it. And you should hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot inflammation occurs to it.
For if a hot inflammation occurs to it, its reduction is difficult and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backwards, for that is the worst of all types of dislocation and the most painful, and death often follows it.
And its reduction, if it is of a kind that can be reduced, is that a servant extends his hand with both his hands and arm extended, and the physician's hands are above and below the elbow, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of both his hands or with the base of his palms until it returns to its place.
And as for if the dislocation is forwards, it may be reduced by bending the hand forcibly until the base of its palm strikes the corresponding shoulder; and if the dislocation does not return, use very strong extension, which is that two servants extend the arm.
And two servants also hold the patient so that he does not move during the extension, then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide bandage around his hand. And when the physician touches the joint with his hands, he should lubricate them with oil so that it helps in easily slipping the joint.
Then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns; and after its return, a bandage containing astringents and desiccants, along with egg white, should be applied tightly, and the arm is suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is untied; and if the joint is stable in its place, untie the bandage and leave it. And if you see that the joint is not strengthened well, reapply the bandage and leave it for several days until it strengthens, then untie it.  And if a swelling occurs after the reduction and untying of the joint,
and difficulty in movement occurs, then use moistening in the bath and gentle massage and rubbing until it softens, or place a poultice of fat mutton on the joint, then bandage it and leave it on for a day and night, then remove it and take him to the bath; and when he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then reapply the poultice once, twice, and three times, along with going to the bath, until it softens. And if you wish to apply a moist, light poultice of cow dung with fat and bind it on, do that several times, for it softens and returns to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easy unlike other joints, except that it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time it dislocates, before the place swells or a hot swelling appears.
To reduce it, place the patient's wrist on a board, and let an attendant extend his hand; and let the physician place his hand on the prominence of the joint and push it until it returns.  However, it should be examined whether the dislocation has gone towards the inside of the hand.
Let the patient place the back of his hand on the board during extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is prominent towards the back of the hand, let the palm of his hand be placed on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the same prominence of the joint. If it returns immediately, well and good; otherwise, bind it with a bandage that alleviates the swelling.
And leave it; do not manipulate it again, for it will not tolerate [further manipulation], and you will not be able to reduce it after several days have passed, except that the joint remains crooked and does not harm the patient in any way except if the hand becomes weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then you know that the nerve is severed or bruised; there is no remedy for it except cauterization, which may or may not be helpful. When the reduction of the wrist is complete, apply the bandage we described, then bind it tightly and leave it for five days.
Then unbind it and exercise the hand. If its movement is difficult and there is any stiffness in it, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may be dislocated in any direction. If a finger is dislocated towards the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns to place. Then bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the direction in which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight on that day. If it is nighttime, bind it in the same manner; continue to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; bind it towards that same direction and do as you did before until it heals.  Do likewise if it is dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
If a vertebra of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death quickly overtakes the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's excrement passes involuntarily; he cannot retain it, and often some of his limbs relax, whether his legs, or arms, or one of them. But if only one vertebra is displaced, it often returns to its place.
And its displacement is in four directions; that which is displaced backward is called a hump. As for its treatment, you should observe: if the hump has occurred from childhood, there is no treatment for it, and no cure at all. But that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or the like...
The ancients mentioned it with various treatments in lengthy descriptions, most of which are of no benefit. I have shortened this, making the little that remains sufficient for the much that they produced, by my approximation to the meaning and explanation of it; and I have depicted the instrument differently from what they explained and described.
I say that a hump which occurs in the front of the chest has no remedy and no cure; and so also that which is to the sides.  Only that which occurs in the back is treated, in the way that I describe. This is to stretch the patient on his face.
on a level bench near a wall, and spread a wet mat beneath him so that his chest is not hurt. Then place an upright plank fixed in a hole in the ground at the head end of the bench, and another plank towards his feet at the other end of the bench.
And a servant holds the plank—let it not be firmly fixed in the hole—and another servant holds the other in that manner. Then wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage, and extend the end of the bandage to the plank at his head and tie it there.
Then tighten with another bandage above his hips, above his knees, and at his heels. Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other plank at his feet. Then each servant pulls on his plank with the bandages, and the two planks do not move from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not firmly fixed, as we said.  The physician places his hands forcefully on the hump until it returns, or he places a board on it, then leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board about three cubits long.
and make a hole in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, into which the end of the board is inserted. Then place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls strongly so that he presses down on the hump.
and it returns to its place. And if you wish to make it with a hand-twisted screw, then you plant two pieces of wood, a cubit long, in the ground at the head of the patient at the end of the shop, and at his feet at the end of the shop also two pieces of wood.
Let the distance between each piece of wood be a span.  And a hole is made in each piece of wood through which the screw passes.  And all the wood is firmly secured in the ground so that it does not move at all.  And insert a round rod, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end is a hole in which a rod a span long is firmly fixed with what is twisted. And in the other two pieces of wood similarly. Then tighten the bandage which you tightened on the chest of the patient in the screw which is at his head, and the bandages which you tightened on his legs in the screw which is at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each screw, twisting his hand with the instrument with which he twists the screw, and the physician straightens the hump as we have previously explained. And this is an image of the screw, the shop, and the patient:
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place is straightened, it is necessary to apply a drying compress with egg white, then lint, then place on top of the compress a splint of wood, its width three fingers or so, and its length as much as takes the place of the hump.
And over some sound beads, then it is bound with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers. If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of healing, then it is necessary to use softening and relaxing medicines, along with the use of the splint which we described, for a long time.
A lead plate may be used for this.  A protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it may be thought to be a dislocation, but it is an extra bone that has protruded. Do not treat this with this treatment, for death may result.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that dislocation occurs only in the hip joint and the shoulder joint, and not in other joints, which suffer slight displacement and distortion. The hip joint is dislocated in four ways.
That is to say, it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards. Most often it is dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards. The sign of its inward dislocation is that if you compare the sound leg of the patient with the affected leg, the sound leg will be longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the sound one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin. The area near the groin will be noticeably swollen because the head of the femur has moved there.
The signs of outward dislocation are the opposite of these.  The sign of forward dislocation is that he extends his leg completely, but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he attempts to walk, he cannot do so except forwards.
He retains his urine, his groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel. The sign of backward dislocation is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin, and his leg will also be shorter than the other.
The groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly in the position of the loin. As for the reduction of these dislocations, you should observe: if the dislocation is old, has persisted for a long time with the patient, and no attempt at reduction has been made and it remains in its state, then there is absolutely no treatment.
It should not be treated. As for one whose dislocation is recent, whatever type of dislocation it is among the four types, quickly twist the joint and stretch it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, perhaps...
it will return and will not need other treatment. If it does not return like this, then you should prepare a strong, capable assistant who will stretch his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another assistant who will stretch him from above.
so that he inserts his hands under his armpits, then tightens a soft bandage around the root of the thigh, and another third assistant holds the end of the bandage, and the stretching will be either from the front, from the groin towards the clavicle, or from behind towards the back.
And all of them should stretch at the same time until the patient is raised from the ground and remains suspended. This type of stretching is common to the four types. If the dislocation returns as we said, otherwise, each type needs the specific treatment that I will mention.
As for its specific reduction, if the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then a bandage should be applied to the root of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the area under the groin.
Then the bandage is stretched upwards from the groin to the upper body towards the clavicle, then another strong, capable assistant takes it with his arms and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and stretches it outwards with a strong pull, then it will return to its place.
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this member is reduced. If it is difficult for you and it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then you should tie the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and knees.
And the distance between each one and its partner should be four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended two fingers more than the other. Then the patient is suspended by the head from a wooden beam in the house, and his distance from the ground should be two cubits.
Then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the thigh, and another boy hangs onto the patient, and the other boy embracing the thigh pushes strongly, then the joint returns to its place quickly. As for its specific reduction if the dislocation is outward.
Then the patient should lie on the bench as we described for the hunchback, and the bandage should be tightened on his affected leg in particular and on his chest. Then two wooden beams are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head, then an additional wooden beam is placed in the middle of the bench, very firmly secured.
Wet rags have been wrapped around it so that the patient is not harmed. The beam should be between his thighs so that he does not be pulled downwards when extended. Then each servant pulls to his side and the physician sets the hip with his hands; if it responds to reduction.
Otherwise, place the board on him and press it down as we mentioned for the hunchback, except that the patient should lie on his sound side. And if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be extended at once while he is in this same position on the bench.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with the other hand; meanwhile, he extends the pressure downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backward, then the patient should not be extended downwards.
And it is raised above the ground, but it should be placed on something firm, just as it should also be, if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we mentioned about his lying on the bench on his face with the bandages tightened.
As we said before, and the pressing with the board should also be used on the place to which the joint has gone. When the hip joint has been completely reduced as it should be—and the sign of its reduction will not be hidden from you—extend the patient's legs.
Then if you see them even, and the patient bends and straightens his leg without difficulty, know that the member has been reduced as it should be. Then bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and bind it with a turban tightly so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days. Then untie the bandage and compare the leg with the other. If you see them equal in size, know that the reduction has held firm, and allow the patient to walk.  If you see some laxness in it,
then re-bandage it and tighten it as you did at first, and leave it for three days also. Then untie it, and let him walk slowly on it for some days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the treatment of the reduction of the knee.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards, that is to say backwards; it does not dislocate forwards at all. The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg to his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. The treatment of all types of its dislocation is that you seat the patient sitting with his legs extended, if he is able to do so, and a servant sits behind him to hold his waist and bend him slightly backwards; then you sit on his thighs.
And you place your back against his face and place his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your hands, interlacing your fingers on his knee, then you press the sides of his knee strongly with your hands, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh softly and without constraint. Then bandage it and bind the leg to the thigh, then bind them both together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. And let him only walk a little for a few days until it strengthens.
If it is impossible for you to return it by what we have described, then use strong traction with the bandages which I previously described in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may be dislocated slightly, or it may be completely dislocated.  Its dislocation is either inwards or outwards, and the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and prominent towards the side to which it has been dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight dislocation, it is easy to return it; this is done by gently stretching it with the hands and straightening it until it returns. As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you seat the patient and a strong servant holds him from behind his back at his waist.
Then you grasp his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below the foot at the place of the heel. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with the left twice, then straighten it with the left and push the front of the foot with the right towards the leg without violence.
Do this twice as we have described, then push the front of the foot towards the leg on the third occasion while you pull at the heel. If it returns in one or two attempts in this manner and you see the foot straight, then [well and good]; otherwise repeat the procedure on it, for it will return.
If it refuses to return by what we have described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and plant a strong, firmly fixed stake in the ground so that it lies between his thighs, having wrapped a cloth around it so that it does not hurt the patient, then a servant should hold his thigh.
Then another servant should stretch the leg, either with his hands or with a bandage which he ties around the neck of the leg. Then each servant should pull in the opposite direction to his companion, while the stake remains fixed between the patient’s thighs to hold him so that his body is not pulled downwards during the stretching; then the physician should set the dislocation with his hands.
And another servant should hold the healthy leg downwards, for the dislocation will return quickly. When the dislocation has returned and you see that it is correctly returned, then apply the dressing and the splint and tie it with firm bandages, and bind the foot with a bandage to the lower part. You should avoid the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
lest the bandage be tight upon it and hurt him. Then leave it for two or three days; if the bandage loosens, tighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day. And the patient should abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not recur and be spoiled, and will not then accept treatment. If a hot swelling appears, then you should use for its calming what we have previously described in another place concerning treatment and poultices, until it disappears.
Chapter thirty-four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes of the foot.
You should set what is dislocated with a gentle pull without force; this is not difficult, but easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the instep, then the patient should place his foot on a level surface of the ground.
Or on a board while he is standing like one walking, then you should place your foot on what is prominent from those joints, then press it down with your foot forcefully until it returns and you see that it is straight and no prominence appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes the whole foot and has two ends, then bind it tightly and firmly for three days, then unbind it and keep him from walking for many days until it is strengthened and you are safe from recurrence, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation which occurs with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both together.
When something like that happens and you attempt its treatment and setting, it often results in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except someone who is skillful in the art, long experienced, gentle, compassionate, careful, not reckless or rash, and that he should use in the beginning only medicines which calm hot swellings and leave the patient alone.
For it is only by God's power that I hope for safety from harm with mildness of the illness and some hope appears to you in it, then return it from its place at the first, before the hot swelling occurs.
If the member returns to what you intended, then use the treatment that calms hot swellings and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments; if the dislocation is with a fracture and there are detached fragments in the bone, then remove them. And follow in that what we mentioned in the simple illnesses which preceded in their places.
And strive with your utmost effort and refrain from entering the path of uncertainty, as I previously advised you, for that is more lasting for your reputation and safer for your honor, God willing.
