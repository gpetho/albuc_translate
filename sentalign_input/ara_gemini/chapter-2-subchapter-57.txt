Chapter fifty-seven on purifying/circumcising boys and treating what befalls them of errors/mistakes/accidents.
Circumcision is nothing but the severing of a connection, like other surgical procedures. However, since it is an act we perform by our will, and its use is particularly for boys, we must describe the best practice and the easiest way leading to safety. So I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is what we acquired through experience. This is because I found most surgeons and cuppers using cleansing with a knife and scissors, using a probe, tying with thread, and cutting with a fingernail. I have tried all of these methods, and I did not find anything better than cleansing with scissors and tying with thread. Cleansing with a knife frequently causes the skin to cling to it, because the skin of the foreskin is two layers. Sometimes the upper skin is cut and the lower layer remains, so another cut and renewed pain are necessary. Cleansing with a probe carries the risk of cutting the tip of the urethra because it might enter its opening. As for cleansing with a fingernail, the skin might slip and your work might be ruined, or the boy's skin might be naturally short – they are often born like this, not needing cleansing, and I have seen that. As for cleansing with scissors and tying with thread, experience has revealed its advantage to me. The scissors are suited to cutting because the blade on top is like the blade below, so when you press your hand, corresponding to the two blades, it cuts according to one measure and at one time. Thus, the thread becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra on all sides, no error occurring at all. The method is, first, to trick the boy, especially if he is one of those who understands a little, that you are only tying the thread on his urethra and leaving it until another day. Then, make him happy and cheer him up in every way you can and that his mind accepts. Then have him stand between your hands, upright, not sitting, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so the boy’s eye does not fall on them at all, or on any of the instruments. Then, insert your hand into his urethra and inflate the skin and pull it upwards until the head of the urethra comes out. Then clean it of any dirt collected in it. Then tie the indicated place with a doubled thread. Then tie a second knot a little below it. Then firmly grasp the place of the lower knot with your thumb and index finger. Cut between the two knots. Then quickly pull the skin upward and bring out the head of the urethra. Then let the blood flow for a bit, as this is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth. Then sprinkle on it some ash of dried, burnt gourd, as it is the best I have tried, or fine barley flour, which is also excellent. Then place on the wound, on top, in a cloth, a slice of an egg cooked in rose water and mixed with good, fresh rose oil. Leave it on him until the next day. Then treat him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed. This is a picture of the scissors that are suitable for cleansing:
It should be a sharp, straight scalpel, with a smooth nail.
And the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the two handles.
As for the error that occurs during circumcision, sometimes the inner skin is completely or partially inverted during the cutting.
Therefore, you should immediately stretch it with your fingernail before the area swells and cut it evenly.
If you are unable to grasp it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it.
If three days have passed and what is under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the hot swelling subsides, then gently peel it off and cut it as you see fit.
Be careful of the head of the urethra, for if something is cut from the head of the urethra, it will not harm it.
Treat it with what heals the wound from the peaks that we described in the article on peaks.
And if some of the skin is cut beyond the required amount and it retracts upwards, that also does not cause much harm.
So treat it with what we have mentioned until it heals.
