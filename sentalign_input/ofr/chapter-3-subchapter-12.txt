Of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "foscile," one of which is small, and is the one that follows the thumb; and the other is large, and is the one that is below, towards the little finger; sometimes the large foscile breaks alone, or the small one, and sometimes both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration and healing are easy; and when the large one is broken, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when they are both broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken alone, then it should be extended slightly and set evenly.
And if it is the large foscile, it must be tightened more firmly; and extend it on a cushion, and hold the thumb of the hand higher than the others, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient be crossed over himself, with a cushion in front of him higher up, so that the patient does not suffer any strain; then let the attendant extend his arm below the hand, or with a bandage, and another attendant above.
And then the physician sets it evenly, according to its best form.
And if there are pieces in the break, put each one in its place, and if there is any separated piece that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut open and remove it, as we have said before.
And if there is a wound with the break, I have spoken of it in the specific chapter; so take care of it.
And if at the beginning of the restoration hot abscesses arise, then glue on a cloth of cerate made of rose oil and white wax, that is neither too hard nor too soft; and tie a thin cloth over it, until the hot abscess is calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and apply a poultice of mill dust with plenty of egg, then place the splints, and the splint on the break should always be stronger, and a bit wider than the others; and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several arrangements: whether the break is in one of the bones, or in two; and tighten more over the break than elsewhere, and always less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and the cloths that are on the break should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and the thread with which it is tied should be linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said. 
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days.
And if some bad condition comes to the limb, such as itching, then you should wash the limb with warm water, until the itching is soothed; and let the limb rest, not tightly bound.
And then begin the binding again, and if the bandage is loose and the bones separated, or something similar, then adjust it.
And pay attention if nourishment cannot reach the limb, because it is too tight, then you should loosen it a bit, and leave it thus for a few days, until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have mentioned happens to the patient, then do not unbind it until twenty days.
or thereabouts, then he hangs his hands around his neck, and keeps his neck straight, and guards against movement and throwing, and sleeps on his back; and know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or in thirty-five, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of the humors.
