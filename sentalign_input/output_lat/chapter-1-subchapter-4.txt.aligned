On the cauterization of chronic migraine.	On the method of cauterizing for an old hemicrania.	0.6229958
When you have treated a migraine in the way we have described and with what we have mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you perceive that the malady is such that the cauterization we have mentioned before does not suffice for it, either with caustic or with the actual cautery, you should heat an edged cautery to white heat after you have marked the place with a line half a finger's breadth long or thereabouts; and impress your hand once and maintain the pressure till you cut down upon the artery and reach the bone.	When you treat hemicrania using the preceding treatment we mentioned and what we described in the divisions of ailments, and the treatment is ineffective, and you see from the illness that what we said about the initial cautery with medicine or with fire is not enough, then you should heat the knife-shaped cautery until it turns white, after marking the area of pain with a line about half a finger’s length or close to that; place your hand down once, and press it until you cut into the artery and reach the bone.	0.89067054
You must be careful of the mandibular joint which moves in chewing, that you do not cut the muscle or tendon that moves it, causing spasm.	However, it is necessary for you to avoid the area of the jaw joint, which moves during chewing, to avoid burning the side or the nerve that controls it, lest spasm result.	0.7604175
Have the utmost care of haemorrhage from the artery you have cut, for the occurrence of that is dangerous, specially with one who does not know what to do, having no experience or practice; it is better to refrain from operating.	And be cautious and careful regarding the blood flow from the artery that is severed. For there is danger in its cutting, especially for one who does not know what he is doing and is neither diligent nor experienced, and abandons the procedure at the first difficulty.	0.7745934
We shall later on mention a treatment for accidental haemorrhage of the artery, in due detail, in its proper place in this book.	And I will address the regulation of blood flow that may occur from the artery in its own proper method and place in this book.	0.65434164
But if you see that this cautery is not enough for this disorder and you see that the patient is of bodily fitness for it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound till healed.	But if you see from the illness that this cautery is insufficient for him, and you see that the patient’s body can tolerate the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, treat the wound until it heals.	0.90864503
If you prefer, employ that cauterization which we have described in the chapter on the extraction of an artery, with the cautery of two blades; for that is a cauterization better and more effective than this.	And if you wish, apply the cautery we described in the chapter on artery extraction, using a cautery with two blades. For this cauterization is better than this one and more effective.	0.9108169
