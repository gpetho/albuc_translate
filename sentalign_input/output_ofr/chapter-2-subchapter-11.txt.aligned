of the hairs of the eyelids When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural ones, and they become irritating, they harm the eyes, and cause various ailments such as habitual tears and softening of the eyelids and albugo, so much so that it causes the destruction of the eyes; and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is described above in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and stitching or by small tubes, as I will explain.	When superfluous lashes grow on the eyelid outside their natural place, below the natural lashes, and continue, they injure the eye and give rise to many kinds of disease, such as chronic lachrymation, dropping of the eyelids (ptosis), and whiteness and opacity, eventually resulting in the destruction of the eye. The plastic operation on the eye is carried out in four ways: by the actual cautery; by caustic in the way mentioned above in the book on cauterization; by incision and suture; or with canes, as I shall describe.	0.81957895
then cut what is left over with small, even strokes, according to the form which is here:	Then cut away the superfluous lid with a small pair of scissors with an even incision. The scissors are of this pattern.	0.61486167
The treatment of the sloughs is as follows: you must turn the eyelid and cut it inside as I have said, and then make two sloughs artificially, and two thin ligatures as long as the eyelid and the width of the spatumile (spatula/scalpel); and cut at the two ends on the two sides where you hold the threads; then join one and the other subtly over what remains of the eyelid, and tighten the two sloughs on both sides firmly; and leave it like that for a few days, and the skin that was tightened will die and blacken and rot, until it falls off by itself.	Trimming the lid by means of canes is done as follows: you invert the eyelid and cut the inner slit as I have described; then you prepare two slender canes or rods of a length equal to that of the eyelid and a breadth less than that of a scalpel; and at either end of each you make a notch to hold the threads. Then gently put them together over the superfluous part of the eyelid and tie them firmly together at both ends and leave for a few days; for the ligated flesh will necrose and turn black and putrefy and eventually fall away spontaneously.	0.8920831
If it is slow, cut it with forceps, then treat it until it is healed; and when the wound is healed, the eyelid will be raised, and the hairs will no longer prick; and this is the form of the two sloughs that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:	But if it is slow in sloughing, cut off with shears; then dress till healed. And when it is healed the eyelid will be raised and the lashes will no longer irritate the eye. Now this is the figure of the canes; you should prepare them exactly in this shape and of this length and breadth.	0.80379826
