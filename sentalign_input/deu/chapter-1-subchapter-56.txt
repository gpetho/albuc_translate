Chapter Fifty-Six:
On the cauterization for arterial bleeding caused by an incision.
Often, arterial bleeding occurs due to an incision from an external wound, from the incision of abscesses, or from cautery of a limb, and such cases are difficult to manage.
When this happens, quickly apply your hand to the artery's opening, pressing your index finger firmly over it until the blood flow stops.
Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire, blowing on them until they are very hot.
Take a small or large cautery, depending on the location and wound size, and quickly apply it to the artery as you remove your finger, keeping it in place until the blood flow is cut off and stopped.
If blood is expelled from the artery's opening when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, quickly take another cautery prepared in the fire and continue this until the blood is restrained.
Be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, to avoid causing further harm to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding, especially if the artery is large, except by one of four methods: either with a cautery as we have mentioned, or by extraction when it is not drawn out, for when it is drawn out, the ends are better burned and the bleeding is stopped, or it is tied with a thread or by strong binding, or medicines with the property of stopping bleeding are applied to it; and they are pressed with an appropriate compress.
But one who administers proper restriction by binding and compressing with cloths or by applying burning substances and similar methods, will not succeed except late.
But if this happens to someone and neither the doctor nor medicine is present, then act by calmly placing the index finger over the opening of that vein as we have said, and apply strong pressure until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and the finger is not removed from the artery; and the artery is sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is coagulated and thickened; and then consider whether it needs cautery or medicine.
