Restoration of fractures of the arm.	On setting a fracture of the forearm.	0.5784143
The arm consists of two bones called the forearm bones; one is small, located near the thumb, and the other is larger, located near the little finger, on the lower side.	The forearm consists of two bones and is sometimes called 'the two firesticks'. One of these bones is small and is in line with the thumb, the other is large; this is the one placed lower, under the smaller one.	0.84941053
The larger bone often breaks alone or with the smaller bone.	The larger alone may be broken, or the smaller alone, or both broken together.	0.7094945
When the small upper bone breaks, the restoration and healing are easier.	When the small upper bone (radius) is broken it is easy to set and its mending is rapid.	0.7622112
When the lower bone breaks, the fracture and healing are more difficult.	When the lower bone (ulna) breaks it is bad and its mending is difficult.	0.783643
The worst case is when both bones break together.	Worst of all is when both bones break together.	0.9646194
If the small upper bone breaks, it is advisable for the doctor to apply gentle extension until it is aligned.	If the broken bone is the radius, the doctor when setting it must use light traction, gently, until he has it straight.	0.66733027
If the larger bone breaks, a stronger extension is needed.	If it is the ulna that breaks, he must employ stronger traction on it.	0.68418145
If both bones break together, apply a much stronger extension.	If both bones break he must employ very strong traction.	0.8020798
The hand should be positioned with the thumb higher than the other fingers, resting on a cushion, and the patient sitting on a square seat.	During setting and extension the hand must be disposed on a cushion, spread out with the thumb uppermost, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger downmost, while the patient sits cross-legged upon the floor.	0.6924628
Place a cushion in front at the appropriate height to avoid discomfort.	The cushion should be on a level with him so that he does not suffer discomfort.	0.6070604
One assistant extends the lower part of the arm with their hand or a bandage, while another does the same for the upper part.	Then let an attendant extend the arm from below, either by hand or by means of a band, while another attendant extends it from above similarly.	0.7243824
The doctor aligns the bone to restore it to the best possible position.	Then the doctor may straighten the bone so as to restore it to the best possible shape.	0.81493926
If there are bone fragments, you must place each piece in its proper location with your skill.	If there be any splinters in the fracture he must do his utmost to restore each splinter to its place.	0.65744436
If a fragment appears separated and pierces the skin without hope of restoration, treat it as previously described.	If a detached splinter appears there and is piercing the skin and you have no hope of restoring it, cut down upon it and remove it in the manner we have mentioned earlier.	0.81581616
If the fracture involves a wound, refer to the specific chapter on this and follow its treatment.	If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, we have devoted a separate section to this, so take the treatment of it from there.	0.76609784
If an abscess occurs at the beginning of the restoration, apply a cloth with cerate made of rose oil and white wax, moderately thick, and tighten it gently until the abscess subsides; then remove the cerate, apply a plaster made of powdered herbs and egg white, and use the widest and strongest splint over the fracture.	If, when you begin to set the bone, an effusion occurs, smear a cloth with the wax made from oil of roses and white wax, of medium thickness, and bind the dressing on gently. When the effusion subsides, remove the wax and apply the plaster prepared from mill-dust and egg-white, then apply splints; the splint that goes on the actual fracture should be a little wider and stronger than the rest.	0.8745091
Know that the number of splints for the arm is six in major cases, whether one or both bones are fractured.	You should know that the number of splints for an arm is, as a rule, six, whether the fracture be of one bone or of both together.	0.8618666
Then apply the bandage most tightly over the fracture, loosening it slightly above and below as mentioned earlier.	Then bandage more tightly and strongly over the site of the fracture, and, as you wrap the bandage above and below the fracture, bind little by little more loosely according to the instruction given at the beginning of the book.	0.7414581
The cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not hard or rough, and the string used for tightening should be moderately thick, as described.	The dressings wound round the fracture should be gentle and soft, not very hard, while the cord for binding is best made of linen of medium thickness as we have prescribed.	0.8152523
Check the limb and bandage regularly for a few days. If an issue requiring correction arises, such as itching, soak the limb in warm water until it subsides.	Some days later, examine the limb and the bandaging and if anything has happened that should be put right, such as pruritus in the limb, the limb should be bathed in warm water until the pruritus has subsided.	0.8326684
Leave the limb untightened until it rests, then reapply the bandage.	Let the limb be unbandaged for one night so that he may rest, then put the bandage on again.	0.77370346
If the bandage has loosened and the bone is misaligned, correct it with your skill.	If the bandaging has become loose and the bone has shifted or anything of that sort, correct it all diligently.	0.6504613
Check if the tightness restricts nutrition to the limb; if so, loosen it slightly for a few days to allow nutrition flow, then retighten.	Look also to see if nourishment is being prevented from reaching the part on account of over-bandaging, in which case you will have to loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it; then bind it up.	0.7754742
If none of these issues occur, do not loosen the bandage for about twenty days.	But if none of those things that we have mentioned happens to the patient, it should not be loosened until after about twenty days.	0.70589435
Suspend the patient's hand to encourage movement and have them sleep on their back.	Then the patient's hand is to be suspended from his neck, the arm being level, and he should guard carefully against agitated movements, and should sleep on his back.	0.5741497
Know that this fracture heals in thirty to thirty-two days, or even twenty-eight days, depending on the individual's constitution and vitality.	You should know that this fracture of the arm mends in thirty or thirty-two days, and sometimes in twenty-eight, depending on the individual's constitution and the condition of his strength.	0.87257576
