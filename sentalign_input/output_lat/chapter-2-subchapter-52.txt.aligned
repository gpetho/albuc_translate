On the treatment of umbilical protrusion.	On the treatment of protruding navel.	0.9149809
An umbilical protrusion can arise from various causes. It may be due to fissures in the abdominal membrane, allowing a part of the intestines or abdominal tissue to push out, as can occur in other types of hernias. Or it may result from blood flowing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned. Or it could be caused by trapped gas in that area.	The navel becomes prominent from many causes; either from a rupture of the peritoneum over the abdomen, so that omentum or intestine comes through it as in other ruptures; or from blood extravasation from an artery or vein, as we have mentioned; or else from wind trapped in it.	0.8617541
If it’s due to excess moisture, it is soft and does not recede or expand when pressed with your hand.	If it be due to fluid, it will be soft and will not disappear on manual pressure, nor will it grow larger or smaller.	0.7651061
If it’s due to blood, then the abscess appears with dark discoloration in addition to these signs.	If it be due to blood, then in addition to these signs the tumour will appear blackish.	0.90405667
If it’s caused by excess tissue growth, then the abscess is serious, thick, hard, and has a consistent size.	If it arise from a fleshy overgrowth, the tumour will be solid and hard, remaining always constant in bulk.	0.7406963
If it’s due to gas, it has a soft feel to the touch.	If it be due to wind, it will be soft to the touch.	0.7323339
The procedure requires assessing if the umbilical protrusion is due to an arterial or venous blood issue, or to trapped gas; in such cases, you should refrain from attempting treatment. In such cases, fear and danger are involved, as I explained in the chapter on abscesses related to arteries and veins.	The operation for these is to examine, and if the exomphalos be due to arterial or venous blood, or wind, you should withhold treatment since it is dangerous in these cases, with an uncertain outlook, as I taught you in the chapter on tumours arising from an artery or vein.	0.79352397
If the umbilical protrusion is due to the intestine or tissue, instruct the patient to hold their breath and stand up straight. Then mark around the entire umbilicus with ink. Next, instruct the patient to lie down on their back with you supporting them. Then use a broad spatula to press around the umbilicus in the area you marked with ink.	But if it be due to bowel or omentum, bid the patient hold his breath and stand stiffly upright; then make an ink mark all round the umbilicus; then tell him to lie on his back before you; then with a broad scalpel cut all round the umbilicus along the line marked out; then draw up the middle of the tumour with a large hook; then ligature the site of the incision with a strong thread or silk cord, tying it securely with a slip-knot.	0.8329693
Next, open the extended middle of the abscess above the tied area. If you find that it is caught by the ligature, remove the knot, insert your index finger, and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If tissue is present, grasp it with a hook and cut off any excess.	Then open the middle of the tied tumour above the ligature and insert your forefinger and search for the bowel; and if you find it caught in the ligature slacken the slip-knot and push the bowel back into the abdomen. But if you find omentum, stretch it with a hook and cut off what is superfluous.	0.86180365
If you encounter an artery or vein, work carefully around it. Then continue with your procedure. Take two needles threaded with strong thread, and insert them around the abscess in a cross pattern, making sure they penetrate.	And if you come across an artery or vein, tie it securely and go on with your work: take two needles and thread them with two strong threads and insert the two needles into the incision that you have made around the tumour, pushing them in so that they cross one another.	0.81102943
Then, tighten the abscess in four places over the needles. If you wish, remove the needles and leave it until the stretched tissue rots and falls off naturally, or cut it off once it becomes thin and decomposed.	Then ligature the tumour in four places over the needles. If you wish, you may remove the needles and let be until the ligatured tissue necroses and falls away of its own accord; or cut it away when it is thin and necrosing.	0.9119432
Then treat it with the necessary ointments until it heals.	Then dress with the needful ointments until healed.	0.91539586
If the umbilical protrusion is due to excess tissue or moisture, then hollow out the abscess as we have described. And remove any blood or moisture that you find inside.	But if the prominent navel be due to an overgrowth of flesh there or from humidity, you should slice the tumour as we have said and get out all the blood or humidity to be found there.	0.80355597
Then treat it with something that will harden and stabilize the area.	Then dress it with stimulating dressings.	0.4286609
