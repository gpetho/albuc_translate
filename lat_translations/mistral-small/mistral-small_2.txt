Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed this book for you, my Sons, which is the last in the science of medicine with its complement, and I have reached the end of it according to its exposition and declaration, it seemed to me that I should complete it with this Tractate, which is a part of the operation, namely surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Because the operation by hand has fallen into disuse in our region and time, so that perhaps its knowledge has perished and its trace has been cut off; and nothing of it remains except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have changed, and error and hesitation have befallen them until their intentions were closed and their power was distant. It seemed to me that I should revive this science with the arrangement of this Tractate in it according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I come with the forms of the tools of cautery and the other instruments of work: as is done by the addition of declarations and their hastening.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a good artisan of it is not found with his hand in this our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen has narrated, until he knows the supports of the limbs and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and sinews, and their number, and their exit, and the pulsatile and quiet veins, and the places of their exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And because of that, Hippocrates said: "The name with the name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 But we have already spoken about this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 "For one who is not skilled in anatomy may fall into error, by which people are killed: as I have seen many of those who boast about this skill without knowledge or experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 "That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut out a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and he cut some of the arteries in the neck; therefore the blood flowed from the woman until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 "And I saw another physician who dared to remove a stone from a man who had grown old, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 "So he came to him and removed it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 "Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 "And indeed I had already been called to remove it; and seeing the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 "And I saw another physician who was receiving a fee from a certain Duke of our land for his medical skill; and it happened that the Duke's black eunuch had a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound up the fracture on the wound with bandages and tight cords, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 "Then he released him according to his wishes.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 "After a few days he dismissed him and instructed him not to loosen the bandage; and it remained so until his leg became swollen, as well as his foot, and it came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 "So I was called to him; and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and he was restored to peace, and escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 "However, the corruption had already set in the limb; and I could not prevent it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Thus, when the corruption ceased wandering through the limb, until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician, who punctured a cancerous abscess: and after some days it ulcerated, until its evil grew great with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 That is, because when it is a pure cancer of black bile, then one must not approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can endure it, so that the whole of it may be cut out.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And for this reason, O Sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation which is associated with health, and the operation with which there is danger in many cases.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already pointed out in every place of this book where the operation comes which has terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and abandon it, so that the foolish may not find a way to speak and dishonor it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Receive therefore the measure with diligence and care, and your weak ones with ease and strength, and use the better way leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy success: and put away terrible diseases that are difficult to cure: and lift up your spirits from that which makes you afraid, so that hesitation may not enter upon you in your faith and advantage. xspace
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it is more lasting to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 For Galen has already said this in some of his warnings.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat the disease badly, lest you be called bad physicians.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter One
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 Of the Cautery with fire, and of the Cautery with sharp medicine, arranged and ordered from the head to the feet, and with forms of instruments and tools of the Cautery: and everything necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 On incisions and punctures, bloodletting and cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and similar things; all arranged according to the shapes of the instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 On the restoration of dislocations and the treatment of twists, and similar things; arranged by parts from head to foot and according to the shapes of the instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be glory.

Pars I.	 Part I
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 On the benefit and harm of cautery; in which constitutions it is beneficial, and at what times; whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter One
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 But before remembering the use of cautery, it is necessary to say what its beneficial and harmful qualities are, and in which constitution it should be used.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I say therefore that the discourse on the quality of the benefit and harm of cautery is a lengthy, subtle, scientific, and hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Many wise men have spoken about it and differed on the subject, and for me a little of their speech is enough, fearing lengthiness. ︎
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I say therefore that cautery is beneficial to every constitution, whether material or immaterial, except for two constitutions: a hot constitution without matter and a dry constitution without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 But in a hot and dry constitution with matter they differed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 For some have said that cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others said the opposite, that is, that cautery is not suitable for an illness caused by heat and dryness; since the nature of fire is heat, and it is inappropriate to heal a hot and dry illness with what is hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And the one who speaks against that says: that by cautery there is a benefit in every hot and dry disease which occurs in human bodies; because when you compare the human body and its humors to the nature of fire, you find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I say through his statement: because experience has revealed this to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 However, it is not necessary that this be attempted except by one who has already been tested and practiced in the last exercise of cautery, and knows the diversity of human complexions, and the nature of diseases within them, and their causes, and their symptoms, and the duration of time for them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 From the other complexions there is no need to fear, especially in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For all doctors have agreed upon them; and they have not disagreed about the benefit of cautery in those cases.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, my sons, that the secret of treatment by cautery with fire and its goodness is superior to cautery with burning medicine, because fire is simple, whose action does not extend except to the member which is cauterized; and it does not harm another connected member, unless with slight harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of burning medicine extends to what is distant from the members; and perhaps it brings about disease in the member which is difficult to heal, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 Indeed, we have learned this through experience because of the length of our service and study with art, and our commitment to the truth of things; and for that reason I am excused from further discourse.  />  />
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would bring you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in expelling humors from the body, demonstrated with philosophical discourse which would be understood by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, my sons, that they disagree about the time when it is suitable to perform cautery, and they consider spring to be a better time.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that cautery is suitable at any time; for the harm caused by the time will be overwhelmed by the benefit derived from cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if cautery is necessary because of severe and persistent pains that do not tolerate delay; for fear that from them something worse may occur than the slight harm caused by the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And let it not enter your minds, my sons, that only the common and foolish physicians think so; namely, that the disease which is cured by cautery does not always return: and they put forward this consequence, but it is not as they think; because cautery is only in the place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the causes of pains.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 Nevertheless, cautery excels medicine in the swiftness of its effect, and the power of its action, and the strength of its dominion: and it is possible for the disease to return at some time according to the complexion of the patient, and the location of his disease, and its power; and what has been prepared in his body through the accumulation of superfluous humors in him; and what reaches him from his food and similar causes, unless the disease is one in which cautery is applied.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A slight disease of a member with few superfluous humors and moisture, such as tooth cautery for pain, and similar conditions, it is possible that this pain will not return.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But this happens rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 But the common saying that cautery is the last resort of medicine is true; not in the sense they intend by it; for they believe that there is no cure which is as effective as medicine or any other treatment after cautery has been applied. (){#}
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 "The truth of the matter is contrary to this, and the intent is that cautery is the last resort in medicine; it is not used unless when we apply methods of healing for some ailments, those remedies do not work. Then at the end, we apply cautery, and it helps. Therefore, it follows that cautery is the last resort in medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and most ignorant physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 "The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the nobility of its substance. They also said that the site of the cautery does not become inflamed.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 "In truth, this is not absolutely the case; for I have already tested it and found that, in some bodies, it does so without any other cause.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 "And cautery with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 "However, when you use a cautery made of gold in the fire, it does not indicate to you when it has reached the desired heat because of the redness of the gold; and if it cools down too quickly, and if you add more fire, it melts in the flame and turns into layers.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 "For this reason, the craftsman falls into difficulty with it; and for this reason, cautery made of iron is quicker and more convenient for us, being suitable for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 "And I have already arranged this chapter on the cautery according to chapters, and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that they may provide relief for those seeking something from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 "About the Method of Cauterizing the Head in the Coronal Suture.
Caput II.	 "Chapter Two
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 "This cauterization is beneficial for controlling moisture and coldness over the brain, which are two causes of headaches, excessive flow of humors to the eyes and ears, too much sleep, toothache, throat pain, and universally all ailments that occur from coldness, such as paralysis, headaches, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is as follows: first instruct the patient to evacuate with a cleansing purgative for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then have him sit facing you, with his hands placed on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with ink.  />  And do this three times in succession.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then prepare the cautery iron for the fire: its form is as follows.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it on the marked spot with ink, gradually tightening your hand as you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then quickly lift your hand and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that the bone has been exposed to the size of a lentil or a grain of barley, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, repeat with the same iron or another one if this one has cooled down: until you see the bones I mentioned to you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a cloth in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it there for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place a cloth soaked in butter over it, and leave it on the spot until the scar of the fire is destroyed.  />
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with four-ingredient ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 They say that the more open the wound remains, the more pus is released, which is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some say that the skin should be cauterized all the way to the bone, and that the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then it is scraped from the burned area of the bone, then it is cleaned.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 And others say that one should use the cautery until it reaches the end, so that it makes an impression on the bone in the shape of a circle: or they use a small instrument that women place into infusions of alphabet letters; and they believe that the vapors of the head are expelled from this location, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then it should be cleaned until it heals.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 But these two types of cautery seem to me not at all except in some people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And leaving it is better for me with his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 The head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have testified with other members; and especially when the head is naturally weak due to illness. The first type of cautery, however, is safer and better for me, and I use it. Therefore, operate with it in safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 About how to cauterize the head when the whole head hurts.
Caput III.	 Chapter 3
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When a chronic and persistent pain occurs in the whole head of the patient, and he makes use of hyeres (a type of poultice), coches (ointments or unguents), head purges, oils, and emplastrums (medicated plasters).
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if it has already been cauterized with the one-pronged cautery that we have described, and none of those things help him, then consider this.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 For if the patient's head is of a strong natural constitution and not weak, and he finds severe cold, then cauterize him with another cautery under that one, in a small amount.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize him over every horn of his head with the cautery, so that it does not penetrate through the skin, and expose a quantity from the bone as we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And burn it with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place called vas: and lift up your hand in this manner, and do not expose the mouth.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the patient will find on account of this a very severe pain, and different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I call this cautery the one for its place: and it should be a cautery that is finer than the one used to cauterize the horns of the head and its back.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 § On how to cauterize for migraine, both with a burning drug and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter Four
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain occurs on one side of the head or extends to the eye and is evacuated with purgative drugs, and the remaining treatment as I mentioned in the divisions of diseases is not effective, then cautery for this condition is according to two methods: either cautery with a burning, acute drug; or with iron. 》
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cautery with a burning, acute drug is as follows: take one tooth of garlic and peel it, and cut off the tips from both sides of it.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then split the painful place in time with a wide fleam until there is made under the skin a space in which to insert the tooth.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Insert it under the skin until it is hidden; then tie over it with a suitable bandage; and leave it for fifteen hours; then untie it, and extract the garlic, and let the wound be left open for two days, or three; then place on it cotton soaked in butter until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed. 》
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to do this with some burning drugs that I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 The cauterization of it with iron is done in this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 A cautery of fire, the form of which is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 And it is called a nail-shaped cautery because the form of its head is like that of a nail, in which there is something of curvature, and in the middle of it is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the spot and hold your hand steady; and you revolve the iron little by little with speed; and let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, as its half.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then soak a piece of cotton in salt water and place it on the spot and leave it for three days; then place the cotton with butter; afterwards treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this half of the skull with the tip of a small knife similar to the cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 And beware of cutting an artery in this half of the skull, not properly ancient.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 § On the manner of cauterizing in the old half of the skull.
Caput V.	 Chapter Five
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you treat the half of the skull with what we have said in the previous treatment and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not help; and you see from the disease that what we have said from the first cautery with medicine or with the cautery with fire is not enough for it, then you must heat a knife-shaped cautery until it turns white after you mark on the spot of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or almost like that; and lift your hand once, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jawbone that moves during chewing, lest the side or the nerve that moves it be burned and a spasm occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 "And let it be over a cover, as a precaution against bleeding from the cut artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 "For its incision is fearsome, especially for one who does not know what he is doing and is neither diligent nor experienced; and he abandons the operation first of all.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 "And I will discuss the regulation of bleeding from an artery according to its manner and in the appropriate place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 "But if you see from the illness that this cautery is not enough, and you see the patient's body enduring the cautery on the middle of the head, as we have described, take care of the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 "And if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on extracting an artery with a double-bladed cautery.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 "For cauterization is better and more beneficial this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 "On the method of cauterizing for ear pain.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 "When ear pain occurs from cold and is treated with dissolving remedies and the other treatments we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not go away, then apply fire cautery. And this is what is called a 'punch,' which has this shape.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 "Then apply the punch after its burning around the entire ear, as it is shown; or around both ears if the pain is simultaneous in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 "And keep the cautery away from the root of the ear for a short while after marking the spots with wax; and let the number of punctures be ten on each ear, as shown.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 "Then care for the spots until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 "On the method of cauterizing for toothache.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 "The toothache that is treated with cauterization is only from the types that occur from phlegm, as we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And avoid cauterization for conditions caused by dryness and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When you treat this type of pain with herbs, and head washes, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, a second a little lower than its tympanum, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your cautery on the opposite side from the afflicted area.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Because softening occurs only in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the method of cauterization is that you cauterize with a cautery directly on the upper edge of the ear, a little below the horn of the head; and another in the tympanum, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with the cautery until the thickness of half the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species made from a knife, whose form has been described; however, it is not somewhat thinner than that which you see, and it must be a knife with a little excess thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then treat the places with what has been mentioned until they heal.

When the stroke has become old, and you treat it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head as we have said, and a cautery in the back of the head, according to what has been described: and the method of cauterization is according to what has been described. 》
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 And also cauterize with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is the most important [cautery]. 》

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then shave the whole head of the patient and place upon his occiput a plaster made of mustard, as described in the treatise on plasters; and repeat this several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For this is the method of cautery, and perform it in the same way as I mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If therefore he is cured by this, that is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not, then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and place between each cautery a thickness like that of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then treat the cauteries with what preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 But if you wish to add to it and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle.

Therefore, you should first cleanse his brain with hyeros and with the other treatment that we have mentioned in the division, when the patient is large or is able to take medicines.

When the tears of the eyes are old and constant, and they are on the veins and arteries which are externally visible on the forehead, it is verified that this is from cold and phlegmatic excesses; then cauterize with the same cautery as I narrated in the beginning for descending water, one cautery in the middle of the forehead, and two cauteries above the temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the bones.

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The caustic in it is according to two methods: either the caustic with fire, or the caustic with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 But in the caustic with fire, first instruct the patient to let their hairs grow out, if they are among those who pluck them, until they lengthen and even out.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 But if they prick him at their growth, then bind his eyes with a ribbon so that they do not move until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 Therefore, when they are born and even out, then place the patient's head in your lap; then mark on his eyelids with encaustic, a mark like the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place a cotton soaked in egg white or in the mucilage of fleawort over the eye. ¶ Et sic cauterizabis eum, et sanabitur.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then the caustic with fire, whose shape is this:
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize over the shape that you have marked little by little in many times, until the skin surface, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, becomes completely evident.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the sign of health of your work is: if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and the hairs lifting from the pricking point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then lift your hand; and leave him for three days. ¶ Deinde adiungas ei, in uino cum zibado, puluerem aloes de quattuor partibus, et mellis de uno: et mitte illum per nares.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place a cotton with butter on it, until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointment, until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If any hair grows back after an hour and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 But if the hairs are on the lower (eyelid), then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place, and it is even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.

Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from known soap and from unmixed lime a weight of one ounce or about that amount from each; then grind them together well until they become like this quickly, so that it does not cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then spread the paste from this onto the linen cloth you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or two eyes. ︎
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And place under the eye a compress soaked in egg white, and let the patient's head rest on your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it briefly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you move it whenever the patient feels the burning of the medicine, for its burning is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While this persists, which the patient finds to be a burning sensation, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the burning sensation has subsided, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water. ︎ ︎
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 And then consider if you see the eyelid being raised, as it is raised by contracting with fire or with incision; that is good. And if not, then repeat the medicine on the same spot where the medicine does not imprint and does not darken, until your work becomes even and the eye contracts. ︎ ︎ ︎
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then place on it the kohl with butter until the skin of the burn is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with diaphoretic ointment or another until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And it is necessary for you during the treatment that you guard with the highest care lest anything from the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 And if the eyelid softens after some days and something from the hairs enters into the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which becomes softened from the eyelid as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore let your consideration be according to this, and the way of righteousness shall not be hidden from him who is dedicated to this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 ¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Tear Duct.

Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Let it be hollow like the form of a vulture feather from one end, with which is made the cautery; and if its strength is to penetrate to the other end, and if its strength is upward thus do you try.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this hollow (one) is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then express the fistula if it is open, and draw out its pus, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it, and draw out its pus. ➤

Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then put a compress with butter on it, and care for him with a drying ointment until he is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.

Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 But if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.

When toothache is caused by coldness, whether the cold is within the tooth itself or in a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help, then there are two ways to apply cautery to it: either cautery with butter or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The method of cautery with butter is as follows: take fresh cow's butter and boil it in an iron ladle or a bronze bowl.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take a piece of cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe. 》

When the head is dislocated because of humors and does not reset within an hour after its dislocation, until it becomes habitual for it to return, then it should be reduced from a slight movement that occurs as we have already testified about that; then you should reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the patient is turned onto their back, or onto their healthy side.

And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the quantity that is burned be half the thickness of the skin, without addition: and let the patient stand on their feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If, however, the patient is unable to stand, then let them lie down with their legs extended and their arms raised.

When the abscess bursts and you want to know whether it is in the flesh of the liver or its membrane, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, a pain and weight without sharpness comes upon the patient; but if it is in the membrane of the liver, along with the pain there is severe sharpness. And you see that his physicians have been tired out by his treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, the patient should lie on his back.

And burn with it once until the whole skin is burned and reaches the abscess, until all the pus comes out; then treat him with the treatment of bursts until he heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it is not appropriate for someone to use this kind of cautery unless his study in the art of medicine has been prolonged and through whose hands these diseases have often passed with experience; then indeed he may dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But to leave it alone is better in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said: for cold pleurisy, use a cautery with the roots of Aristolochia in this manner. eben
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is done by taking from the dried roots of Aristolochia a root longer than the others that can be found there, and let its thickness be like that of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize with one cautery between the continuation of the furcula and the neck, and with two small cauteries slanting downwards towards that which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two more cauteries slanting downwards towards the back between the fifth and sixth ribs; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And three more cauteries from behind: one between the two scapulae; and two below that cautery which is between the two scapulae.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not necessary to press the hand with the cautery, but rather let it be in plain sight, giving off its scent on the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some ancient authorities have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron like a needle, and they heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and pus comes out, as we have said concerning the hepatic abscess.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula results which cannot be healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 § On Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you are treating an illness of the spleen, according to what we have said about the division of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then there are three ways to cauterize it, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 The first is to make three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen, following the shape of the liver cauteries whose figure we have described earlier.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And between each cautery there should be the thickness of a finger or a little more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 And the method of cauterizing should be as we have described for the liver cautery, equally so.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press down with the cautery, and let the patient be lying on their back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 And another method of cauterization is as follows: Heat the cautery that has two prongs, which we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the arm; and raise the skin that lies directly over the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches; and let your raising of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then introduce the two red-hot prongs until you pierce through the skin from the other side; then withdraw the cautery. Thus, four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery that has three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then take care of the cautery after you have released it to discharge pus for many days, for it is more beneficial than any other previous treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 On the Method of Cauterizing for Hydrops.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 The cautery does not work in hydrops except when used on the affected area itself. />
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat a hydroptic patient with the treatment methods mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not take effect, then it is necessary to cauterize him four times around the navel, and once on the stomach, and once on the liver, and once on the spleen, and twice on the back between the shoulders, and one directly over the chest, and another directly over the stomach. And let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.  />
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then leave the cautery open so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not evacuate the patient from treatment after the cautery, for two benefits are added to him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the caustic used to burn the stomach should be like a key; and that used for burning the back should be like an olive leaf, as described above.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When they become swollen in a dropsical patient and fill with yellowish water, you should cauterize above the sole of the foot, which is between the auricular and annular bones; and lift up your hand with the caustic, and do not twist it; then lift up your hand, and do not press it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 For the yellowish water will ooze out, and let the caustic be of this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two caustics on each of the two legs, and let the caustic be with a knife-shaped tip; and let the caustic be as long as the leg, one below the knee and the other lower than that, about halfway down the leg. And make two caustics on each hip. And leave the caustic open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may ooze out from it; then treat it along with the others we have mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 On the method of cauterizing to relieve abdominal pain.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When there is abdominal pain due to cold and moisture, which weakens the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with remedies but does not heal; and you see that the patient can tolerate a strong caustic, then cauterize him strongly on his stomach, as described before for the method of cauterizing the stomach with a circular caustic, and four subtle caustics around the navel, with a subtle key-shaped caustic; and a large caustic over the groin above the testicles, or two caustics. 
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see abundant moisture and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize with a hot iron over the comb and a hot iron over each eye; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the great vein.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 For indeed is a treatment that is successful, whose benefit does not go astray.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 ¶ On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or just one, from thick, cold humors, or corrupt humidity, and they are treated as we have said in division, but no cure is effective; then cauterize with three hot irons on the lower back of the spine under the almieda briefly in a triangular shape, and with one hot iron under the navel about two finger-widths.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that his stomach is chilled and he cannot digest food, and you see his face swollen; then cauterize him with a large hot iron on the stomach as before, and with one on his liver, another on his spleen, together with a clavicle cautery. Leave the cautery open for some time, then treat him until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 ¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Anus After Their Excision.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you cut out a hemorrhoid, then heat a hot iron that resembles a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then insert the glowing iron into the cut hemorrhoid, and with your hand press until the hot iron reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If therefore the hemorrhoids are many, then cauterize each one with a hot iron as we have narrated. xspace
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with that which is beneficial for them from the ointments until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over the cataract, it is more effective for treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 On the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the patient does not comply with the incision and operation that we have described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he will be cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 Therefore, when someone has an anal fistula and it becomes chronic, pus runs from it, along with corrupting moisture.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 It is more appropriate, therefore, to probe it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then recognize its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray [of light].
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then introduce the heated cautery into the fistula itself and the amount of depth that the probe entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupt bodies are burnt away, once, or twice, or three times, according to your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And beware of burning the nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the bladder body, or the intestine body, then beware of all these places. ︎
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and know that it does not penetrate deeply.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 But if the place seals up and matter separates from it, and it remains like this for a long time; then know that it has already been completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if matter does not separate from it, then know that it is deep-seated, or there is a corrupt opening within it, or something like this; whose reminder will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or excessive flatulence, and it lessens because of this weakness of the patient, then you should cauterize him above the almenthenem on the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over each kidney with a small cautery, which comes before the remembrance.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we will cauterize him a second time in that same place.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why will three lines appear?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, they will be more effective in the end.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 § On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When there is weakness and softening of the bladder from cold and moisture, to the point that the patient cannot hold urine, then you should cauterize him on the lower part of the abdomen over the bladder where the hairs of the pubis begin, with a cautery from the right side of the abdomen and another from the left. And let the length of this cauterization be according to the width of the thumb joint; and you should cauterize him with a lower back cautery or with two if you need them; and it should be as the small cautery comes before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 § On the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When there is cold and moisture in the uterus, which prevents impregnation and corrupts its menses, delaying their onset, and causing pain during their arrival, then it should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel as we have said for the bladder, and with a cautery over the alcatim on the lower back, or with two if necessary; and let the cautery be small.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 § On the method of cauterizing the ankle in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When mucous humors flow to the ankle and cause it to leave its place; and the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other when compared, and the place of dislocation is found empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 It is therefore necessary to cauterize the patient over a box of Anchae with a similar cautery circle. After marking it with wax around the box as it turns, so that the box itself falls into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the cautery be of the form which has been described for the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not available to you, then use three cauteries: a large olive-oil cautery and make the depth of the cautery according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 § On Cauterizing for Sciatica
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the bladder and its cause is cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division of humors, but it does not help and the disease persists, then you must free the patient from thick humors with stinking pills or artificial pills and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cautery is according to two methods: either a cautery with drying medicines or a cautery with fire. xspace
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 A cautery with fire is done in many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of these methods is to cauterize over the bladder itself with three triangular cauteries in this shape. ️
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make them of good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And let the space between each cautery be the size of a thick finger, and let the cautery be made with olive oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes, however, the cautery is done in the middle over the head of the bladder itself. ️ ️ ️
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form has been described for the cauterization of bladder dislocation, do so with one, so that the circle contains the entire bladder.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 "And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method of cautery for sciatica when the pain clings to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize with two cauteries over the hip, on the spot where the patient indicates that the pain is, and your cautery four fingerbreadths towards the tendon briefly; and let the cautery be knife-like.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 But if the patient indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes of the foot, then cauterize there where he indicates with a point or three, or four, or more, as needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 And if the patient indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize there with one knife-like cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And beware in all your cautery that you do not go with the cautery to the point of burning a large nerve or artery and thereby draw a harmful disease or contraction upon the patient.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And indeed I myself have seen one and another of those who cauterized over the tendon and carried the cautery to completion, and their leg swelled up until a tumor reached the foot and the whole thing burst, and the entire foot was corrupted; then came an opening in the belly, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 But if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And some wise men said in the cautery of the hip, whose method this is.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a similar awl from iron, whose diameter is half the width of a palm; and at its opening let there be according to the thickness of an almond, or slightly less; and inside that awl let there be a third awl.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let there be a space between each samium equal to the thickness of the thumb; and let the samia be open on both sides; and let their height be like that of a knot, or two knots; and make for them a handle from iron, well fitted into the samia.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it should be heated in the fire until it turns red and sparks fly out; then it should be placed on a weak patient's side, above the healthy part of the chest.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Therefore, cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterwards, apply plasters with butter; and let the wound remain open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Albucasis said: "O my son, we have used this kind of cautery little because of the frightening appearance of it; and also, because few can bear its application.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 However, for him who endures, it is among the good cauteries, and he who finds a place for it will be successful with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 The cautery is also made with adherent medicines, such that you should make two samia having a perforated armilla, into which descends the pin of its door, either from bronze or iron, as long as the wall; whose height should be two knots, or similar to them.  />
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let the space between the two be the thickness of a finger; and let them be open below and above; and let them contain each other in this manner.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it on the chest of a weak patient lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand firmly against the chest.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour between the two samia warm water which has been heated a little by fire, and hold it for an hour; and let the patient endure its burning and its scorching, for he will find the burning like fire until the burning ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then lift your hand with the instrument and wash away all the hot water from the wound with sweet water; then leave it alone for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And put butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed; and leave it for some days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 For it is most helpful in treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 But if the pain extends to the hip or thigh, make for him a bath in which there is water, as you did for the wound, in the same way.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written it down in the chapter on rectifying medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take soda and unslaked lime in equal parts; grind both of them finely and put them in a new pot whose bottom is pierced with one small hole through which the liquid can pass, and under the bottom of the pot place another glass pot, and pour over the soda and lime sweet water so that it covers both by a finger's width; then press them firmly with your hand; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then collect all that water and pour it over another lime; and strain it through a cloth until it is clear.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For then it will be very strong, which is used in many operations of medicine and in the cautery of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it performs the action of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medicines that are used to cauterize wounds, there is also terebinth resin and almond oil and lime mixed with soap.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And indeed Galen reported the cure of a certain ancient man, by which he was cured of pain in his wound and sciatic vein; and he praised it greatly. 》
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that no other treatment was needed, and that he was cured after one application until he reported that perhaps he had entered a bath house and came out of it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And take it from a green sebet plant: and if you cannot find it fresh, take the dried kind, recently harvested. Grind it very finely with some fat, and place it on the ulcer where there is pain, either on the leg or in the hip. Bind it, and leave it on for three hours, or however long the patient feels relief from the burning sensation.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then introduce him to a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes sweaty, place him on a stool.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For the pain subsides and he is cured.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines unless after purging the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides said that goat dung, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, helps it: and this is how you make the cautery.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep place that is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle bone, which is closer to the ankle bone.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat dung and burn it in a fire until it becomes charcoal. ›
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place the charcoal on the wool and leave it until it goes out.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then repeat that process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not cease to do this until the sensation reaches the ulcer and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cautery is called the goat dung cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 ¶ On the Cautery for Back Pain
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter Forty-Four.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Sometimes back pain occurs due to many causes, such as injury, a blow, or excessive purging, and similar things, from the infusion of cold, wet matter. And indeed, cautery is only indicated in this particular case, which is caused by the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 It is therefore necessary after the evacuation of the patient with foul-smelling pills and similar ones that three lines be made on the back where it hurts, according to the width of the almeidat itself, after marking with a cautery in each line five or more burns, as many as come from the strength of the patient's tolerance. And let the cauterization be done with a cautery point.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using the middle of a nail-shaped cautery according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 On the method of cauterizing an incipient hump.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This illness often happens to small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 And the sign of its onset in children is that a stricture occurs in their breath as they rise and move, and it is found in the last vertebrae of the back and in its nodes, which have already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see it and wish to do this, then cauterize with a circular cautery according to this method.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And let the cautery take hold of each part of the vertebrae equally. If you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a point cautery, make two or three lines and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for the place until it heals with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And beware of applying a cautery to a hump caused by a nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 On the method of cauterizing gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow into any part of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, according to the custom of physicians, they properly name it gout.  ()
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 When treating gout caused by cold with remedies and the pain is not removed, then a cautery will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it should be that he is cauterized after purging around the joint of the foot with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive oil-based.
Cuius haec est forma.	 Whose form is this.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you need to prick on the surface of the foot, then do it with a small pricking iron.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize him on every knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, using the same clavile iron.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 But if you need more of this cautery, then cauterize him again.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not plunge your hand with the cautery; rather let it be about as thick as the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 But if the pain ascends to the knees and back, then administer what we said about the cautery in its own chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 But if the pain is only in the hands, then prick around the joints as two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 But if any pain remains in the fingers, then prick them on every joint with a single prick, and also on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 But if after days the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not purge the patient from a good diet and from taking medication.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if a good regimen is followed and the phlegm is purged, he will be healed with God's help by means of this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine or scrotum descends to the testicle, and this is an urgent case, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to abstain from food for that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And let him use laxatives so that his stool may pass from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then let him sit between your hands on his back; and instruct him to hold his breath until it comes out, or a turd appears, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then reduce him with your fingers, and mark the place of the rupture above the anus with a cautery, with a mark whose end is like half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then apply fire to the cautery until pus comes out and it throws off scabs.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then reduce the intestine or turd back to its natural place.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then have the assistant place his hand over the site to prevent the intestine from exiting; and you have now opened between the patient's thighs and placed a pillow underneath, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery over that mark, with your hand holding the cautery upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold him until you reach his mouth with it; or repeat the process with another if you have not reached the mouth on the first try.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And be mindful of the exit of the intestine during your cautery, lest you burn it and cause death or great harm to the patient through it.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your work is in vain.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it is necessary for the cautery of infants to be fine, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with other ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound closes.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 And it is necessary that you provide his food during the time of his treatment, so that it may soften his belly; so that the intestine does not come out at the attempt or discharge.  />
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then, when he wants to get up after forty days, give him a well-made bandage and let him keep it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And let him be kept from labor, and from filling his stomach with food and drink, and from loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when he follows this treatment, he is healed by a complete cure.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I will describe the treatment of hernias with incisions in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 But when hernias occur in the rest of the abdomen and are beginning and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize his hernia with a round cautery according to its size: and let what is burnt be one-third of it. )))
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then treat him as we have said, and there will be no increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is marked with the cautery, and a line is placed which is along its width on the upper side of the hernia, and another line below it.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautery is easier and better. ))) )))
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing for pains from a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When there is pain in certain members from a fall or blow, and the pain persists for a long time, and medicine does not help it, then it must be cauterized with a point-shaped cautery. ))) ))) )))
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And let the cautery be of every member according to its size and thinness and weakness and strength, and where the blow or pain is from that. ))) ))) ))) )))
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If he is healed from the first cautery, that is good. ))) ))) ))) ))) ))) )))
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 "If not, then repeat on that same cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because it is the custom of these pains to pass from one member to the next adjacent one.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore you should follow them with a cautery until the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 § On the manner of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Sometimes lepers are greatly helped by cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And especially the kind of leprosy that comes from the corruption of phlegm and black bile. When you wish to cauterize it, be mindful of this.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If the leprosy is in its beginning stage and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it does not descend or stop; and you fear for the patient that corruption may overcome his entire complexion; then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, a second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, two above each temple, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And finally, place your hand with the cautery briefly on it, so that it makes a small impression on the skin and causes the scabs to detach from it; this will relieve the exhalation of thick vapors from it. Also cauterize the spleen itself as we have previously described.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly visible; then you must cauterize with these cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on each cheek, and two on each side of the neck, and six on each side of the back, and a large one on the scrotum at the root of the penis and one above it in the bellybutton; and two on each shoulder blade, that is, with one on each shoulder blade and two on each knee: one on each knee and two on each elbow, and two on each wrist, and two on each side of his chest. And cauterize him on every joint among the joints of the fingers of both his hands and feet; and cauterize on each heel of his feet and on each palm of his hands.  />
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes it is cauterized with a hot iron over the pubic bone, and another over the xiphoid process of the sternum, and another over the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And know that the more you apply the hot iron, it is more beneficial and effective.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And know that the sick person does not feel pain from the hot iron as much as a healthy person would, because their body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 And the hot irons should be made according to size and shape for different limbs and joints, as has been mentioned in the types of surgical instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the wounds with a poultice made from ground herbs and honey, and continue other treatments until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 On the Method of Cauterizing When Someone is Insensible.
Caput L.	 Book One
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a limb becomes insensible and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the insensible limb with hot irons, according to the size or shape of the limb.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your hot iron penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 And sometimes it is cauterized for the numbness that occurs in the hand or foot, at the spine of the back near where the nerves that move that limb emerge; and the numbness will be removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not attempt this unless you are knowledgeable in the dissection of limbs and the exit points of the nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 On the Method of Cauterizing for Whitlows.
Caput LI.	 Book Fifty-One
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When a whitlow becomes old and nothing helps it from the healing arts, then cauterize it slightly with a deep hot iron according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with herb flour and lentils with rose oil, and arnoglossa leaves, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: let there be an equal part of each. Let all these be mixed together and smeared on a cloth, and adhere to the place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 On the method of cauterizing in cancer.
Caput LII.	 Chapter 52
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When the cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as if turning [a wheel].
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 But this does not seem right to me, because I fear that it will cause an ulceration; and indeed I have seen this happen many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 And it is more appropriate to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 On the method of cauterizing in abscesses.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter 53
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has an abscess and it is delayed in ripening, either because of the excess humour causing it, or because of the weakness of the patient when they are elderly and have little blood, or because of the time and the desire to hasten the ripening of the abscess, then cauterize around its circumference with many small puncturing cauteries.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For it will hasten in ripening on its own.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 But if you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this form: ¶ [A drawing of the cautery may be included here.]
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And place it in the middle of the abscess, until it penetrates the skin. Let the cautery be from the weakest patient, so that the course of pus may be facilitated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 About the method of cauterizing in malignant ulcers.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter 46.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 The ulcer is nothing but corruption moving through the limb, and it eats away at that limb, just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 Therefore, if you see an ulcer in a place that can bear cautery with fire, then burn it much with fire, both small and large cauteries, according to what is suitable for the place where the ulcer is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it on all sides until you have completely removed all the corruption and nothing of it remains at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then leave it for three days, and place ground sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized places, until all the scabs are removed and all corruption is eliminated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then treat it with flesh-generating ointments.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 Therefore, if you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good. ️
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery on whatever remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 And the ulcer should be treated at times with sharp medicine. ️
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 For it arises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, cautery with fire is of swifter help; and I have already spoken of its cauterization with sharp medicine in the division; therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 ¶ About the method of cauterizing in nails and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 Many times this illness occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a thick, rough substance that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 And there are two types of cautery in them: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the one with fire, use a concave cautery like a vulture's feather, made of iron according to the size that can contain the nail from all sides; and let it have thin edges. ️ ️ ️
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the heated instrument on the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail, and leave it for three days until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply a plaster with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 It will be uprooted from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 But if they do not convert and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then administer the cautery with hot water. And it is that you take a tube made of bronze, or iron, or from a vulture's feather, and place it on the nail, or althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube; hold your hand and rotate it with some pressure for a short while, so that the edge of the tube is impressed on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail; and let the patient wait for an hour over the biting of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then leave it, for the nail will be uprooted with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do this one after another until you have treated all those that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then care for them after they have been uprooted with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing in tremors.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 61.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When trembling occurs to someone from cold in the nerves, or from tertian fever, or something else, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and on his stomach a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The tremor quiets with oil cautery, and health quickly returns from cold illness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 On the manner of cauterizing according to Albathar.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes Albathar expels foul things from the body, that is, pustules which are formed from coarse corrupt matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, as soon as they appear, they should be cauterized with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, the end of which is set on fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. ︎
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized with the adenoma at the beginning of its expulsion in this manner, and they do not increase; and the excess causing them is broken up, and they heal from it.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, that should be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 On the manner of cauterizing a wound to stop bleeding from an artery.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter 58. ︎
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 It often happens that there is bleeding from an artery cut in a wound, which occurs externally or during the incision of an aposteme, or of a member's cautery, and similar to these; and it is difficult to cut it off.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 Therefore, when this happens to someone, quickly bring your hand to the opening of the artery and place your index finger on it. And press it hard until the blood is blocked under your finger and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then put a small oil cautery and several large ones into the fire, and blow on them until they are very hot. ︎ ︎
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is cut, and put the cautery on the vein itself after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If the clot is expelled by raising the finger from the orifice of the artery and extinguishing the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore, do not stop doing it with one after another until the blood is stopped.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And beware lest you burn the nerve that is there and another evil befall the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop it unless by one of four means, especially if the artery is large.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Either with a cautery, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is extracted, its ends contract and the blood stops.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or let it be tied with a strong thread.  /> Et scias quod hoc potest fieri in omni loco corporis, praeter caput et manibus, quoniam ibi non est uiuentem, sed mortuam carnem.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or apply to it medicines that have the property of stopping blood, and bind it with a decent bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 But he who applies its stopping with a ligature and tightening with cloth or the application of burning substances and similar things does not help it at all, except rarely.  /> Sed quando arteria est parua, tunc possunt abscindere sanguinem per unam de his quatuor rebus, nisi quando est in capite vel in collo.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 But if this happens to someone and there is no physician present or medicine, then let him begin with the position of the finger on the orifice of the vein itself, as we have said, and very tight binding until the blood is stopped from above the wound and onto the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And do not remove the finger, and pour cold water of very intense cold over it until the blood freezes and thickens and stops.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile, he should consider what is needed from a cautery or from medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 On Incision, Perforation, and Bloodletting in Wounds and Similar Conditions.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 We have already said in the first chapter about every illness in which it is suitable to use hot iron or burning medicine, its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cautery.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And there I placed chapters from the head to the feet.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that it may ease the search for its questioner.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to know, O sons, that in this chapter there is a similarity to what is in the first chapter about cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And because of this, greater care is necessary, because in the operation that is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, which stands at the opening of a vein, or incision above an abscess, or opening of an exit wound, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision above a stone, and similar things: all of these are associated with trembling, fear, and death occurs in many of them.  />
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you not to allow doubt to fall upon you, for sometimes people with various illnesses come to you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 Among them is one who becomes angry with his illness, and for him death is light because of the intensity of what he finds from his illness and the length of its evil.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And with his illness is fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And among them is one who gives you his flute and enriches you with it, hoping for health, but his illness is deadly.  />  />  />
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 It is not appropriate for you to agree with the one who comes to you with such a method.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 Let your caution be greater than your greed and your impatience.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume over anything from it, unless after a certain knowledge which verifies to you the praiseworthy outcome to which it has come.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And use in the treatment of all your patients prediction and indication concerning that to which it is suitable for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For in this you have assistance towards gaining fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God inspire you, sons, with His understanding, and may He not take away your guidance and inspiration from you, for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this Chapter by dividing it into sections, following what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that your search for what you want from it and need may be made easier.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 ¶ On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	 Chapter I
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this illness often happens to children at birth or when the midwife tightly grasps the child's head without gentleness. ‌
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And sometimes it happens also for an unknown cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And I myself have not seen this illness in anyone other than children, and every one of them that I saw died quickly because of it; therefore, it seemed to me to pass over treating it. ‌
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And I myself saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled every day until he could no longer sit up because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And this moisture either collects between the skin and bone or accumulates beneath the bone on the skull (cranium).
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation in it, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make one slit in the middle of the head; and let the length of the slit be like two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of the instrument.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If, therefore, the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then make those two slits according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides; and water sinks when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide itself from you: then you should make three slits in the middle of the head according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then bind the slits with cloths and wool.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then dress it on top with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with soft linens and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not stop binding the head evenly.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 And feed the patient with all dry food of little moisture, until the part is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 And another method of incision is that you should observe where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 For sometimes it is more on the back of the head, or on the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore, with your incision go to where you see the abscess and the collection of water; and cut it according as is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And take care not to cut an artery, lest blood flow out and the patient die from that flow along with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 ¶ About the Incision of the Arteries that are behind the ears. ›
Caput II.	 Chapter 2
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When someone has catarrh in the eyes or chest and it becomes chronic, and medical treatment is of no benefit, then the final treatment for that person is to cut these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when you wish to cut them, it is necessary for the patient to shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become apparent.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the patient tie his own neck with any of his own cloths. ‌
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then observe where the pulse of the vein is felt.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And the locations of both are in the depressed areas behind the ears, and rarely are they hidden except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark both locations with hot iron and cut each with a sharp razor, making the incision reach the bone: and do this across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, insert the razor under the artery and cut it from above with the same incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' width joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps frequently to the inner parts. ‌
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 But if the artery is not perceived by touch, then measure from the ear the distance of three fingers' width.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with hot iron and find it down to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And that which should be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will emit more or less than that.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 All of this according to the amount which appears to you from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery. ‌ ‌
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then observe at the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 Then if there is anything left at the bone from the scab, cut it away so that a hot abscess does not occur. Then bind the wound with cloths of linen fabric.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 About the extraction of the temporal arteries.
Caput III.	 Chapter 3
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When someone has an old migraine or severe cold due to the acrid humors and heat in the temples, or when it is a severe old headache of a similar nature, and medical treatments are applied according to their methods but do not help: then we have found, through experience with these illnesses, that extracting the temporal arteries or cauterizing them, as we have described, is effective.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method for extracting them is as follows: let the patient shave off the hair on their temples and expose the visible temporal artery.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 For it is made apparent to you by its own pulse, and rarely does it remain hidden except in a few people or during severe cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 But if it is hidden from you, then have the patient tie their head with any cloth they have; afterwards, rub the area with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or apply steam to the area with hot water until it appears clearly before you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the spatula that I mentioned earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then use it to easily peel away the skin until you reach the artery. 🙂
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then insert the hook into it and pull it upwards until you have extracted it from the skin and made it exit completely from all the underlying layers. 😊
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 But if the artery is thin, then wrap it around the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut off a section according to how much the ends can be extended and contracted without causing any bleeding.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut or severed, the blood will not rise at all. 😊
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then evacuate from the blood vessel six ounces of blood until three remain. 😊
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: then you must tie it in two places with double-threaded, strong silk or gut string, so that putrefaction does not rush to the wound before its healing, and blood loss may occur.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut the excess between the two ties.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the edges are cut off, using a surgical knife; so that it may stand in the place of that operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And this is a better operation, unless the patient has a fever or a hot constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because a cautery is among those things which help to end moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore, it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the removal of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cloths, and fine bandages should be placed on top in a pleasing manner.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the dissolution, it should be cleaned with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with ointments, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If during the operation blood flows from the artery, then quickly cut it with a cautery or fill the place with tow; and keep your hand pressed until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 But if you do not have either of these at hand, then place your finger over the spot until the blood clots.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And soak the place with very cold water, until the sharpness subsides and it is bound as needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And because it is easier and simpler to extract the vein by cauterizing it with this double-bladed cautery; let the sharpness of the two blades be like an almagdal.  />And after placing the blade, burn until it reaches the second tie.  />And this operation should not be done without a ligature, lest putrefaction enter into the wound before its healing.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 Truly, they are much sharper than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 For if they were sharp like two knives, the cold would hasten to both; and they would not cut flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained within them, and flesh is cut quickly; thus this work is better than any other, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger after you mark two places with cautery; and place both of them very hot until they reach the mouth, and cut the vein in two places so that what is between its ends is lengthened.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 For they do not fully coalesce with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 ¶ On the care for acute and persistent tear flow from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When tears are persistent and their flow comes from the veins that are outside on top of the head, and medical treatment with medicines does not help them, and you see the face of the sick person already redden, and he feels in his forehead a sensation like the movement of ants: and his eyes are emaciated, moist, so much so that their hair is corroded by the corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears; then the ancients needed this operation for their treatment, and they named it a cure with the sword. 》
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And you should advise the sick person to shave the hair from his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three equally spaced cuts in the forehead along its length; and let the length of each cut be like two fingers, and one cut should be halfway along the nose on the middle of the forehead, and the second one should be a little way from the movement of the temples, and the third one on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides; and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all the cuts be the size of three connected fingers; and have ready a piece of sponge, or many dry cloths, with which you may absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert a thin reed with two sharp ends, the shape of which is shown next.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the incision near the temple to the second incision; and scrape off with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the flesh that is over the mouth.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do likewise from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove that reed and insert another instrument into the first incision, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side and not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place the sharp edge towards the attached flesh with the skin, and the smooth edge towards the mouth; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut along with it all the blood vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, except that the incision continues to what is visible on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure. ●
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And after an equal amount of blood has run out, press upon the places where the blood is clotted.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place a liniment of old lard into every fissure, and upon them put little poultices soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And see to it that no hot abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day, release the bandage, and administer a large quantity of infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with balm ointment and the other things by which wounds are treated until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 ¶ On the treatment of acute tears and colds that come to the eyes from inside the head.
Caput V.	 Chapter V
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone has acute and painful catarrhs that are persistent: and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their sight already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and the hairs fall out from them, and there is an acute pain in the depth of the head, causing distress, and sneezing follows: then know from these signs that those humors and catarrhs do not come except from many veins. ● ● ●
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 And a better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it is, as you would advise the patient to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make an incision in that fissure one in the middle of the forehead or slightly to one side according to its width, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right: and let the cut go as far as the mouth; and keep your hand away from the temples which move during chewing until the mouth is revealed; and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate between the two lips of the incision with an old cloth or with linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then bind it above with little woolen bands; and moisten the woolen bands with wine and oil so that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you loose that [bandage], and you see that the hot abscess is already diminishing, then it is necessary for you to scrub the mouth until flesh begins to grow there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then care for the patient with a drying diet that causes flesh to grow, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and prepare from them an ointment, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 ¶ On the care of what falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	 Chapter Six.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water and vinegar and things similar to them; or some sort of animal.  />
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 Therefore, when a stone or something of the kind that does not grow nor is added [to the ear] falls into it, expose the ear to the sun; and if you see the stone, then pour into the ear some oil of violets or sesame oil.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer an extraction and make him sneeze with condiments, and close the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you have placed pieces of cloth or wool around the ear and stretched the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 Often indeed it goes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 But if it does not go out, then administer the extraction of it with Gesty, that is, fine pizigares; the shape of which is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If therefore it goes out with gesty, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a fine blunt hook of few folds.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it does not go out through that, then make a tube of bronze and insert the end of the tube deeply into the ear hole, and close what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no way for air except through the tube: then extract with a strong exhalation.  />
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 Often indeed it goes out with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 But if it does not go out this way, then take from hekalimbat or from visco, that is, prepared glue with which birds are caught, a small amount; and place it on the end of a stick after you have wound over it a cotton cloth neatly placed: then insert it into the ear hole easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.  />  />
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If it does not go out with all that we have described, then hasten to cut open, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 And the method of cutting is to bleed the sick person first in the cephalic vein, and extract from him blood according to his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and find a small opening at the root of the ear in its fatty part in a depressed place itself; and let the opening be lunar-shaped, until you reach the stone: then remove it with what is possible for you from instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then wash the opening from your hour with speed and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 But if what falls into the ear is one of those seeds that grow and swell: then you should extract it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not come out on its own, then take a thin, fine probe in this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And apply with it the removal of that kind of seed which falls into the ear and does not come out when you think the seed is already moistened by the heat of the ear, until you break it up into many pieces: then remove those pieces with a hook or with a fine probe or with suction, as we said, for its removal is made easier.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In the case of water which enters the ear, it is necessary for the sick person to sneeze first, and already his ear has been filled with some old cooked food: and he lies down on that ear in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If it therefore comes out through it, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not: then take many stones the length of a finger, thin and smooth, and heat them briefly with fire, and let the sick person insert one into the opening of his ear: and he should jump on one foot, and strike the stone which is in the ear with another stone.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Do not therefore cease to do this with stones until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water comes out so that you take one of reed or rush and insert its end into the ear: and light the other end with fire until it is almost consumed.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reed and do this many times until all the water comes out: and remove it with a syringe as previously described for the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 But in the case of an animal entering it, if it is small-bodied like a flea, care for it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 "But if it is of the body's main part and is noticeable to the senses, then administer its removal with tweezers and hooks, and its resolution is easier than all those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 "However, when treating a worm born in the ear, if you care for it with what we mentioned in division and in dealing with fumigation, your treatment is of no use; then you must look at the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 "Therefore, if something appears there from the worms, then remove it with tweezers or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 "But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula whose form is such that it is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top; insert its fine tip into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; then suck with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 "Do this many times until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 "But if they do not obey you in coming out, then coat the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said about the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 "But if they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the fumigations which the ancients have already experienced in killing worms; and you will find it in the section on fumigations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 "And let your pouring be with which you pour oil and medicine into the ear using this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 "As you see, make it of silver or bronze, narrow below where there is a small hole, and wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 "So let the plunger that is within the hollow of the cannula be made neatly of iron.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 "And if you wish, take a reed and wrap its tip with cotton in a neat layer; then pour oil or juice, or whatever you want from these medicines into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the reed with the cotton on top, and press it gently with your hand until the oil is forced into the hollow of the ear, and the patient feels it inside; and let what is poured into the ear already be slightly heated by fire; and take care that what is distilled into it is not very cold; for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 The care of the accidental fall of gold.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it has happened to some people that the fall of gold occurs in the ear canal from a wound or flesh born within it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this fall of gold sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which vision cannot follow; and sometimes it happens near the outer edge of the ear canal, and vision follows it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear and which sight does not grasp is difficult to cure in most cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in that which vision follows, you must place the ear of the patient in the sun and look into it; then if you see an apparent fall of gold, open it with a fine spatula, whose form is as follows: let its tip be small in width, of which one part should be sharp, and let the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides so that it does not injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If, however, the fall of gold is from flesh born within the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 But if the fall of gold is deep within the ear, then take a fine, smooth wire and heat it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal. ething.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you feel the fall of gold with it, which the patient finds with difficulty of hearing, strive to open it with ease; and beware lest you wound the nerve of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place in the ear a piece of linen according to the width of the ear canal, which you have rolled in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are confident about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen and pour rose water over it, and sprinkle finely ground sarsaparilla over it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear already infected with boils: then you must extract the pus, and allow it to be covered with another poultice, which you will wrap in a cloth that has been made with rose oil, until the hot abscess is settled; then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If there is bleeding: then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear; and use the rest of the treatment which cuts off the aforementioned bleeding in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 About the care for sty in the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter Eight
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These styes that occur in the eyelids of the eye are sometimes wet and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or with a hook, and cut them off at their roots with a scalpel.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place powdered sulfur on the places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If there is bleeding from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And it is better to cauterize after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For often they return when some of their roots remain.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return. )))
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 About the care for chalazions in the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	 Chapter Nine
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often there occurs in the eyelids something which resembles a chalazion in its strength and hardness, and on account of this it is called "grain"; and it is an accumulation of thick fluid in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 The treatment for them is to observe whether the grain has developed inside it, as can be seen from the eyelid, and they move in every direction, and its nature is easy. ))) )))
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Then find a slit of equal width on it.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then peel it from every part with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 But if its cutting is not prepared for you until after you penetrate the eyelid with a slight cut, then that harms the patient somewhat.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 But if the opening is large: then join it with stitches and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 For an ointment restores it and makes it fleshy again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 And if the grain is inclined towards the inner surface of the ear, then turn back the eyelid and hang the grain with a hook, except that you need to make a cut and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 But if the eyelid is lengthened by the cut, this causes no harm at all. 》
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then wash the eye after removing the grain with salt water and care for the place with what makes it fleshy until the patient heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 ¶ About treating trachoma of the eyelids.
Caput X.	 Chapter 10
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 Chapter X. Trachoma is a fat that forms in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and this happens especially to children. It weighs down their eyes, they get colds in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sun because tears rush into them. For this reason you see them constantly lying on their faces, and sleeping on them. Their eyelids are wet under their eyebrows, which inflammation has already covered; and a visible Axirnath appears to the eye. And when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of treatment is for the patient to put his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a cloth of flax, and prepare bandages in it, and make from them a circular bandage according to the size that contains Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place it on top of it and press it with your fingers on every side, so that Axirnath is collected in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the middle of that wetness a small opening with an incision knife across its width, and let the cut not be deeper than that made in bloodletting.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or you should look for the whole skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many cases Axirnath proceeds from the cut according to the shape of a white piece of fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Therefore extract it with the cloth that you have put between your fingers on the outside; and you roll your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add anything into the cut so that you do not reach with the knife to the eye, and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 But if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the cut, then you should add a little into the cut with ease until Axirnath proceeds out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and bind it with small bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are some people who grind salt and place it on the cut so that whatever remains of that wetness is dissolved.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 But if a hot abscess occurs in that place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 ¶ About the kinds of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye becomes soft, so that it blinks as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond their natural course and are ignored, they harm the eye and cause various illnesses such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and cataracts, eventually leading to the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 The treatment of ataxia of the eye is carried out in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Either by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with a sharp instrument, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.  />
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Or ataxia of the eye is treated by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 Or by means of reeds, as I will explain.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 You should place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then, with your left hand, turn back the eyelid of the eye.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it is turned back, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 If not, insert a needle with thread from the lower part of the eyelid and make the needle penetrate with the thread above it, near the hair itself, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow; then pull the thread upwards with the eyelid and turn it back with a rod.  />  />
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find, within the eyelid under the added hairs, with a small spoon from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then pull out the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid; then mark the eyelid with wax in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the size and thickness of the eyelid; for it varies greatly among people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 There are some who need a large piece to be cut out of the eyelid, corresponding to the amount that is softened by the eyelid.  />  />  •
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then, when you find the eyelid space over the two lines that you have marked, begin from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct, and let there be one cut near the natural hairs, as thick as a finger.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then remove it completely.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then join the two lips with stitches using a fine woolen thread and a needle: clean away the blood, and make the excess threads stick together above the two eyebrows with some adhesive substances, if you wish to do so; but if not, it does not matter.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then leave the stitches and threads for three or four days; afterwards, treat it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and treat it with something that dries and closes it.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid will be raised at the sealing of the wound and its joining, but it will be better afterwards.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 Ancient people taught this method of treatment to Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is concern for the patient in this, and it comes from good treatment; there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is also found in Ataxmir, and it is to mark a shape on the eyelid like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then raise the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks according to this following shape; then cut away the excess with small scissors according to this shape, with an equal depth of cut.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 But if you cannot hold the hook and it does not match up, then take a needle with thread in it and insert it in the middle of the shape; and insert another thread near the greater tear duct and a second thread near the lesser tear duct; and gather the threads between your fingers with equal tension. 
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then raise your hand with an equal lift: and raise the skin above which the knot is marked, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind together the two lips of the wound with a stitch: and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 But if an abscess occurs at your incision or cut: stitch that abscess with a suture and similar things from the soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes it happens to the eyelids as well, so that its hairs turn inward.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore you must use what we have said about the incision; but the stitch is more artful for both [eyelids].
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 ¶ On the care of trachoma with conjunctivitis.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And it is [done] by turning back the eyelid and cutting the fissure that is inside, as I have said.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then skillfully make two cannulae or two fine sticks whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spindle. And you have already cut at the extremities of both from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then bind each one with care over that which protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and tie together both sticks from both sides with a strong knot, and leave it for several days. 》
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For the skin held tightly will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 Therefore, when it is consolidated, raise the eyelid: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the form of the two cannulae which you should make according to this figure and measure in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 ¶ On raising hairs that prick in the eye with a needle. 》
Caput XII.	 Chapter Twelve.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation for this is as follows: take a fine needle and insert into it a fine, soft silk thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then you will tie the ends together with two very fine knots; and the length of the threads should be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then prepare another fine thread under the Alinxotati in a short section, and if you wish, tie the ends together.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then let the patient place his head on your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation can be clearly seen; for this is a delicate or subtle operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you extract a natural hair from above. ↑
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then pull the hair up to just above the Alinxotati and insert that hair into the Alinxotati; if there is one, or two, or three, no more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati and the eyelid along with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 But if the Alinxotati is pulled out and the hair does not come out with it, pull the Alinxotati downwards with the thread that you prepared in it until the Alinxotati comes out of the upper hole, and you see it with your eyes; then you will pull the Alinxotati and the thread, and extract both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair with it from the natural hairs and lift it up together; or leave it until it lengthens over time, and then lift it up.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 ¶ On the care of the Alxatrati that occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this happens to the eye, it is called leprosy.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this leprosy is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 The accidental kind occurs from the healing of a wound, cut, or cautery, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 And the manner of operating on it is that you should cut through that healing, separate its edges, and place a linen thread between them, and tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 And it is not fitting to use things that dry and constrict in its treatment, for if you do this, the leprosy returns worse than before; rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek, embrocation with water in which althea and flax seed have been cooked, and diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil. And wrap a linen thread with it and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 And your treasure of treatment is to strive by all means that it does not heal according to the first form.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 And this operation which we have spoken of is nothing but a correction of the leprosy, so that the form of the place does not entirely return as it was before.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 ¶ On the treatment of leprosy which occurs on the lower eyelid and is a wrinkle or contraction upward toward the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This leprosy which occurs below is what is truly called leprosy.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 It is both natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental kind occurs from a wound, or cut, or cautery, and similar things. 
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 And the way of operating on it is that you should take a needle with a double thread, and dip it in ink, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches the two ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then stretch the flesh upwards with a needle, and cut it with a broad scalpel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the figure of the eyelid returns as is fitting, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take a thread and place it in the slit, and turn the eyelid with it. And find two slits on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two slits be from the two corners of the incision, until they meet and form a corner; until when they come together the figure will be like this figure, which is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that flesh in the amount that its sharp side is below that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then gather the separated parts: or sew them together with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with what we have said about softening ointments and linens until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if ectropion occurs from the slit or suture, or from cautery, then it is necessary to cut a flat slit under the eyelashes, even as has been said before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between the two lips with a linen thread, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 And the summary of the treatment for ectropion, whether it is above or below, is that this operation should be performed according to the preparation from the type of ectropion.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For indeed it [ectropion] is of many diverse forms; and a skilled craftsman prepares his ingenuity in whatever way is possible for him, so that he may bring the figure back to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 ¶ On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye and prevents its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, you should insert the tip of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula that is not sharp like the incision spatulas but rather slightly blunt so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and remove the spatula, lest it injure the eye with its sharpness. And let your incision be as if you were excoriating that adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural shape, and the entire adhesion heals.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then pour salt water into the eye and wash it with water, or distill onto it from a sieve made of crushed gum dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen cloth; and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after the third day, use a sieve and bandages until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 ¶ On the incision of the nail and the prominence of the tear gland.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Either it is nervous and similar to a dry sponge, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not nervous and similar to frozen white moisture; when this is touched with iron or you try to catch it with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not stick into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And both types do not begin except from the larger tear gland, until it gradually extends to cover the vision and prevent light and eye movement.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the way of operating in its incision is: so that the patient places his head in your lap. 》 》
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open his eyes, and raise his eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then gather the nail with a small hook, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take a needle and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, ox, or cow; and let the thread be strong, and slightly double the end of the needle, and place it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and remove the skin with the hair on the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you sew it with the hair to its very end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal gland with a fine scalpel or small scissors: and leave the natural lacrimal flesh as is, so that persistent tearing does not occur from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone; or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it should be scraped with a soft scalpel of this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And take care that the scalpel does not touch the corneal membrane, lest it cause a tear and pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, put some crushed salt or a sieved powder of ziniar into the eye, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for him with what is necessary until he is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it or fix a hook in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medications and heals as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the patient and take a thin, soft, and weakly sharpened scalpel of this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And scrape the surface of the nail with great fineness.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it becomes rarefied and fragmented, and a furrow is impressed upon it, then distill into the eye from an hourglass made of tin or red glass, or crushed salt: and fill the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the same procedure until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless there is a hot abscess in your eye; then leave that [procedure] alone and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure with the furrow until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 If the prominence of the tear-producing flesh causes great harm in the eye, hang it with a hook and cut off a portion of it; but do not finish the incision, so that the flow of tears may not be interrupted.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then distill into a red glass or tin hourglass until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 § On the Incision for Alguardenic and the Flesh Born in the Eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 Sometimes a red fleshy substance is born in the eyes of some people, either composed or placed over [the eye], until it covers the pupil or approaches it, or presses on the eyelids and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it resembles a rosebud.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the procedure for this is also that the patient should place his head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open his eyes and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks; and hold it with one forceps or tweezers. />
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And be careful of the eye, so that you do not harm it during the procedure; and let your incision by which you cut [the flesh] be either with a spatula, as we have described in the incision for a fingernail; or with small forceps, with which asebel is collected, according to its form after this chapter.  />  />
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your incision is complete and all the white of the eye has been removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt or sprinkle red powder into it, and similar things from corrosive medicines; and place a cooked egg-white over the eye to secure it from hot inflammation.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If some of the white of the eye remains and hot blood prevails in you and you fear a hot inflammation, then leave the eye alone and treat it with that which settles inflammation.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the treatment on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And do similarly with the flesh that happens to be in the eye from this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 However, it is necessary that a stranger should not undertake the treatment of any weak eye from natural or accidental causes by operating with iron, and you should not interfere in any of these operations until you see that this member can bear that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 ¶ On collecting Sebel (pus) from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter Eighteen
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 Pus consists of red veins that spread over the eye and hinder its vision; and with the passage of time, they weaken the eye.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye with pus is strong and has no other illness except for pus; then collect the pus from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And it is necessary that you instruct the patient to place his head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend those veins with one or two hooks according to your judgment; and let the hook be of fine wire, as shown in this figure [image not provided], or let there be two hooks on one body, as shown in this figure [image not provided].
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect those veins with fine scissors carefully, and wipe away the blood hour by hour until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they dissolve; and be careful not to injure the eye with the ends of the tweezers.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation very much: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have cleared it out, then distill into the eye either green or red: so that its sharpness may eat away what remains of the barley seed.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 But if you are not able to remove all of it at that time, then bandage the eye with something that will alleviate the pain of the eye; and leave it for some days until its pain is relieved: and protect it from a hot abscess; then repeat the same process over it according to the same method until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the shape of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 About reducing a broken nose back to its normal position.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 Doctors call the broken nose a fistula, which they treat with a cautery or with a sharp burning medicine, as was mentioned before in its description.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it unless you pierce over the abscess at its origin and draw out all the moisture and pus that is in it until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 Therefore, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument whose shape is like this. ■
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And its name is "rasp for the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Let it be made from Indian iron and let its head be round like a needle, which should be studded with the studs of a file or the studs of a fine rasp; and place it on the corrupted bone. ■ ■ ■
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it between your fingers and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is scraped off; and do this several times. ■ ■ ■
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with dry astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If therefore the place consolidates and flesh grows in it, and the course of pus ceases: and it remains for forty days without renewing or becoming inflamed, and no accident occurs in it: then know that it has already been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no wisdom in it, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is that you uncover from the bone with a second iron or with a sharp medicine: and when the opening has been uncovered, then take a trepan of this form, its end being iron and triangular: and its handle be a slender pyramid up to the extremity, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it over the very opening: and let it be near the tear duct: and extend your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the trepan until it penetrates the opening, and let the patient feel it: because he finds air escaping from it when his hand is placed over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore then restore the place with astringent and drying medicines, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 Therefore when flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter that was flowing out to the outside returns to the nose: it is therefore easier for the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 ¶ About the Reduction of an Eye's Prominence.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When an eye protrudes with all of itself and no harm or decrease occurs to the sight, then it is necessary that you release the patient; then phlebotomize him: afterwards place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then place over the eye a plaster made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then bind the eye above with many fine threads on top of the plaster.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 "And the way to make poultices is this: take soft cloths, many of them, and fold each one into four layers. Make many of these. Then place one on top of another according to the amount needed for the eye. Then bind them together with a hard cloth, tightly.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 "And repeat the procedure with cupping glasses, using suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 "Then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 "However, if the ligature becomes loose again, then it must be tied tightly. Then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 "If you see that the eye has already returned to its normal state, then it is good. If not, then repeat the treatment with plasters, poultices, bandages, and cupping glasses until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 "Chapter on Incising the Conjunctiva.
Caput XXI.	 "Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 "When a rupture occurs in the conjunctiva and a lump protrudes from the eyelid like a grain of barley, disfiguring the face, and one wishes to incise it, then the procedure is as follows: insert the needle at the root of the eyelash from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 "Then insert another needle with double thread from the lacrimal part and make it penetrate; then leave the first needle in its original position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 "Then cut the place of the double thread and tie with it the part of the eyelid around the needle; and bind it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 "Then remove the needle and place a cotton pad soaked in egg white over the eye; and leave it until the thread falls out with the eyelid.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 "Then care for the eye with what strengthens it until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 "And sometimes the eyelid is bound all around with a ring of cloth until the eye protrudes greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be pierced with a fine needle that reaches to the depth of the eye, and let the moisture of the white run out, and let the eye sink down, and immediately enter; then bind it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 About the treatment of alcomnatum.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This illness, which is called alcomnatum, is nothing but a discharge that accumulates in the eye, similar to water descending, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the way to treat this is by having the patient sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take his head with your hands on both sides and move it until you see the discharge reach below his eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it should be fixed and not move downward, and the eye should be released; and the patient should see things as he used to see them; and if it does not move downward, you should know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 But if the descent of the discharge does not occur as we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands. ️
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a fine needle and slightly puncture the skin where the conjunctiva joins with the cornea, near the edge, until the discharge comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When it comes out, then drip warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey; or water that has already been boiled with fenugreek and honey. Then treat it with the rest of the remedy until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 § On the treatment of water descending into the eye, or cataracts.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 Now we have spoken about the types of water according to its division, and which is appropriate for piercing, as the declarative and explanatory speech has stated; then take that same [water] according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary for you to have the patient sit between your hands, facing the light, near the sun; and cover his healthy eye, and bind it very tightly; then with your right hand, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one. ️
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take with your right hand the collyrium, if the eye is left: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the tip of the collyrium near the cornea according to the thickness of the radius, in the same whiteness of the eye where the tear duct is smaller; then press the collyrium with force: and you turn your hand with it until it penetrates into the sclera of the eye: and feel that the collyrium has already reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the collyrium be to the depth, the measure of the space which is from the pupil until the end of the blackness; and this is the cornea of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 For you will see them in the very pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place the collyrium until it reaches the watery part.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it downwards once after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If therefore the water immediately comes out, then the patient sees that immediately on which he opens his vision, and the collyrium is in his eye.  ()
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then wait a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If water comes out, then put it aside a second time, except that the collyrium emerges.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it becomes fixed and does not come out, then remove the collyrium with ease: and you slowly turn your hand.  ()  ()
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve some of the clear salt crystal in water: and wash the eye with it from within.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place outside the eye all cotton or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white: and bandage the sound eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 But we, and those who are of our time, place on top of it ground barley with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the collyrium does not obey you at the entrance into the eye because of its hardness, since it is made from humans whose eyes are very hard: then it is necessary that you take a small stick, which is called Albard, and this is what it looks like.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 So grasp that same membrane with it, and do not thrust your hand through the opening; there is nothing to do but to make a way to the almagda, a subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then introduce the almagda as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a decently made bedchamber in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room; and let him be kept from all movement and coughing; and give him food by which his nature is soothed; and let him not move his head at all to the right or the left.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then unbind it in that dark room, and test his vision; and make him look at things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then rebinding it until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not right to do this at the time of the operation or immediately after the incision; but rather it should be avoided, because water rises quickly through a powerful gaze.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 But if a hot swelling occurs, then it is necessary to unbind the eye before the seventh day; and treat it with what soothes the swelling until it subsides; then let out its vision, and place on his face a coverlet that regulates his sight under it for several days, while he remains in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then let him go forth from the house gradually, and turn to his affairs.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that a student is not exempted from vision many times; then indeed he may venture upon the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed a certain man from those of Alarcos has come to us, who said that at Alarcos an almagda was pierced through which water is sucked out.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new. 》
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are the forms of species from dough, so that it may stand on it who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Let them be made properly from air: and their extremities should have this same triangular subtlety, and an acute tip.
Formae magda.	 Forms of dough.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 ¶ On the care for flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter Twenty-Four.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Sometimes in the nose, various kinds of flesh are born, one of which resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from this is cancerous flesh, stone-like, dark in color; and from it is gentle flesh, not dark in color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, in that which is gentle from these fleshes, not deceitful nor cancerous, it is necessary for you to make the patient sit between your hands opposite the ground, and open their nostrils, and throw a hook into those fleshes; then draw them outwards, and cut what you have grasped from them with a thin sharp spatula on one side until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 But if something of it remains whose cutting is not possible; then scrape that with one of the fine instruments easily, until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 But if blood prevails over you, or a hot aposteme occurs; then oppose it with what is necessary: or it is from malignant apostemes, then hurry to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the fleshes are removed.  /> But if the patient's nose bleeds frequently and persistently, or there is a severe headache, or fever, or other harmful symptoms appear; then it is necessary for you to stop these, before treating this disease.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then after the incision, vinegar should be poured into the nose, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 But if the nose is opened, and moisture comes out of it as far as the palate, then know that he is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that inside there is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then you should insert a linen thread with some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot the length of a finger or less. The patient will then make one end of the thread enter the nose with a bone, or whatever is possible for him to make similar to an awl: and he should pull on his olfactory until it reaches the skull, and exits over his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And often boys at school do something similar to this Atom; and it is an easy thing for one who wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that exits from the nose and the other that remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then the flesh is cut with a saw along with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the flesh is now together with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then remove the thread and place a linen cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment into the nose after washing away the blood. Do this for three days or more until the remaining ointment has completely eaten away the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then at the end of the treatment, place a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If, however, it needs drying treatment, use this one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For making a head-purge, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make this from silver or bronze, similar to a small lamp, open like a shell, and its channel similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you want to make it as a closed tube, make it like a reed.  />
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the shell of the instrument for making a head-purge should be full and open; it should have a handle at its end with which you hold it when heating oil or whatever liquid substances you wish in it.  />  />  />
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 About caring for a broken nose.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 A swelling often occurs at the tip of the nose and increases over time, until it becomes unsightly.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And because of this, it is necessary that at its first appearance you cut into it and completely remove the whole thing.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on the spot either a hot iron or a burning medicine to take its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If therefore its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider whether it is stony, hard, dark in color, and painful; do not touch it with iron because it is a malignant tumor.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 For many times I have seen that whoever cuts into such a tumor has suffered great harm from it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the tumor is soft to touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be cut into entirely, then evacuate the patient and cut into it without fear or dread; and treat the spot with that which dries and contracts until it heals. 😊
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 About stitching the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, an operation on it is of little benefit, except in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when this happens to someone, you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood; then bring together the edges of the wound with stitches and treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the lips of separation have already separated and each part has become healthy; then it is necessary to scrape off all parts that are visible from their skin until they bleed. 😊
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then bring the two lips together with stitches and tie them; and sprinkle on them powdered blood of a dragon and ground frankincense; and place on these powders a piece of diafinicon plaster and another of the consolidating plasters; and leave it tied for two or three days. 😊 ️
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it and replace the medicine; and let it go until the threads are cut off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards, take care of him with ointment until he is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is to join the continuity with a needle, as we have described in the case of the abdomen, or to join it with thread, as I have taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 ¶ On the Extraction of Lip Nodes.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Indeed, many people develop hard lumps inside their lips, similar to grains of barley, and some are smaller while others are larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, you should turn the lip inside out and flatten over each node; then hang it with a hook and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after cutting with powdered barley until the blood is cut off.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then wash it with vinegar and scrape the place where the astringency is until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 ¶ On the Incision of Flesh Above the Gum. ➤
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often there appears on the gum a growth of flesh which the ancients called abulus.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore, you should hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, allowing the pus or blood to run out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place on the site powdered barley or other astringent and drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If the flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut it a second time and cauterize it, for it will not return after cautery.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 ¶ On the Filing of Teeth with Iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 Sometimes there form on the surfaces of teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums, rough, foul growths which blacken and turn yellow and green until corruption reaches the gum, making the teeth foul.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and his head on your lap, and shave the tooth and its pulp, in which you see cortices and something similar to sand: until nothing remains of them, and do likewise with the blackness, the greenness, and the yellowness, and other things until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 Therefore, if what is in them is removed at the beginning of the reasoning process, that is good; and if not, then you must repeat the reasoning process over them on another day, a second time, and a third time, until finally your effort achieves what you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth requires razors of diverse forms and many shapes according to how it is prepared for your operation; therefore, because the razor with which the tooth is shaved from below is different from the razor with which the space between the teeth is shaved, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these shapes of the razors should be prepared for you, as you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 On the Extraction of Toothache
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary to treat the tooth for its pain with all skill and be slow in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For it is not a matter of replacing its place when extracted: because it is a sublime substance. But when there is no excuse for extracting it, then if the patient is forced to have the tooth extracted, you must firmly secure and establish with yourself the aching tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 For often the pain deceives the patient and makes him think that it is in the tooth and he extracts it; then the pain does not go away until a weaker tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 For we have already seen this in the practice of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is firmly established with you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, on which there is some power, until the gum is dissolved from every side; then move the tooth gently with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and hold the patient's head between your knees so that you have held it well enough that it does not move; then draw the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it beneath it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you must fill that hole with cloth; and tie it with a fine string, so that it does not break at the time of your squeezing on top of it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And you must act very carefully with scarification all around the gums from every side greatly.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And be strong so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the patient with greater evil than his first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And beware of doing what ignorant bleeders do out of haste and their own boldness in removing it, besides administering that which we have narrated.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For many times they cause great diseases to befall men, which are very difficult to break and all or some of its roots remain; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have often witnessed this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then let it be rinsed after its extraction with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If bleeding occurs from the site (for this often happens), then take some of zegi and fill the site with it; and if not, cauterize it if zegi does not benefit you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The tips of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should be long, and have a short, thick handle so that they do not bend when pressed on the tooth with them; they should be like you see with thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not give way to themselves or bend; they should have short tips, and be made of Indian iron or well-made steel, straight at the tips; and in their tips there should be teeth, some fitting into others, and binding with a decent, strong constriction.  />
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes they become like the beak of a bird called a stork, and are very narrow.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 About the extraction of teeth, and the removal of broken jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When something remains after the extraction of a broken tooth, then you should place a cotton pad with butter on it for one day or two days until the area softens; then introduce to it tweezers or forceps whose tips resemble the beak of a bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 This is the form of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 Let their tips be made like a file within, or like a chisel.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not yield to you with these forceps, then you should make an incision on the root and expose all the flesh; then introduce a small lever whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 Let it be short of tip, somewhat thick; and let it not be brittle, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root comes out with it, that is good; and if not, you must help with these other instruments whose forms are these. ¶ Adhuc alii instrumenti faciuntur de ligno, et non franguntur.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The form of the first is triangular at the tip, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The form is a thin triangular tip.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also help with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with the other instruments and tools that have been mentioned earlier regarding teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also help with this instrument that resembles a large hook of this form, having a twisted triangular tip with some thickness so it does not break; and let it be not brittle.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that the instruments of teeth are many; and likewise the other instruments are not counted, and an expert craftsman, subtle in his art, finds by himself an instrument according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves indicate.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because of the variety of kinds of diseases about which the ancients did not speak of instruments.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If, however, the bone is broken from the jaw or other bones of the mouth, or if it becomes rotten; then explore over it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned for root extraction, and help with this hook, whose shape is this:
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let there be in it something thick gradually, so that the bone may be held or grasped with it, and not slip away, until the bone comes out; and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 But if there is only a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape it from its rottenness, and care for it, until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 About the binding of protruding teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, the form becomes ugly through that; and especially when this happens to women and girls, namely whores.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not placed, or its binding or filing is possible; then extract it. And if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this:
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It is similar to a small beak and is made from Indian iron, with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your cut, by which you cut it, be over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that another tooth may not be disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 But if it is protruding and ready for filing; then file it with an Indian file, whose form is this: ›
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 It should be all of Indian iron, and its handle of very small points, as the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth may not be disturbed or fall out; then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a tooth, from which a piece breaks off and injures the tongue, then it must be filed evenly until the roughness of that break is removed, leveled, and smoothed so that it no longer injures the tongue or corrupts speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 Concerning the extraction of teeth using golden threads.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When a concussion or injury occurs to the front teeth from a blow or accident, and the patient cannot bite down on what they are eating so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not been effective, then there is a method for securing them using a golden thread. Because silver turns green and rots after several days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And the thread should be of medium thinness and thickness according to the size between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 And the manner of this extraction is as follows: take a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then weave it with both ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or several, until you reach with the weaving to the other healthy tooth on the opposite side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then repeat the weaving back to where you started; and bind with finesse and wisdom until it does not move at all; and let your binding of the thread be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors; and join them together and turn them back with a probe; and hide them between a healthy tooth and a loose tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it remain thus bound until it heals.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 But if it loosens or breaks, bind them again with another thread, and they will remain secure in this manner for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the extraction of two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two return to their original places after the accident, and are retained as we have described, and remain there; and this is done only by an skilled craftsman, wise and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a bone from an ox is prepared; and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in its position, by which the tooth is supported and fastened, as we have said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Concerning the cutting of the ligament that occurs beneath the tongue, which prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 Sometimes this ligament that occurs beneath the tongue is natural, present from birth, or it may be acquired, resulting from an old healed wound.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 And the procedure is to open the patient's mouth wide and lift up their tongue; then cut through that nerve-like ligament across its width until the tongue is freed from its constriction.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 But if there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is due to an old healed wound, then insert a hook into it and cut through its width until you reach the ligament and free the knot. ›
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And be careful not to create a deep cut in the flesh, lest you cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then wash the site of the incision with rose water or vinegar or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a linen cloth under the tongue for the patient to hold every night, so that it does not heal again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 But if bleeding occurs, then apply powdered alum to the site.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if the bleeding is too much for you to manage, then cauterize the site with a suitable cautery iron; then treat it with the usual care until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Of the extraction of a salivary gland that forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the procedure is to open the mouth of the patient in sunlight and examine the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see that it is dark or black in color, hard, and the patient cannot feel it, then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.  
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is inclined towards whiteness and has moisture, then place a hook into it, and cut it with a thin scalpel, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If blood overcomes you during your procedure, then place crushed zea on it until the bleeding stops; then return to your procedure until you extract it with all of its contents.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and care for it with the remaining appropriate treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 ¶ Of the treatment of an abscess in both tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Sometimes abscesses occur between the throat and the glands, which are similar to glands that appear externally; they are called tonsils. If you treat them with what we have said about incision and they do not heal, then consider them.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If the abscess is hard, dark in color, and has little sensation, then do not touch it with an iron instrument.   
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is red in color and its base is thick, then do not touch it even with an iron instrument, fearing a flow of blood; rather, leave it until it matures.      
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 And then either you will pierce it or it will burst on its own.      
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is of white color and round, and its root is fine: then it should be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation on it is this, that you should consider before its operation, if the aposteme becomes quiet after a complete quietude, or is diminished by some diminution: then indeed make the sick person sit before the sun, and his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let the servant receive between his hands, and press down his tongue below with an instrument, of which this is the shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or bronze, which should be as fine as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 So when you press with it the tongue and the aposteme is shown to you, and your sight falls on it: then take a hook, and insert it into the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you should also pull some of its tunics with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with an instrument, the shape of which is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It resembles scissors; however its extremities should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly against the other's edge. Therefore ensure that it is made of iron of Indus, or steel tempered by immersion in vinegar.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a scalpel, the shape of which is as follows.  /> It resembles a knife, however its extremity should be sharpened on both sides.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 Let it be sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same form of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then after the incision, let the sick person rinse with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 But if bleeding occurs, let him rinse with water in which the bark of oak apples or myrtle leaves and similar astringents have been boiled, until the flow of blood is stopped; then treat him until he is cured.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes there arise on the throat other abscesses besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Therefore, cut those according to what I said about cutting the two tonsils evenly.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 And indeed I myself have already treated a woman for an abscess that had arisen in her throat, which was drawing toward blackening, scarcely any sensation remained, and it had nearly closed the throat: and the woman was breathing with difficulty, and it had already prevented her from eating food and drinking water; and she had almost reached death if she had remained for one day or two.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent forth two branches, until they came out through both nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 Therefore I hastened and inserted a hook into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it, and with it was drawn out a large piece.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut off the piece where it had been caught at the nostril opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did the same to what came out of the other nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened her mouth and pressed down on her tongue; and then I inserted a hook into the abscess itself; then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood flowed out. Therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not stop cutting from that abscess many times over a long period; and the abscess would come forth in place of what I had cut, until it was stretched out too much along with her.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 Therefore, I incised and cauterized the abscess in the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 It stopped from growing; then I left her side, and I do not know what God did with her after that.  /> 120.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 ¶ About the incision of an abscess on the lip.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 37
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When the catarrh descends to the mouth and forms a swelling that is long, it is called "perpendicular." And if it is thick and round at the bottom, it is called an "uvula.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is treated with what we have said regarding division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot swelling has quieted from it, and it is subtle, then you should cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And if from it a round swelling has formed, which does not have length, and is red or dark-colored or black, and does not have sensation, then you should avoid cutting into it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For in this there is danger for the patient.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore, when you see it according to the manner that I have said concerning its whiteness and length, make the patient sit before the sun; then press his tongue with the instrument whose description has preceded. Afterwards, insert a hook into the uvula and draw it down; then cut it with one of the two instruments which I have mentioned for the incision of the two tonsils. ︎
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And you should not cut from it except that which is added beyond the natural limit without additional growth.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut more than this, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 After the incision, use what we have described for the incision of the two tonsils; and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 But if the patient is frightened by the incision, then you should use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear or dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 And the method of cautery for it is not except with sharp water, and this is that you place the patient's head on your lap. ︎ ︎ ︎
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument which I have mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take from the water which I have mentioned to you in the chapter on cautery and make a cup not yet extinguished with it, and place it not too thick nor too thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, whose form is thus.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let there be a depression at its end where the medicine is placed, like the hollow of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 And put the instrument with the medicine on the wound itself: and let the sick person lie on their side, so that the saliva runs out of their mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing from it descends into the throat and harms them.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you should do this on the wound for half an hour until you see it become blackened and the bite of the medicine has calmed down.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to use a bandage, wrap it around the end of the spoon and pour the medicine over the bandage, then insert the spoon with the bandage into the wound until the bandage sticks to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this many times until you achieve what you want from the cautery of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then leave it; for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to renew the medicine, renew it; and after cauterization, clean around the wound with a bandage soaked in butter, and cleanse it with what remains of the medicine around it; and then rinse with cold water.  />
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And let it be scraped externally with ointments, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Therefore, this method of treatment is more wholesome than cutting and further from danger.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the wound is also cured with something finer than cautery and cutting; for it is cured with fumigation, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calament, hyssop, oregano, rue, saffron, chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs; and gather all of them or some of them in a pot and let them be soaked with vinegar and boiled; and the pot should be well daubed with clay; and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which should be placed a concave instrument in this way.  />  />  />
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Let it be made of silver or copper, and its tip, where the seed is, should be inserted into the mouth of the patient until the vapor rises to the top over the tube, until the mouth becomes very dark.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat this many times on the same spot until it dries out.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess formation.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 For it often increases the swelling, and you should not do this unless the abscess is cooled down.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and put the shell of an egg on its tip so that the patient's mouth does not burn, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 ¶ On extracting thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often a bone or a fishbone gets stuck in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, you should extract whatever is visible from the throat after pressing the tongue with an instrument against the sun, and it will be revealed to you what is inside the throat. ➤
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And whatever does not appear and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food settles in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 For perhaps the object will come out with the vomit.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or the patient should swallow a piece of nap, or a lettuce root, or a dry biscuit; or he should take a small piece of soft sponge, tie it on a string, and then swallow it. ➤
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When it reaches the place where the bone or thorn is, it will be pulled out, and then it will come out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use an instrument made of lead in this manner. ➤ ➤
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 It should be somewhat thicker than the radius and have a curve at its tip, which it can easily insert into its throat; and it should have its head raised upward.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let it be careful not to touch its epiglottis, lest coughing occur; and let it expel with it bone, or spine, or let the physician insert his hand into it.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But what the patient introduces is better; on account of his knowledge of the place where the thing is attached. And let it push downwards or draw its hand with the instrument upwards, all that according to the quantity prepared for it, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 ¶ On the Extraction of a Leech.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When a leech is treated with what was said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not work, then observe in the patient's throat before or after the sun, after you have pressed its tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook or with delicate tweezers appropriately.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them, then take a hollow reed and insert it into the patient's throat until almost to the throat; then insert into the hollow of the reed a heated iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this many times, and let the patient abstain from water all day long.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take a glass full of cold water and open his mouth into it; and rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and move the water with his hand one hour after another.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For the leech, as soon as it feels the water, will fall out.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 But if it does not come out with what we have said, then fumigate the patient with fleas or with a pan using the instrument that I told you about for fumigating the neck.  ·
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 "For this happens often, because it falls off.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 "And the manner of operation in fumigation is this: take a pot with living coals and fire; and let the pot be covered with a lid, on which there should be a hole in the middle; and place the end of the instrument into that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 "Then throw the fumigation onto it, and let the patient place his mouth on the end of the tube and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 "For the leech will immediately fall off.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 "If it does not fall off, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 "And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty foods, garlic, and do not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 "It is therefore necessary that it should come out with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 "And this is the shape of the instrument with which the leech is drawn from the throat when it falls upon it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 "It is similar to tongs, as you see; except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 "And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, which has the roughness of a file; and when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 "Chapter on the opening of abscesses, their incision, and general care.
Caput XL.	 "Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 "There are many kinds of abscesses, in many forms, as their remembrance comes to mind, that is, one and one in this book; and they differ in their opening and incision in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 "One of them is due to the nature of the abscess itself, and because it contains moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 "And the second way is due to the places where it occurs in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Because an aposteme occurring in the head is different from an aposteme occurring in the anus; and an aposteme occurring in a fleshy place is different from an aposteme occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment based on its location.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And of the apostemes, there are some that should not be pierced unless after the maturation of the pus in them and its completion; and among these are those that should be pierced while they are still fresh and do not mature according to their time.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 Just as are the apostemes that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Because when an aposteme occurs near a joint and its duration extends until it putrefies, the pus around it may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint; therefore, it is a cause of closer contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or the aposteme is on a principal member; for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either the member or through that principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus; therefore pierce it while it is immature: and you should not pierce a fresh aposteme that has not completed its digestion, except one that is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the inner parts of the anus, and become a fistula, or end up with something that does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 You should know the time of perforating a matured aposteme according to its completion: and it is at the relief of pain, the subsiding of fever, and the reduction of redness and pulsation, and the sharpness of the head of the aposteme; and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And you should make the perforation in the lower part of the aposteme and its more prominent swelling; and let the perforation be along the length of the body if the apostemes are in the parts of the hands and feet, and the places of the arms, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those that are reflected upon, go with a hole through that membrane.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better to leave its perforation until its ripening is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 For if you perforate it before that time, the course of the pus will be prolonged from it, and there will be much filth and stench, and perhaps its edges will harden, as well as its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body, as needed; or according to what the part needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And you should administer a small perforation in small abscesses and a large perforation in large abscesses; or many incisions similar to the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And among the abscesses, there are some where it is necessary to cup the skin and cut it when it has become like a cloth, and its end has reached that which is already dead; as happens with many abscesses, such as with buboes and carbuncles.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And among them are those which are cut by a three-cornered incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And one of these is the incision in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an abscess of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And among them are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered; and similar ones from the other incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 However, in an abscess that does not have a head, such as are the mild and superficial abscesses, it is necessary to perforate it with a superficial or flat perforation only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And when the abscess is thick and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, do not hasten to draw out all the pus at that time; rather, draw out some of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then fill the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then extract some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this many times according to the degree, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old person who has reached decrepitude, for the vital spirit of the living being is often released with the discharge of pus, and perhaps the patient dies and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your perforation, through which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound and be mindful.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 Therefore, if the abscess wound is small or flat-cut, then apply a linen cloth or an old cotton cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if the abscess is large and there are many openings from the perforation, then it is necessary to insert a cloth into each opening until they meet.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if you cut off a part of the skin from the abscess or hollowed it out in its circumference, then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton or as when weaving a cloth or shaving linen hair dry and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then throw it away and treat it with what is necessary from an ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 However, if bleeding occurs during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar after the cloth has been soaked in them; and place it on the site of the bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 However, if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to apply a diet, treatment, and powders which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and from the division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 However, if it is during the winter and the site of the abscess has many nerves, then it is necessary to pour warm wine and oil over the spots and place them on the sites.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is summer, and the places are fleshy, then you should put small cloths soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 When it is the third day, as we have said, then you should release the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer to its treatment whatever is suitable for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This, therefore, is what is necessary for the universal knowledge of treating abscesses.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the second half of the division, I have already spoken about every abscess, how it is the way to its treatment individually by chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Small abscesses occur on the skin of the head, and they are of the kind called nodules, which are enclosed by membranes that are their sheaths: as if they were little pouches of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And there are many kinds of these.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Some of them are fatty; and some contain a moisture like mud; and some contain a moisture like kneaded bread or porridge; and others similar to these, and there are those which are hard as stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in the incision of all of them, and their removal, there is no fear, provided that at their incision the artery does not cause a counteraction. ¶
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation in their incision is to examine them with an instrument, the form of which will come later, which is called a probe, until you know what they contain.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a longitudinal incision with a superficial incision in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin the incision from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is emptied, then strip off the membrane that contains this moisture, and leave nothing of it behind. ¶
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 "For it often returns if something remains of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 "Then dip the cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available; and if not, in water with salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 "For this will eat away what remains of the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 "Then repeat the Egyptian ointment on the same cotton a second and third time, and if you need it, continue doing so until you are confident that nothing remains of the abscess; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 "If the abscess contains a fatty nodule, then cut it according to this form, with an incision in the shape of a cross; and place the hooks between the edges of the incision, and strip it from all sides; and strive with your skill to extract the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 "But if a vein opposes you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 "And similarly do this for an abscess if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 "And the incision on a stony abscess is easier because it contains little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 "And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses that occur in the head of some men, with which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 "This is because I cut into an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess to be like a solid and hard, rough, white stone that could not be broken; and if anyone hit it with something thrown at it, it would hurt them.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 "In other abscesses that occur in the head, besides these, namely the abscesses that occur in children's heads and at the roots of the ears, let the incision on all of them be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 "However, place the perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of blood is relieved towards the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then take care of it with what suits them in treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 § On the incision of swellings in the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These swellings often occur in the neck and under the armpits and groins; and sometimes they occur elsewhere on the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And among those that occur in the neck are one and many; and they arise from each other; and every swelling from them is within its own proper tunic, as it is with the nodes and swellings of the head, as we have mentioned.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 And there are many kinds of these swellings.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For some of them are stony; and some contain fluids; and some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 Therefore, when you see one that has a good arrangement and feels good to the touch, whose color is close to that of the skin and moves in every direction, and which is not attached to the nerves of the neck or jugular vein or artery, and it is not deep: you should cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part of the body to the lower part along the line b to the line g, and excoriate it from all sides. And spread the two lips of skin with hooks, or with many hooks if you need them, as we have said regarding the swellings of the head, and gradually remove it.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is important to take care that no vein or nerve be cut.  />
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 And let the knife not be very sharp; so that it does not give you trouble with the cut or disturb the patient, and so that you do not cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 But if you cut a vein or artery and it hinders you from operating, then place ground zegi or certain powders that dry up blood in the wound, and bind the wound, and leave it alone until the swelling of the aposteme calms down and the wound softens; or it begins to want to become putrid.  />  />  />
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 "For blood is cut off by the skin, so return to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 "Then, with your index finger, check if any other small strophuli remain; cut them out and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 "But if the strophulus has a large vein at its root, you should not cut it off from its root; rather, you should tie it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 "Then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 "Then tend to him.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 "If the entire strophulus is cut off, then you should bring together the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately after ensuring that there is no remaining excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 "But if you see that there is remaining excess due to the size of the strophulus, then it is necessary for you to intend to cut its root and extract it; and apply the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 "And for those strophuli that contain humors, pierce it with a superficial puncture so that you may know the place of its maturation; and make the puncture from what follows below in the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 "Then apply a poultice with ointment and similar substances after the puncture to corrode what remains of the corruption until you see that the wound is clean; then tend to it with regenerative flesh ointment until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 "About the incision of the epiglottis due to a swelling occurring in the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 "The ancients spoke of this incision on the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is their written account.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 In those having synanche, it is necessary to avoid cutting the epiglottis, as it does no good; because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the esophagus, it is necessary to use cutting of the epiglottis to avoid death from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small section by width, in what is between two circles, such that the section is in cartilage, not in bone: and this place is suitable for cutting because it is free from flesh, and blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the doctor is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then let him incise the skin until he reaches the esophagus; avoid blood vessels if he sees any.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then let him cut the cartilage as we have described; and it is indicated by the phlegm that comes out from there, along with its rupture, and the loss of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When the hour comes that you fear suffocation, bring together the two lips of the skin wound and close it alone without including the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Said Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The summary of this discourse that we have described is not except when they see that any one of these abscesses has blocked the throat of the sick person: and the sick person has been raised up to death, and his breath wishes to be cut: they go to cutting the epiglottis so that the sick person may breathe over the wound with some breath, and he may be saved from death. And because of this, they have ordered to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days or thereabouts; then therefore they order to suture the wound and treat it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And that which I saw with my own eyes is this: a maidservant took a knife and sent it into her throat, and cut off a part of the lung's canal with it.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning as if she were dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 Therefore, I exposed the wound, and I found blood that had come out of it to be small.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 So I became certain that she had not cut a vein or an artery: and air was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I hastened therefore, and closed the wound, and cared for it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maidservant except for a hoarseness in her voice; and after some days she returned to better health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore, I say that in cutting the epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 On Cutting a Throat Hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This tumor called a throat hernia is a large tumor, according to the color of the body, and it occurs very often in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 And it exists in two ways: for either it is natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 Certainly, the natural one has no intellect.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The accidental one, however, exists in two ways: of which one is similar to fatty knots. ‌
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other way is similar to a tumor that occurs from the knotting of an artery. ‌ ‌
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is danger with it, and one should not presume to approach it with a knife unless it is small; and you should test it and examine it with an intromitter.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it to be like a fatty knot and it is not attached to any veins, then cut it as nodules are cut; and remove it with whatever it contains of pus, if there is any pus; and if there is not, then explore all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with what is necessary for healing until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 About the incision above the knuckles.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many kinds of knuckles, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division. And it is necessary for me to explain here the difference between a knuckle and a protrusion, since there is some confusion about this.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 I say therefore that when a protrusion occurs, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the boiling over of the excess matter ceases and the process of decay is completed; then the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 But with a knuckle there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and they are contained by the sac called sifachin, which is their own pouch, and it matches the color of the body. And their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a fig, larger or smaller. 》
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are in two types: either fleshy, or they contain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 The colors of the moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a knuckle, it is necessary to examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called "intromissum", as its form will be shown in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 And the way to investigate all knuckles and tumors is as follows: take this instrument and insert it into the moistest part of the tumor that you find; and then slowly turn your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then place your hand according to the size of the tumor. 》 》
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then withdraw the intromissum and observe what comes out in its path.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If therefore liquid oozes out, whatever its color may be, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said for other tumors.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if moisture does not exit after insertion, know that it is fatty; therefore, make a cut above it in the shape of a cross as I have taught you: suspend it with hooks and easily remove the skin from every part: and keep kistin over it, if possible, to extract it safely with a knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If the kist (i.e., abscess or swelling) bursts during the operation and it is not possible to extract it safely, for often this happens; then remove it in pieces until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if some small or large part remains, the knot (i.e., the abscess) will return again according to the most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if it overcomes you and some part remains; then fill the wound at its completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and tie up the wound, and place a warm poultice on top of it; and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 Therefore, if it is a large knot (i.e., abscess), then either its two lips or care for it with that which cures flesh.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 But if a contrarily pulsating or non-pulsating vein is present to you; then hasten and fill the place with crushed henbane seed, and leave it tightly bound for two days or three until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood calms down: then return to cut that which remains from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 ¶ Concerning external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 OF THESE are the forms of the probes, and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 From these is a large one, from these is a medium one, and from these is a small one.  />
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 They should be made of square-ended steel, fittingly, so that they hasten entry into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are the forms of Experiences, and yes, that is, piercing: and one of them is called beris, which means, piercing: and there are three kinds of it.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 Of these, indeed, there is the large, and the medium, and the small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They are suitable for investigating apostemas, exiturae, fistulas, and buboes due to what is between the bones among them.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others are made round, smooth, and blunt, like the large needles with which cushions are stuffed, from citrinum, or bronze, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 And the best of them are those made from citrinum.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And experiences are also made from black lead, which are suitable for investigating fistulas, whose cavity is a reflection, so that they may be reflected with their gentleness and those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And there are again three kinds of them.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because from these [types] there are the long ones, and the medium ones, and the short ones, according to the width of the fistula and its narrowing.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The form of knives, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because from these [knives] there are the simple ones, that is, with one curvature; and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And from these [knives] there are blind knives; and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And from these [knives] are hooks with two curvatures, and they are of three kinds; and from these are hooks with three curvatures, and they are of three kinds; and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and apostemas are cut and scraped; and they are of three kinds, because from these there is the large one, the medium one, and the small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 Their tips, which are used for cutting, are sharp; the tips of others are not sharp: and they are not placed this way except to bring benefit during the scraping of nodes due to fear of incising a vein or nerve; and so that through them the patient may heal and find temporary relief from the burning sensation found in the scraping of an aposteme.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are Magda, and there are three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of bronze and resemble a ray; with it, one makes alcohol. At the tip, there is a hidden spatula-like point, and it runs to the inside or outside when desired, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The shape of the spatulas that are hidden among the fingers during the perforation of apostemes; and patients do not notice them; and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The shapes of the ventoses with which the flow of blood is cut off; and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 They are made of bronze or brass, round and somewhat long, as you see; and they should be thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And it is necessary that you have these two kinds of ventoses, large and small, so that you can quickly cut off blood when needed, especially when the medicine is not present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 Nevertheless, you should not use them to cut off blood in every part of the body, and you should only use them in fleshy areas such as the thighs of the legs, hips, arms of the shoulders, breasts, belly, groin, and similar fleshy, moist places.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they are made into other small instruments resembling chestnuts according to their shape; with them blood is cut off when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or during the incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 On the care of the nipples in humans which resemble the nipples of women.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the nipples of certain individuals swell at the end of sleep (that is, when they begin to ejaculate during sleep) until they resemble the nipples of women, and they remain disgustingly prominent.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Therefore, if one is repulsed by this, it is necessary to make an incision above the nipples in the shape of a lunula, according to the following form from line b to line g. Then, remove all the fatty tissue.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Then fill the wound with the flesh-forming medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then join the two lips of the wound with a stitch and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the nipple inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to make two incisions on each of its superior sides in the shape of a lunula, each meeting at the ends of both, so that one line contains the other, according to this form from line b to line g. Then, remove the skin between the two lips and take away the fatty tissue. And administer what we said about stitching and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If you do not complete the incision as required due to the discomfort of the patient or excessive bleeding, then it is necessary to fill the wound with cotton soaked in a caustic ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fatty tissue.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 ¶ On the perforation of an abscess that occurs under a ticklish spot.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscesses that occur under ticklish spots are of the hard kind of warts, which contain a pouch, and among them are those which contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 "Therefore, those that contain humors should be cut with a lunar section, according to this form: from line b to line g. When everything in the abscess has been evacuated from pus, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the cotton and scrape with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the abscess is of the type called "nodules" or "strophulus," then cut over it as we said for strophulus, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If the wound spreads to the point of emitting pus, then apply a cautery to it, as we said previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 § On the incision of an abscess that occurs due to artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, then very often an abscess occurs from there; and similarly, this happens with veins as well, so that an abscess and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery or vein are: for when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and deeply seated in the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a grating sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And that which is due to a vein is round and situated superficially in the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And incision over this abscess is harmful, and especially if it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and many other parts of the body; and it is very dangerous.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, one must avoid treating it with a knife, and those that are also in the extremities or head must be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 So, for those that occur from the swelling of the opening of an artery, make a cut in the skin along its length. ⋅
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with hooks; afterwards the artery, and free it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then introduce a needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side; and constrict the artery with a double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two temporal arteries.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then puncture the place that is between the two ligatures with a probe until all the blood flows out of it and the abscess dissolves.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments for it until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 But if the abscess is due to a vein section, then you should hold as much of the abscess with skin as you can in your hand.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then introduce a needle under the place which you have held in your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then bind the abscess with the same ligature as you bind the grape ligature, from both sides with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 But if you fear that the thread may be drawn out, then introduce another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the place of the first needle; press and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the abscess in its middle until what is inside comes out; then cut off the excess skin and leave what has been bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place upon it a little piece of cloth which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a treatment that is made with linens and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 ¶ On the abscess which occurs from twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	 Chapter 90
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As an aposteme occurs in arteries and veins, so also does it occur in nerves; this happens to them from a blow or from excessive labor and similar things; and it is most common in the places of the joints, or the heel, and in every place where the joints move; and it is a grave aposteme.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is generally painless in most cases; but when pressed with intensity, the patient feels a sensation like numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And the aposteme is not deep within the body but rather under the skin; and it moves to all parts of the body, except that it does not go forward or backward, neither to the front nor to the back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 Therefore, when such an aposteme is found in the joints, it should not be pierced with a knife.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps then contraction may occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 However, if it is found in the head or forehead, incise the skin with a razor.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If then the aposteme is small, hold it with forceps and cut it off from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then hang it with a hook and scrape it away; afterward remove it, and close the wound with sutures; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 ¶ On the incision of an aposteme that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LXI
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 It happens to some people many times in their abdomen and other parts of their body that small lumps appear, which are called fungal, because they resemble fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Whose root is delicate and whose head is thick, and their lips are turned back.  /> ¶ De sectione thelili, quod accidit in ore.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And some of them are small; and others grow very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 And I have seen a man, and in his abdomen there were two lumps, which were more like fungi than anything else: there was no difference between them; they were white, with a small root, and their lips turned back, and they were moist, and moisture always flowed from them.  /> ¶ De sectione thelili, quod accidit in ore.  /> Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I cut them open and found that one weighed nearly 10 and 8 ounces, the other almost 6 ounces. The procedure for cutting into them is as follows: first observe if the patient is moist and has a whitish-lilac color; if so, they are humid and have delicate roots. In this case, cut the patient with a broad spatula, and have cauterizing irons ready in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 Often indeed a great deal of blood is expelled when cutting it open; if the blood overwhelms you, hasten to cauterize it then.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see that the patient is cowardly and afraid of the incision with iron, then take a neatly made lead thread and tie it around the area as we have described, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add to the tying of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Do not cease from tying the lead whenever it prints on the area, until it is cut off and falls away by itself without labor.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If, however, the area has thick roots, then there is some danger and fear in cutting it open; especially if it is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 However, it is possible to cut half of it open.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for him until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And beware of presuming to cut open a black-colored area with little sensation and foul appearance; for it is a cancerous abscess, and I will remember Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 ¶ About the care of the navel projection.
Caput LII.	 Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 A navel projection occurs for many reasons. ■
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 Or from a tear, which is on the abdomen; and from it comes out either an intestine or intestinal content, as happens with other tears.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 Or from blood that flows from a vein, or an artery, as mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or from constricted flatulence within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If it is due to a fistula and the discharge of pus: then the color of the swelling resembles that of the body, and it is soft, without pain; and its position varies.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, then its position has a greater difference, as we have described.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it increases greatly at the entrance to the bath, and causes great labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 But if it is due to moisture, it is soft; then when you press it with your hand, it does not disappear nor become constricted, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then with these signs the swelling appears dark red, as if from a cliff.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to dead flesh: then the swelling is heavy, thick, hard, and remains in one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If it is due to flatulence, however, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation in it is, that then you should consider whether the swelling of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or flatulence; then you must abstain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is danger and fear in it, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke about swellings due to an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 But if the swelling of the navel is due to the intestines or pus: then you must advise the sick person to hold his breath and stand straight.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark the signs with cautery all around the navel.  ?> Et praecipe ei, quatenus non uadat ad balneum, neque respi-scant, aut lauant uenter suum per diem.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Then instruct him to lie on his back between your hands over his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then encircle it with a wide bandage around the navel over the place you marked with cautery.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then extend the middle of the aposteme upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then tie it tightly around with thread or silk cord; and let the knot be alexostate.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open the middle of the extended aposteme above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you find that it has already been captured by the ligature, then remove the alexostate and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine back inside the abdomen; and if you find the zirbum, then take it with a hook and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 But if the contrary is an artery or vein to you, then bind it very tightly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your procedure.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them; and insert the two needles into the circle you made around the aposteme in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then draw the aposteme taut in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave it until the extended flesh becomes rotten and falls off by itself; or cut it when it softens and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with whatever is necessary from the salves until he heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 But if the protuberance of the navel is of fleshy growth or of moisture therein, then you should make the aposteme concave, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And you should draw out the blood, or moisture, that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then treat him with what solidifies the place.  •
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 § On treating CANCER.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already spoken about the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines; and we must be careful not to use iron for its treatment, lest it ulcerate; and we spoke about cancer generated in the womb and the caution necessary for its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 The ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated, such as in the breasts or thighs and similar parts of the body from which it can be removed entirely, especially if it is small and just beginning, ...
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 ... when it becomes advanced and large, one should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I have not been able to cure anyone of it; nor have I seen anyone before me who has reached that point.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you should precede and resolve the patient with black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then perform a bloodletting on him if you find him with clear signs of fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the patient with the preparation in which he will be located for the operation.  />
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then place hook-shaped instruments into the cancer that fit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow it out from all sides with the skin, according to the investigation, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, but press the places and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever is possible there among the instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If, however, the flow of thick blood from the cutting of an artery or vein causes difficulty for you, then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 ¶ On the Treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter Forty-Four.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We have already narrated in the division of the types of dropsy, how water is collected; and all the signs of every type, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And that which is treated with the iron is only the sole type of ascites; and one does not approach with iron the type of tympanites; nor the type of hypersarcus completely, for that is fatal.  /> ♥
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 "When you have been treated for this kind of hydropic tympanites with medicines, and your treatment does not take effect; then be aware.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 "For if the patient has already become weakened, or there is another infirmity besides hydropis, such as coughing, or loosening of the belly, and similar things; then beware of treating him with iron, for there is danger in that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 "But if you see the patient is of abundant strength and there is no illness with him except hydropis alone; and he is neither a child nor an elderly person; then the manner of operation on him is that you should lift the patient, standing between your hands, and the assistant behind him should press his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 "Then take a thorny probe of this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 "Let it be of two sharp ends, long, with a sharp tip like a probe.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 "However, let there be some gradual narrowing in it, so that you do not penetrate with it during the operation all the way to the intestine and injure it.
Deinde considera.	 "Then be mindful.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 "For if the hydropic growth comes from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend the incision from the navel by three finger widths, straight down to above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 "But if the cause of the hydropic growth is due to liver disease, then let your incision be on the left side of the navel by three finger widths.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 "And if the cause of it is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it should not be an incision on the side where the patient wishes to lie, so that the discharges do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 "Then pierce all the skin with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert into that incision, and lift your hand with a spatula between the skin, and scrape, as if you are removing it: and let the amount removed be the size of a nail or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce with the scalpel until the spatula reaches the empty place, and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument of this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver or bronze or brass, smooth and polished; at its lower part is a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side; and its end is cut in the manner of cutting reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately comes out above the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in one hour a medium quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Because if you evacuate more than is necessary from it in one hour, perhaps the patient will die from a weakening of his vital spirit, or a syncope which approaches death will occur to him.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 Indeed, evacuate from it according to the power of the instrument, and according to what the patient's condition indicates to you by his pulse and by its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument, and keep the water.  />
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 Which is to say, because it is immediately retained by the skin which keeps the opening that is above the scalpel; about which I have said, that you should pierce through it in this manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then repeat the process with the instrument on the next day, if you see that the patient can tolerate it; and also extract from the water a small quantity.  />  />  />  />
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Do this for several days without fear and guard against error; until there is only a little left from the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you fear for the patient and release much water from him, then care for him with a burial in warm sand, and much sweat in the bath and sun, and wait until he is thirsty; and care for him with drying medicines until he is healed; and cauterize over the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water, as I have related before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 On caring for infants born with their bladder outlets not yet perforated.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When some infants come forth from their mother's womb and the outlet of their bladder is not yet perforated, or it is narrowed, or displaced.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, one should assist immediately with its perforation upon birth using a very fine probe in this manner:
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a thin lead plug in the opening and tie it; hold it there for three or four days. ️
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When he wants to pass urine, remove it, and let him urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then replace it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which accumulates there will not permit it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 As for him whose opening is narrow, he should be treated with lead as we have said, for many days, until it becomes wider. ️ ️
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 That is to say, because in those who are born, the opening is at the tip of the penis; therefore he cannot urinate forward until he raises his penis with his hand above.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 Nor can he have intercourse for this reason: that the semen cannot reach the vagina in its proper way; and it is a very shameful condition. ️ ️ ️
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the manner of treatment for this is that the patient should be turned over onto his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the head of the rod with your left hand with great extension, and cut off the head of the rod from the place of the foreskin with a needle or a sharp spatula, like cutting a reed, or as you might scrape something, so that its middle comes out similar to the head of the rod: and so that a hole falls in the middle where it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And beware of bleeding during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore oppose it with something that stops the bleeding, and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 ¶ Concerning albathers that occur on the foreskin and head of the penis, and their corruption, blackening, and adherence.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 These albathers frequently occur on the penis, and there is a foul-looking lump of flesh.  />
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this, one is malignant, and the other is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore, you should suspend the non-malignant one with a fine hook and cut it off until you have completely cleaned it out.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment over it.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the affected area with diaphanic ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 But if the albather is malignant and foul-looking, then you should apply a hot iron after cutting it open and removing it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 But if the albather is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of it is inside the foreskin while another part is outside, then you should first remove the inner part of the albather until it heals, and only then care for the outer part. For when you care for both parts together, the foreskin will not heal properly and may even be cut off.  />
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And similar blackening and corruption also occur on the testicles and the foreskin.  /> ・
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, you should scrape off everything that has already blackened and wants to rot or has already rotted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then cover it with a mixture of honey, pounded flour of peeled grains, and sifted crushed herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 But if there is bleeding, then apply a lunar-shaped cautery in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 For a cautery is helpful for two purposes at once: to stop bleeding and when a wound starts to rot.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the tip of the rod is eaten away and destroyed within an hour, then you should insert a lead pipe into the opening of the penis so that the patient urinates onto it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 In the case of adhesion of the foreskin to the tip of the penis, this adhesion does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required for it. And sometimes the adhesion occurs due to a wound or an abscess: therefore, you should scrape it off with a blunt spatula until the bond is broken and the tip of the penis is freed from every side.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish them accurately, then you should scrape a little from the tip of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 This is because when the foreskin is thin, it may be quickly pierced due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin from the tip of the penis with a thin, damp linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water, so that they do not stick together again.  />
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then treat it with styptic wine until it heals.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 About cleaning infants and treating their errors.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a disruption of continuity, as are other wounds; however, since it is the result of our action, our will, and its use is especially for children, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation and an easier path leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws, and there is nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 Which means that I have found most craftsmen and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor, and with scissors; and they use caustics, bandaging with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And I myself have already proven all these methods and found none better than cleansing with scissors and bandaging with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often slips away.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers; therefore perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower one remains; thus it is necessary to proceed with an incision to cut the other one, causing future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with cleansing done by caustics, that is, the finger used by shoemakers, the cut of the end of the male member is not secured; because perhaps it enters into its hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 However, in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron slips out and ruins your work; and the skin of the child is short by nature, and often they are born such that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 But cleansing with scissors and bandaging with thread have shown me good results; because scissors are appropriate for the cut; therefore, the sharpness that is on top is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 When you press your hand, two sharp points are aligned, and one cut is made at the same time: and a compression similar in shape occurs, enclosing the skin of the stick from all sides, with which no mistake is made at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the proper method is to have the boy estimate, especially if he is among those who can understand a little, that you do not do anything except tie a thread around his stick: and let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then have him rejoice and be glad in every way possible for you to do so, since he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then have him stand between your hands prepared to the right height, and let him not sit; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy sees them absolutely not, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into his stick and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the stick comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then cleanse it because it has accumulated filth in it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then tie the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Afterwards, tie a little below the first bandage.  • The translation is now complete.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold with your index finger and thumb the lower bandage securely, and cut between the two bandages.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the head of the stick.  • The translation is now complete.  • Thank you for sharing this text.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better) and place powder on top; and on the powder a cloth in which an egg yolk boiled in rose water has been spread out, shaken with good fresh rose oil: and leave him like this until another day: and care for him with the remaining treatment, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the scissors for cleansing is as follows:
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 The two ends are numb, and they meet; let not a nail branch out through them. And the length of the two sharp points should be equal to the length of the two handles evenly.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 However, a fallacy occurs in cleaning because perhaps the entire inner skin or part of it slipped away at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, you must stretch it from your hour with your nail before swelling of the place, and cut it according to its equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 But if three days have passed and the part under the rod remains swollen with inflammation, then leave it until the hot boil settles, and remove it easily, and cut it according to how it is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Take care of it with what consolidates a wound from the powders that we have spoken of in the chapter on powders, and if it is cut through the skin beyond measure and extends to the upper parts, this too will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Take care of it with what we have said until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 On the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter 58
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 The retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction made by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born from these and similar things that we have mentioned among the methods of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the urine does not dissolve and you see that its retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary for him to be on his knees bent forward.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then let his feet be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 It is therefore considered with the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone toward the back: why urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 And if it does not dissolve with what we have said and the matter is severe upon the patient, then it is necessary for you to administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, whose form is this. Let it be made of silver, let it be fine, smooth, concave like the quill of a feather in fineness, long like one and a half palms: at whose head let there be a fine cannula.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the manner of the exit of urine through it is that you take a doubled thread and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut off any excess from the wool with scissors, but insert it into the cannula with force, as alzar.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then grease the syringe with oil or butter and egg white: and make the patient sit on a seat, and probe the bladder, and its rod with moist oils and olive oil and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then insert the syringe into the rod easily until it reaches the root of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then double it above from the part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then press the syringe within until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has now reached an empty place: and this is not done according to this order except because the passage through which it goes is one of twistedness.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then gradually extend the thread with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 For urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then draw it out and make the urine run through the path of urine: and repeat with the syringe, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied, and let the patient find relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 The quality of enema administration with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	 Chapter 59
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or blood freezes within it, or pus accumulates and compresses it, and it becomes necessary to instill water and medicines into it: then it should be done with an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 For it is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And in it there are three openings: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the concave place, where that which drives it is located, should be according to its quantity without adding anything until when something is drawn with it from the moisture, moisture is attracted; and when it is driven out, it expels that thing to a distance: as the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in the battles of Mars.  />
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 Therefore, when you want to project moisture into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the moisture and draw with it that which drives it upwards; for moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert its end into a tube, as we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then drive out the moisture with that which drives it; for that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of a subtle enema with which the bladder is enemaed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 It should be made of silver or gilt bronze; its tip should resemble a small alcam [a type of container] and underneath it there should be a pouch into which the string falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a ram and place in it the moisture with which you want to enema the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then bind it between two strong folds with double thread, and gently warm that moistness over a fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the end of the enema tube into a pipe, afterwards place your hand on the bladder with an appropriate amount of moisture, until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert a strong thread into those holes as they are rolled.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then roll up the circle like a sausage; after you put into it what you want from moistures, oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then bind it to the instrument; and use it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 ¶ On the Extraction of Stones.
Caput LX.	 Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have already spoken about the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and I have explained the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and one in the bladder, along with its symptoms: and I have spoken about a stone that can be removed by hand or incision; this is a stone properly formed in the bladder. And there is also a stone that becomes lodged in the urethra. I am now explaining it clearly and concisely.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most commonly occurs in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And among its signs is that urine comes out of the bladder like water in its subtlety; and in it appears white sand, and the patient grinds his penis and struggles with it, and often it hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it becomes erect, and with it the anus is open in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And the cure of boys is easy until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 And it is difficult in old men.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 But for young men it is of medium difficulty, since its cure is between that and the other: the larger the stone, the easier the cure; but if it is small, the reverse is true.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 Therefore, when we come to the cure, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema that removes all the feces from his intestines; for this itself sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone at the time of examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then let the patient be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved to a lower place, so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or sometimes leap from its high position.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his hips, so that the entire bladder may slope downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him, and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If you feel a stone in the area, then hasten immediately to make an incision over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 But if it does not fall at all under your touch, then it is necessary that you wash the index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger, if he is an adult; and insert it into his anus, and examine for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press on it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where you wish to make an incision; and order one attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and another to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand; and with his other hand to remove the skin that is under the testicles from the place of incision. 》
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert the scalpel, cutting with it, whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, toward the left side of the buttocks: and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the external part of the incision may be wide and the internal part narrow, according to the size of what is possible for the egression of the stone from it, no more.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 For perhaps the finger which is in the anus presses the stone toward the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that if the stone has angles and edges, its passage is difficult on account of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And if it is smooth, like a hazelnut, and round, its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 Therefore, to the one who has angles and edges, add into the slit.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 But if it does not come out thus, then it is necessary that you invent above it; or tie above it with a thin thread whose end is like the moon, which binds above the stone and does not escape from it; or that you insert under it a subtle instrument of curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 But if you are not able to above it, then widen the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something overcomes you from blood, cut it with a thread.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 But if the stone is more than one, then expel first the large one toward the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Afterward, expel the small one after that; and do similarly if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, it is ignorance to cut over it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because to the sick one of two things happens: either he dies, or there occurs to him a continuous dripping of urine; therefore, because the place does not heal at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 Truly, administer an expulsion of it, until it comes out; or make incisions in the fracture with scissors, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have completed the operation, then fill the wound with incense, aloe, and dragon's blood; bind it up, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose-colored oil and cold water, to quiet a hot abscess.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then place the patient on his back with his head raised, and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you unbind it, wash the area well with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with diahafincan ointment and basilicon ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 But if a hot abscess or similar corruption occurs in the wound, as if blood coagulates in the bladder and blocks the flow of urine, and this is known by the excretion of blood with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Therefore insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply every remedy appropriate to the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And throughout all the hours of the entire treatment, you should bind two bandages and make them tight, because of the medicines that are placed on the area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and lodged in the flesh of the penis, preventing the flow of urine, then treat him with what I have mentioned before you reach the point of cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For many times have I been saved from cutting by this treatment; indeed, I have proved it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And you should take a perforator made of steel, whose form is this: with three-sided point, sharp, fixed in wood.  \\
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread and tie it with that thread under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the perforating iron into the thread with ease until the perforator reaches the stone itself; and turn the perforator in your hand little by little within the stone, trying to make a hole through it until you have made it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 For urine is immediately released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outside part of the thread.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 For it breaks and comes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 But if this cure is not prepared for you because of some obstacle from it, then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut on top of the stone in the same thread between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 After that, untie the knot and clean the congealed blood that forms at the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone except that it should not return to the bladder; and another thread above, except that when the thread is untied after the stone has come out, the skin may return to its place and cover the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for you to lift the skin upward when you tie the thread above, so that it returns to its proper place and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 ¶ On the extraction of a woman’s stone.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Stones are seldom generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 But if it happens to any of them that a stone is formed, then the cure is difficult and is prevented by many reasons. ¶ If it were possible for women to have their urethra opened with an incision, this would be beneficial; but because they are ashamed, they do not permit it. ¶ And if you wish to treat them with cautery or with cupping, it is difficult and not beneficial, nor can you draw out a stone from the bladder of women with a perforator or with any instrument, for their urethra is narrow and their genitalia are weak; therefore, there is no benefit in this. ¶ But if you wish to treat them with medicines, we have written about these in the chapter on the treatment of stones with medicines.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of them is that the woman might be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And the second is that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician when she is chaste or has a husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 The third is that you do not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And the fourth is the distance from the stone: therefore it needs a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity compels you to do this, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician who knows well; and she is found rarely.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 But if you are deprived of that, then seek a chaste physician who is skillful and present with a midwife well-versed in women's matters or with a woman who knows part of this art: make her present, especially to her, so that she may do all that you command her from the examination concerning the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 First of all, she should see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert her finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If she finds it, let her constrict it under her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and examine the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and press it with a good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the bladder's opening towards below with all her strength until it reaches the pubic bone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then she should cut above it at the midpoint of the vagina near the pubic bone on whatever side he prepares for her and feels the stone in that part; and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting under it; and let the first incision be small.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then let him insert a ray upon that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If he feels the stone, then let him add to the incision according to a proportionate amount so that the stone exits from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 From these are the small and large, the smooth and rough, the long and round, having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Know therefore its types, so that it may be indicated to you concerning what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If therefore blood overpowers you, then add ground barley to the place and hold it for one hour until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your procedure until the stone comes out: and prepare with you from the instruments that I mentioned for extracting stones in men, so that you may assist in your procedure through them.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 But if the flow of blood overpowers you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that was cut: then place powder on the spot and hold it with a proper tightening bandage: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 For perhaps the weakened woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When therefore the sharpness of the blood is calmed after a few days and the place becomes foul, then return to your procedure until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 ¶ Concerning the incision upon a hydrocele.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A hydrocele is nothing but a gathering of moisture in the white membrane called the sifac, which lies beneath the skin containing the testicle: and it is named the sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg until it becomes hard: and this is another egg, and it lies between the white membrane that we mentioned and the skin of the testicle: and this occurs rarely. ›
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And indeed the origin of this vein is from the weakness that occurs in the testicles; therefore, this material flows to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it happens due to a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 For indeed its color is inclined toward a yellowish hue, or it is blood red, or dark and dusky, or watery white, and the one that predominates is this last kind.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which you can know where the collection of water is are these:
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 For if it is in the white sac which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round and a little longer, like the shape of an egg; and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if the moisture is in its own little bag, then the swelling is round like part of an egg, and because of this a man thinks that there is another egg there.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sac, then it falls under the senses.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the swelling with the square tool, whose shape has been mentioned before.  />  And if it is red and dark as we have said, or yellowish or white like milk, it is healthy; but if it is black, it is corrupt.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to what comes out in the wake of the probe, judge that which is between them.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 Therefore, when we come to the treatment with fire, it is necessary that you instruct the patient that he should be bled if possible, and observe that his body is full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then let him lie on his back on something elevated slightly, and place many cloths under him.  />  After that, cauterize the swelling with a red-hot iron, large enough for this purpose, until the blood flows out; then let the patient be bled as we have said, until he sees his body becoming empty.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right side, so that he can stretch his leg toward one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and toward the pubic region of the abdomen.  />  And let him hold the leg in this position until the patient is healed from this ailment.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a sharp knife, and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise in the middle, almost to the comb: and let the incision be straight along an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white spermatic cord; and remove it carefully, or be cautious not to cut it; and let your incision, with which you remove it, extend more from the side where the egg is suspended. And examine it delicately together with the incision according to how much you are able.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then pierce the filled spermatic cord with a wide puncture, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the spermatic cord upward, without touching the skin that surrounds the testicles: and cut the spermatic cord in whatever way is possible for you to cut it, either completely or piece by piece, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not carefully examine [it], there will be no security that the water does not return in the incision.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 But if the egg comes out of its skin during your operation: then when you have filled the incision of the spermatic cord, return it [the egg].
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find a corrupted egg due to other blackness, then it is necessary for you to tie the vessels that are the suspension, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then cut off the testicle with its suspension, and remove the egg; afterwards treat it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 But if the water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part equally as you did with the first one.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it seems to you that it should be done in one operation, then do [it]: then clean the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And introduce wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions; and place another piece of wool that you have soaked in wine and oil on the outside, and spread it over the two testicles and the navel; and put doubled cloths on top, which are made from felt, and tie them on top with a cord that has six [strands], following this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then let there be taken two cloths and they should be moistened and filled with wool carded as follows: and the ends should be made which are pressed with cotton or wet wool; and they are bound together at the waist of the undergarments; and one end reaches over the buttocks to the back, and the second reaches toward the pubic region; and two ends go below the two hips, and two other ends go above the two groins, and all is tied together at the waist of the undergarment.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes this hernia is artificially treated with a cautery at the site of the incision. It is done by taking a fine surgical scalpel and cutting through the skin of the testicles; and it is heated as we have described until, when the white thread containing water is exposed, then take the cautery in this manner.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 It resembles the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce through it with the cautery, and it is heated until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then stretch the thread with pincers and burn it with a heated fine scalpel, and cut it as much as you can until you remove all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And be careful that the fire does not touch the egg.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this procedure is safer and causes less bleeding, and it is better than the procedure with an incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 But if during the hour of incision or the hour of cauterization there is a hot abscess or bleeding or anything else causing difficulty, then it is necessary to treat whatever is causing the difficulty with an appropriate treatment, as was mentioned before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If, however, the patient is fearful and does not expect this operation due to its horror, then perform the perforation as I have described it: and it is so.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When it is confirmed to you through what we have said about the indications that the vein is watery, then you should make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a broad probe; and make the incision along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place a bandage on the spot and bind it; and let it remain until the remaining water flows out; then care for him until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 But if there is resistance to the discharge of water at the time you pierce it, and this is not because the vein is obstructed, but only because a white membrane is causing obstruction at the opening of the wound and preventing the water from exiting, then you should insert a feather into the wound or an instrument with which the water of dropsical patients is drawn out, whose form I have described earlier; or delay the operation on the wound for a while.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or about that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 Therefore, when it accumulates again, then it should be pierced in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 ¶ On the treatment of fleshy veins.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter LXIII
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that in the incision on this vein there is fear of causing death in many dispositions. ️
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore, it seems to me that its release is safer for this reason.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I remember the procedure on it and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the body from which testicles are composed, and this happens for many reasons, namely. ️
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 From an excess of sharp or bitter fluid that is discharged onto the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the appearance of the swelling matches the color of the body, and it does not cause pain; this is a serious swelling.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stone-like swelling, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it happens from the knotting and swelling of the arteries, as has been previously mentioned; or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 Therefore, that which is from them by swelling of the arteries is recognized by the arrangement of the swelling when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And it should not be touched at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 However, that which is from swelling of the veins does not ooze anything when pressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And it is possible that incision can be made on this type and on other flesh; it is as if you were to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then extend the egg upwards and extract it with a white sponge; free the spermatic cord from the vessels and tie the vessels; cut the spermatic cord after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If therefore the egg is solidified with those native tissues, then it is necessary to pull out the egg and cut into it.  />
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an adhesion between some part of the sponge or between the vessels, then it is necessary to free that entire adhesion and cut through it with a round incision.  />  />
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 But if there is a growth of tissue at the site of the adhesion behind it, then it is necessary to cut through all of it and extract the egg, as we have said.  />  />  />
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 § On the care of the hands, which is with the tendons.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 The tendons are a swelling wrapped in some wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with the softening of the testicles; and it becomes difficult for the patient to move, exercise, or walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this disease, there is fear from the memory of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 Indeed, we must say that the operation on it should be done according to what was first done.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 I say, therefore, that you should have the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then push the scrotum downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the scrotum with your fingers, together with the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another assistant hold it and stretch it strongly.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then cut with a broad, sharp scalpel across the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then peel it from all sides, as we have told you in the removal of the temporal arteries. ›
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then pierce it with a needle that has two threads, and tie the thread first at the place where the tendons come together; and tie it again at their end. › ›
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it with a straight cut along the length of the body, and remove what has accumulated from foul, corrupted moisture.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, so that there will be strength to generate pus, until the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not a harm in this way.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 But if the tendons are affected in all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove the testicles with the vessels; so that the egg may not be deprived of nourishment because of the incision, and waste away or dry up, and there will be no benefit from them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 The care of the rectum and intestines.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The outcome of this rectal issue is from a cut, which occurs in the scrotum extended over the abdomen at the groin from the navel.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the scrotum or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the sign, when it is from the extension of the scrotum. ‌
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and there is an abscess of equal depth: because the scrotum compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And the sign of it when it is from a cut in the scrotum, because at its beginning it causes a sudden and severe pain: and there is an abscess that appears near the surface of the skin: and this is due to the exit of the intestine and its course to the outside of the scrotum. ‌
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it exits with the intestine and the testicle: and this is called rectal intestine and testicle: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes feces runs into the intestine and is retained there: and with it is the destruction of the sick person: because it causes a severe pain, especially when pressed upon.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in treating these types of illness with iron, there is fear: therefore one must be careful to avoid this error.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 And the method of treatment is that you should instruct the patient to return the intestine by his own hand into the interior of his pelvis, if it is willing to return. ‌ ‌
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he should be made to lie on his back between your hands: and lift his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut through the entire length of the scrotal skin.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then insert hooks into the two lips of the incision according to your need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be such that it is possible for an egg to emerge from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape away the peritoneum and what is beneath the skin of the testicles until you uncover the white, hard album on all sides. Then insert your index finger between the testicle and that white album which lies beneath the skin, and separate it from the membrane at the back of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move the skin of the testicles towards the inside with your right hand, and at the same time stretch the white album upwards with your left hand; and lift the egg with its membrane towards the incision; and instruct your assistant to lift the egg upwards; and you separate the adhesion behind after the separation is completed.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And search with your fingers to see if there is anything of the intestine twisted within the hard white membrane.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If, however, you find anything, then push it down towards the abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take a needle with a thick thread made from ten threads of linen; and insert it at the bottom of the membrane, that is, the tunica, which lies beneath the skin following the incision; then cut the ends of the thread that protrude until four threads remain.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then arrange some of them over others in the shape of a cross; and tie with them that membrane which we have spoken of, since it is beneath the skin of the testicles, with a strong ligature, so that none of the vessels which nourish them may send anything to them; lest there occur from this a hot abscess.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place another ligature following the first ligature, more distant from it by two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligatures leave out from the scrotal sac, which is under the skin of the testicles, an amount equal to the size of a finger: and cut off the rest entirely following its roundness, and remove the testicle from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles with a section from which blood and pus flow, as we have described in what precedes.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound, and apply the ligature that we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes the white scrotal sac which we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For often it happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be soaked in warm water; and place on it that which we have mentioned until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 ¶ Concerning the Swollen Anus.
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this case of swollen anus I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.  /> But if he wants to use iron, let him cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and let him cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let him introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And indeed the first [authorities] said that it is done just as we have described in the case of piles with a fleshy base.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 That is to say, after the incision sew up the skin beneath it with ease; then cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> But there are those who want to cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And there are some who say that if they are not able to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And if it is not possible to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And there are those who say that if they are not able to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And if it is not possible to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And there are those who say that if they are not able to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And if it is not possible to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 "On ruptures that occur in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	 Chapter LXVII
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the area swells and nothing from the intestines descends: if it does descend, it is little and returns in all hours; but if this condition is prolonged, a tear forms in the scrotum until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 This occurs due to the stretching of the scrotum in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 Which is because the scrotum is stretched; then it softens and becomes swollen, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its treatment is with cautery, as was told in its preceding account.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 Sometimes it is treated with a knife in this manner: the patient should lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the area of the ruptured and swollen protrusion with a longitudinal incision, to a width of three fingers. ‌
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then tie the scrotum and its contents under the skin until the white scrotum that follows it is exposed.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take a bandage and place it over the protruding area of the scrotum, and press it deeply into the abdomen. ‌
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then if there are two protruding areas at the end of the bandage from the scrotum, and join one with the other using a stitch; then remove the end of the bandage.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor pull on the testicle or anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernias.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then treat it with wound care.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 When you cut the threads, clean it and close the wound until it heals. ‌ ‌
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 For the scrotum contracts and no swelling of the rupture occurs. ‌
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And cautery is better in this place because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter 68
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The skin of the testicles is often softened in certain men, causing the flesh between them to become soft and their appearance to be disfigured.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore it is necessary for the person who is asked to treat this condition to make the patient lie on his back and cut away all the softened skin down to the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then bring together the two lips with stitches; and if you wish, first remove any excess of the softened skin with three or four stitches, and make the stitching firm.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	 § On castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter 69
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that castration is forbidden by our law and therefore it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine. And mentioning it is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 The first reason is so that a doctor may know about it when asked about it, and be able to treat someone who has undergone it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 The second reason is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our own benefit, such as rams, donkeys, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore that castration can be done in two ways. 
Aut per attritionem.	 Either by rubbing.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by cutting and slicing.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In the method of rubbing, the way to do it is this: make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles soften and relax and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and cannot be felt.   
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 "However, in castration by tearing and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and press its testicular skin with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 "Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above each testicle with one cut until two testicles come out. After skinning both, incise them after you have removed from the scrotum everything except the fine skin that is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 "And this method of castration is better than that which is done by friction, because friction perhaps leaves something of the testicles, so that the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 "Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 "§ On caring for a hermaphrodite of two kinds.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 "A hermaphrodite is made from men in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 "One way is that it appears in him following the space, or on the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, in the form of a woman's vulva, with hair: and sometimes urine flows from what is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 "In women, however, there is only one form, and it is like a woman's vulva on the pubis, just as if small male testicles were very prominent towards the outside: of which one is like the male penis, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 "And the treatment for these three kinds—the two from men and the one from women—is that you should cut away the attached flesh until its impression is removed.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 "Then treat them with the care of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 "In the second type of men, from which urine exits and is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation or care at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 "§ On the cutting of excrescences and prominent flesh in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 Possibly the disease is added to a natural part, until it becomes ugly and unsightly: And sometimes it is greatly magnified in certain women, so much so that it expands as in men, and reaches the point of coition.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, you should hold the excess of the disease with your hand or with a hook, and cut it off: And do not proceed too far with the cutting, especially at the root of the deep part: So that there is no flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it as you would a wound, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 But the flesh that is born is the flesh that grows in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it: And perhaps it goes out to the outside like a tail: And because of this some call it a 'tailed disease'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, you should cut it off as you would the wart, and care for it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 ¶ About treating ulceration, which is an unperforated woman's genital sore.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 An ulceration is when a woman has a sore that is not perforated, or has only a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it is either natural or accidental. ️
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 An accidental one is due to a previous disease: And this itself occurs either from added flesh that was born, or from sifach (a type of skin lesion), whether thin or thick. And it forms either in the depths of the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or its lower part: And it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps even menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 And recognition of it is done by the midwife's inspection, if there is an apparent swelling nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not visible, then seek it with your fingers or with a stick.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 But if the swelling is from thin sifach and is near the two lips, then hasten and tear it off. ️ ️ ️
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And it is like this: place small pills on the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place your fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then stretch both lips with strength until the fine sifak is torn open and the clitoris is exposed.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman come every day, so that the place does not heal in another way.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 But if the sifak is thick and dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 But if the clitoris is fleshy: then suspend it with hooks and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without cauterization, such as acacia and dragon's blood, and egg white mixed with the white of an egg.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a large lead pipe so that the wound does not heal quickly, let her keep it for some days: and administer dry flax thread, then continue with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes a birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: it is therefore necessary to cut them like this: as long as there is no cancerous tumor in the womb, for with a cancerous tumor that is in the womb, do not use iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 ¶ On the care of hemorrhoids, and red bothers in women's wounds.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood runs from them constantly. xspace
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 Therefore, when hemorrhoids are aggravated, they become tender; and I have already spoken of their division into species and signs in the section on them: and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are at the entrance of the womb and do not protrude: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 Those which are at the entrance of the womb and upon which one feels something are those that can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then, extend the perineum with scissors or with a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then sprinkle on them a powder that stops bleeding from one of the wound-healing powders without cauterization: such as acacia, dragon's blood, sumac, and similar ones.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then have her press her feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Afterwards, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the bleeding persists: then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rinds, oak galls, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If the blood clots with it, that is good; if not, apply a cupping glass to her back and breasts without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and soak it in the juice of tamarisk or the juice of sea lavender or the juice of oleander branches, that is, aglander, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When the abscess has quieted down, then treat the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 Albarth, however, is reddish and resembles the heads of alfalfa, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut away what appears from it, as I said about hemorrhoids equally: and treat it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 Perforation of the vagina that occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXIIII.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 There are many kinds of tumors that occur in the womb, such as cancer, stone tumors, ulcers, abscesses, carbuncles (i.e., herpes), abscesses with pustules, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, and warm tumors.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And indeed, I have already mentioned all these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the division. It is necessary for me to speak about warm tumors that occur in the womb, when it is among the tumors that collect pus, and I want to know how its opening with iron is done.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, you should consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 If the pain of the tumor is sharp at its onset with swelling, heat, and fever, and you see it become red; if sensation is lost over it, then do not hurry to open it; and treat it with what helps until the tumor matures, until the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat that has two holes, and let her lean forward, or have her lie on her back, and gather her feet towards the lower part of the belly; and let her hips be spread apart, and let her place her arms under her knees, and bind each with an appropriate ligament.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Whose form comes in what follows.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And when you want to administer this instrument, it is necessary that you pierce the deep part of the woman's womb with a rod; so that what enters from the instrument is no more than the depth of the womb, and does not harm the sick one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the instrument is deeper than necessary, then you should place cotton over the opening of the deep womb to prevent the entire instrument from entering into the deep womb; and it is necessary that a screw be placed on the side of the instrument, which runs along the instrument, so that it can hold the instrument and so that an assistant turns the screw until the deep womb opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When it appears at the orifice, and can be touched with the hand, and is soft and gentle, then you should cut it at its head with a broad knife.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When the wound is cleaned of pus, then you should place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent properties over the wound, and apply pressure, and extract the incision from the deep womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And place externally over the womb and over the pubic bone a clean linen cloth soaked in water in which mulberries have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be cleaned after two days with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to using an ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then you should avoid treating it with iron; rather, treat it with what we have mentioned in the section on division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 ¶ The Art of Midwifery: How to Treat Live Embryos that Exit in an Abnormal Form.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 The midwife must first know the natural form of childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 From its signs, you will know that when a woman begins to feel pressure in her lower abdomen and desires fresh air, and what is above her womb is relieved, and the exit of the embryo hastens; then you should know that this birth is according to the natural form, and it exits with its head first, and the amnion either hangs from or follows the umbilical cord. ➤
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 When you see these signs, then it is necessary that his abdomen be pressed so that the child may quickly descend.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 For when it descends upon its head, the afterbirth also descends with it and is purified from those excesses by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But he who is born other than this way is unnatural and inauspicious.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 For sometimes the fetus emerges feet first, and its body comes out before its head, or one of its feet or both of its hands, or only one foot; or it may come out head first with one hand; or perhaps the abdomen protrudes, and possibly turns over onto its neck, and other similar inauspicious positions. 》
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore it is necessary that the midwife be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and guard herself from error and deception. And I will show every figure of them, and what is its nature, and what it signifies, and how to handle it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus emerges head first in its natural way of birth, and it becomes violent towards the woman, and her labor is difficult, and you see that her strength has already been weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or have women hold her; and fumigate her vulva with fenugreek boiled in water and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the midwife should insert a small spatula between her fingers, and she should probe with it to find the afterbirth, and she should cut it with her nail until the moisture flows from it; and she should press on the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 After the enema, instruct her to press on herself; and make her sneeze with pepper, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus will immediately emerge.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary to gently bring them back little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If it does not comply at the entrance, then place the woman on a stool and lift her feet upwards; then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them off and extract the rest of the fetus; and bind the hand with cloth, and extract it equally, for he will emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The exit of the embryo is over his feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus emerges over his feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then gradually turn the fetus; afterwards, even it out.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they emerge up to the hips, then tell her to push and make her sneeze with vinegar; for he will come out if God wishes it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not emerge with that which I have narrated, then gradually bring the fetus back until you place him according to his natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For he will come out then with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 But if he is hindered with all that I have narrated, then take from mucilage of flaxseed, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum; and pound it all well in a mortar; then bind her vulva and the lower part of her womb with it.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until she reaches the stage of labor pains.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that his lower parts are already warm, then make her a fumigant of myrrh; and apply it to him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 Then when he has taken the fumigation for one hour, make her sit on a stool. ›
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze: and bind her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with gentle compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 The exit of the fetus is between the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it comes out in this manner, then she should insert her hands gradually. ︎
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman should be laid back on her neck, and her feet should hang down; and she should lie on the bed, and she should wrap her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gently above her belly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then pull out what is under her feet from the cushions, until it is prepared at the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 But if the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them strongly.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press gently above the hypochondrium until the fetus rises upwards.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then she should insert her hands and straighten the fetus gradually; and command the woman to push until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 She should insert her hand for its delivery.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 But if she cannot deliver it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 However, if she cannot walk, then lay her on the bed; and shake her legs vigorously. ︎ ︎
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the poultice that you have prepared from the mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 But if she is about to give birth, then make her sit on a stool.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then strive to deliver it by hand, and straighten the fetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and command her to push until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The exit of the fetus on its neck, with hands spread out, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The midwife should hold the fetus's hand, then slowly turn it and adjust it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it has been adjusted, place on its lips what we have spoken of from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then order her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done this, then make her sit on a chair and order her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then tell her to press down and make her sneeze with your help.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The exit of the prepared fetus is on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it has descended to the opening of the womb along with the afterbirth in this manner, then cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is expelled from the moisture.  />
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If it hangs over the face and neck of the fetus, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and causes death.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus inside until you place it as necessary, and tell the woman to press herself several times, for it will come out easily.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 The exit of twins or many fetuses.  />  />  />  />
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins often are born and sometimes three, and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, this is unusual and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 Five is against nature and they do not live at all. Even if they multiply, one afterbirth contains them all, and they are separated by a membrane distinguishing between the ligament of each one's navel.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they come out as one fetus comes out naturally and easily through the birth canal, and they come out in an admirable way, as we have said.  />  />  />  />  />
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 But if some of them are difficult during birth and reach the condition we have mentioned from unnatural shapes, then treat them as we have said: and let the midwife be skillful and do what she does with ease and delay, and she should adapt to every shape along with what is prepared for her by her guiding wisdom towards health.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos and then miscarried.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one is formed in the womb, or two, three, four, five, six, seven, and sometimes more than ten: and indeed I have seen with my own eyes a woman miscarry seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 This was accomplished by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, all this should be within the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 For perhaps something similar to that will happen to her: therefore she should oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 ¶ On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter 76
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you are treating a dead fetus with the division I mentioned in the treatment, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use manual intervention, then you should consider this.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If therefore the woman is of sound constitution and not suffering from any of the conditions that might cause her to be lost, then it is necessary for the woman to be placed on her back on a bed, with her head tilted downwards and her legs raised; and let a midwife hold her by both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils and linseed, and fenugreek seed mucilage.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should introduce it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then let her seek with it the place where she can grab the hooks from the fetus and the places suitable for this.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore consider then, if the fetus is ready to descend head first: then insert the hooks into its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or in its shoulder blades, or in places near the ribs and under the hypochondria. ︎
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If however the descent is upon his feet, then in the comb and middle ribs of him.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And he should hold the hook with his right hand and place its curvature between the fingers of his left hand. He should then easily insert it with his hand and fix the hook in one of those places that we have mentioned until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then he should insert another hook or a third one, if necessary, on the opposite side so that there is an equal contraction and it does not deviate to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then it should be stretched equally and not only straight but moved in every direction to facilitate its exit, just as is done with a tooth when it is extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And between that, there should be something to soften the stretching.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part is retained from it, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them to roll out whatever is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then they should change the hooks to a higher place: do this until the entire fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If therefore a hand emerges before the other and it is not possible to return it due to its constriction, then they should wrap a cloth around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then draw it out until when the whole emerges; cut it either at the junction of the sole or at the elbow: and thus you should do with the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If however the fetal head is large or it encounters constriction during birth or there is water collected on its head, then they should insert a thorny spatula between the fingers and shred the head with it to extract the water or break it with an instrument called Almisdac: the shape of which comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, do this if the fetus has a large head by nature: then it is necessary to cut away the alkengematu; or extract it with misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head comes out but is constricted at the shoulders, then it should be cut until the fluid from the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If however it does not become entangled nor yield to delivery, then cut off the head in pieces, as much as you are able.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If there is a tumor or swelling below the navel, or if it is caused by dropsy, then you should pierce it until the fluid runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 However, if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction towards the mouth of the womb is straightforward.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If however it is constricted at the abdomen or chest, then you should extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut open the abdomen or chest until the fluid runs out of them.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If however the other members are extracted and only the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb and seek out the head with it, and draw it towards the mouth of the womb with her fingers; then she should insert a hook or two hooks into it, and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the mouth of the womb is constricted due to a hot tumor that has occurred there, then it should not be labored upon, but rather warm and oily substances should be administered; and apply poultices; and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is lying on its side, then it may turn; then administer what we have said for a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If that is not possible, then it should be cut piece by piece and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And you must not leave anything from the placenta inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said for hot swellings that occur in the womb.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If a flow of blood occurs, let it descend into stiptic waters, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 And indeed I have already seen a woman in whose womb a dead fetus was; then she became pregnant with another in its place, after which another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it became swollen until it was opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore called for her cure, and I treated her over a long time: but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 I therefore placed upon it some strong drawing plasters: and a mouth came out from that place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then some days passed for her, and another mouth came out. 
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I was therefore amazed by this, since there is no mouth in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 I therefore thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore searched the wound and extracted many bones, while the woman was in a better condition; and she has now lived thus for a long time, and sends forth from that place only a little pus.  />
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I would not have introduced this foreign matter here, except that it contains knowledge and assistance for what the medical artist administers with his hand in a cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 § On the forms of the necessary instruments for fetal extraction.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here below is the form of the straps with which books are bound, having two windings at the ends of two pieces of wood, each being equal to the other.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 Verily, this vertigo should be made of more delicate silk, and to make it, either from ebony or boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the width of each piece of wood is as if two fingers, and the edge of each is as one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two additions of the same type of wood, which are already fixed on both sides, whose length is more or less half a palm, and the width of each is as if two fingers, or more or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the womb, so that it may be opened with them when you roll up the two vertigines.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The shape of the vertigo which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another shape, similar to it, more delicate and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 It should be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 However, at the end of it there should be two additions, as you see here above; and the length of each addition is as if a palm, and the width of each is as two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 Therefore, when you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on the bed with her feet hanging down, and that which is between her legs being open.  \\
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two joined additions into the womb; and you are holding the end of the instrument below between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount that you wish for the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 The shape of another vertigo which the ancients called the form of the expeller by which the fetus is expelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The shape of the Almisdal, by which a large head is crushed; and it resembles a forceps, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it is made like a pair of tongs, as you see here in this shape, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The form of Almisdac by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The shape of a vice with one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The shape of a vice having two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The form of tongs which have saw teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The shape of scissors having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The shape of two wide scissors as well.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 All these instruments are used, and the more their forms are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the faster he is at his work and the higher he is esteemed among men for their number.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not despise any of these instruments, so that it may be prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 ¶ On the Extraction of a Second Twin. xspace 🚫
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When a second twin is retained at birth, then you should advise the woman to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with you: and place your hand over her mouth and nose.  />
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If it then emerges by this method, that is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in its lid. Place in it the following opening-the-womb herbs: calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, anise, cassia bark, and centaury. Take all these herbs or some of them, submerge them in water, and place them over a fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place a reed in the hole of the pot's lid, with the other end in the mouth of the womb, and let her hold it until the steam reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For the afterbirth will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or thickened mallow juice.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then she should insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When she has found it, then she should take hold of it and gently pull it out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 But if it is attached deep within the womb, then she should insert her hand as we have described until she finds the afterbirth and draws it out little by little straight forward so that the womb does not suddenly contract; rather it should gently shift from side to side. Then increase the pulling force gradually.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 In this way she will comply and be saved and escape from being stuck.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 But if the mouth of the womb is narrowed as we have already described, care for her with sneezing and potions made from herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 But if it does not come out despite all these efforts, be careful not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 Instead, whatever comes out towards the mouth of the womb should be tied to the woman's thigh. 
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then give her an enema with four-ingredient ointment. 
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For it will decay after a few days and be expelled.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it begins to decay, the smell will rise to her head and stomach and harm her.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered for that purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already found that a fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs is effective for this. 
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The design of the device used to fumigate a woman who has retained her afterbirth or menses.  
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make something similar to alcama or from mustard seed: and place the broad end over the fire: and the smoke should be placed above the embers: hold it until that smoke is consumed: and repeat with another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Of the treatment of unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many infants are born whose anus is not perforated, which a soft syringe has already probed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that with her finger; and if not, let her pierce it with a sharp probe, and be careful that her arm does not touch him.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place a wool cloth soaked in wine and oil upon him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with salves until he is cured.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 However, if you fear that it will become blocked again, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate. ️
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now, obstruction of the anus also occurs due to the healing of a wound or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, it is necessary that that healing be cut out; then treat it as we have said with the treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 ¶ Of the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 The fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodules and swellings that occur near the anus externally; or within the space of one part; and there is one fistula, or many. ️ ️
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 Therefore, when that nodule becomes chronic, it opens, and from it flows an aqueous white fluid, or thin pus. ️ ️ ️
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, penetrating ones are known by what comes out from defecation and flatulence when the patient uses defecation; and perhaps a worm comes out of them. ️
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And among them are fistulas when they penetrate into the space of the bladder and to the urethral orifice.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And among them are those that penetrate to the hip joint and to the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 The way to distinguish whether a fistula penetrates to the anus, even if it does not penetrate, is this: insert your index finger into the anus and insert a fine probe made of iron or brass into the fistula when there is no curvature.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 But if there is curvature, then insert into it a fine probe made of lead or a horsehair until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it at all, and nothing comes out of the opening upon emptying, nor is there any gas or worm as I have said, then know that it is not penetrating; hasten to its cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or the urethral opening, then its indication is the passage of urine from it; and its cure is to close off this passage so that the area may be healed with medicine.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 But if it penetrates to the hip joint or the mouth of the hip, then its sign is that a probe reaches there if there is no curvature up to the mouth; and finding pain around the part, and that pus always comes out from it; and that medication does not help it, nor does it heal with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their cure is labor and vanity for the foolish doctor who attempts it.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 But in that which is not penetrating and is not old, healing with a saw is hoped for; as I have told you, and I have already proved it: and the procedure is this, that the patient lies on his back between your hands; and raise his legs up to above his hips, and let his hips be bent toward his abdomen.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then he should insert a probe of lead or iron into the fistula, if there is tortuosity, until he knows where the probe has arrived.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 But if the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 Therefore, if you feel the probe has already penetrated through the body and beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula or skin, then know for certain that it is a penetrating fistula; do not labor on it, for there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 However, it is said that in some people the flesh heals and from the medication by which it is hoped for help, let a fine cautery be ignited according to the width of the fistula as previously mentioned, and insert the burning cautery into the fistula until it reaches the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those added fleshy parts, which are like a bird's feather quill, have been burned away.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter until the burned flesh comes out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and strengthen it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If it heals, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it will never be cured by any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 And if the probe comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or skin between it and the probe, and you see that the fistula follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula and proceed cutting along with the probe that is in the fistula until the cutting reaches where the tip of the probe was, and the probe is released and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean those fleshy parts that are like a bird's feather quill, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If blood overcomes you and loosens between you and your surgery so that it separates those flesh pieces, then it is better for a quicker healing to cauterize them with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Because a cautery with fire brings together good conditions: the burning of those flesh pieces, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying out of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then care for it with bandages wrapped in butter or crushed cabbage leaves until the place releases pus, and those burnt flesh pieces come out in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then care for the wound with healing ointments that produce hard flesh; and there are medicines which contain astringents and drying agents.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when they are restored, then it is healed: and you should not fear recurrence.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 But if the fistula has already reached as far as the deep part of the anus and is lengthened by the body's excess, then insert your finger into the anus and search with it.  />
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 Therefore if you feel a swelling and there is a membrane of silk or flesh between you and it, which is close to penetrating, then the operation on that [fistula] is not possible except by way of hope and expectation.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 That is, because in it [the fistula] one of three methods is applied: either to cauterize it as we said, or to cut it away until you reach its concavity so that it is possible for you to insert bandages and immediate care.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed much with the cutting so that you do not cut into the band that contains the anus and cause an unfortunate exit of excrement without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for it with what we said.  />  />
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 Perhaps it will heal; or else you lengthen the membrane itself and cleanse it after you have cut it almost to the anus, as we said, either with a probe or with some other sharp instrument.  />  />  />  />  />  />
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then cleanse those filtered meats that are in the incision as far as you can with probing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision and the upper opening where it heals; and there will remain an open fistula in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier for the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes the fistula occurs in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and the edge of the anus; then take a perforated probe at the tip, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, prepared from rawhide, in this manner.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a thread wound with five threads, and about such.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its hollow part.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If therefore it penetrates near the inner edge of the anus, then draw out the thread from that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus and extract the end of the thread, and bring together both ends at once; and tie each one, and leave it for one day or two days; and however more the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it well until those flesh parts between the two ends of the thread are cut off and fall away; then care for the wound until it heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then cause it to penetrate by whatever manner you prepare for yourself, except if it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For indeed it is not for you to do that because of the arm [strength], so that you do not cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then deal with it as we said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The form of a sharp spatule that is used to divide the fistula, whose curve is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is unnecessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 On the stitching of hemorrhoids from which blood flows due to their incision: and the care of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 There are two types of hemorrhoids.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 For they are either within the anus, similar to small blisters or plums, or as if they were grains of grapes themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And from them are small and large ones: and blood always flows from them, whether there is one or many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And they are outside the anus, and at its edges.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those that are outside the anus are for the most part moist and of little water, from which flows yellowish water or a small amount of blood with constant discharge: and they are the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And its treatment, when it is within the anus, is that you order the patient to sit down: and let it be squeezed out until the anus protrudes and appears to you like a hemorrhoid.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, hang them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail. 
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If hooks do not hold them because of their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or a piece of woolen material and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them, and after the cutting, sprinkle some hot powders on them so that they act as a caustic.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or cauterize them according to what has been said in the chapter on cauterization.  
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not protrude, then give the patient an enema containing a mild purgative, so that it washes with what is in the anus and quickly obeys the expulsion when the patient presses.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If the worms are outside from the anus, then their nature is light and easy. And it is as if you take them with your fingernail or take them with a hook, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with what we have said until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And if someone is repelled by the incision with iron, then it is necessary for you to apply their stitches in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a thread wound around itself and insert it into a needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then draw out the worm upwards and make it penetrate with the needle into its root on the other side; and wrap the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle in a broad manner, and tighten the worm with a strong constriction.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then tie the thread and withdraw the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all the worms, and leave one out of them; do not remove it so that the blood can flow out from there.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cedar oil and put it on the anus; and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then leave him until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 So when the worms fall out, care for them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 ¶ On the Care of Fissures
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For it often happens from the drying out of feces and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 Therefore, when they become chronic and medicine is ineffective on them, then it is necessary that you shave them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they become moist, and remove from them the upper skin which prevents them from healing.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then care for them until they heal as is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 But if they do not heal, then shave them with a more severe scraping than the first until they bleed profusely; and then care for them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 "About treating inverted and uninverted almirma, as well as athelil scars and formicae.
Caput LXXXII.	 "Chapter Eighty-Two.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 "Know that almirmar is nothing but a round knot of the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail; and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and from this comes pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 "Therefore, it should be cut around like the head of a nail and held with tweezers or a hook, and removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 "Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it as explained in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 "Athelil, however, is one small rough and pitted roundness above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 "And they often occur on children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 "Its treatment is that you stretch the athelil and cut it, or bind it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 "And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine, as mentioned before, and now inverted and uninverted athelil will be removed with the instrument that I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 "Formica, however, is also a small rough and pitted raised area on the surface of the body, going very deep; and when cold touches it, it feels like an ant bite, and this occurs throughout the body, but most often on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 "Its treatment is to take a small tube made from a goose feather or a strong vulture feather; and place this tube over the formica until the circumference of the tube contains its edges.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 "Then roll your hand with the tube until it cuts through the edges of the formica; and place it deeply into the flesh, removing the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, make that with an air tube or iron tube, according to this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Let the upper part of the tube be at the height, pulling the swab wrapped around it so that its grasp and rolling off are lessened.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish, burn the formica as mentioned in the section on burning athelil in the chapter on the cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 About the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus and for relieving flatulence and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or copper, or cast bronze, or hammered iron.  /> ¶ Et si uis, fac eum ex quercu, secundum hanc formam:
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes it is made from these instruments, both small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore, what is administered for the treatment of small children should be small; and whatever their anus is weak or painful, thus also should be the enema.  /> ¶ Illud autem quod administratur in curatione adultorum sit magnum.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The tube of it, that is the upper end where the bladder is tied, should be wide like this: and there should be a distinct part so that the bladder can be tied as you see, and its lower end which enters the anus should be blunt, that is not open, very smooth, pulling to subtlety; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and slightly thicker; and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be from a pig's bladder or from sheepskin that is according to the shape of a small asparagus leaf, whose stem is one palm long.  /> ¶ Et sit canna eius uel argentea, uel ex aere fuso.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And let it be pierced with many holes as if rolled out, and let there be a space between each hole the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then put into those holes a thread of raw silk, which should be made up of ten threads or about that number, and attach to it a bag like an esophagus.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When the bag is put into it, let the enema be tied at the head between two restricting ligatures with a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then give an enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the shape of the bag here depicted, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of giving an enema with it is this: that you fill the bag or bladder with medicine that has been heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not too hot nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then let the patient lie on their back and lift up their legs; and place under them an intahaan, that is, a hide on which people lie, or a cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the end of the enema with oil, or with the white of an egg, or with a thickening made from fenugreek, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then introduce it into the anus gently.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then let the attendant take the bag with both hands at once and squeeze it forcefully until all the contents of the enema have been expelled into the intestine.  ?>
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the enema, and let the patient raise their legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine causes him to move his bowels, then he should hold it as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps with it the whole night through, it is more beneficial.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 But if you give him an enema during an attack of diarrhea and his discharge is rapid; then repeat the enema until he is well.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 But if there are hemorrhoids or painful boils in the anus, then let the enema be very fine and gentle, like those used to give enemas to children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And let this be the form of a fine enema on which the skin is tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Concerning the treatment of head wounds without broken bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter 84
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have already spoken in the division on the treatment of wounds what was fitting for a book, and here I will speak about their treatment both with hands and with medicines according to their due course.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to what causes the wound, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 The things by which wounds are made are often like the throwing of a stone: or the cut of a sword, or a knife: or striking with a spear, or a stick, or an arrow: and similar things from many objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 But the wounds that are made according to places of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver: and similar from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am relating the treatment of some wounds so that I may put forth that reasoning and rule upon other wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the reminder of compounded (wounds) will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore, I say:
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 If a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no broken bone, then consider whether it is from the throwing of a stone or similar objects and has already torn only the skin: and it is a large wound and you fear an unfavorable outcome from hot inflammation: then hasten and perform a phlebotomy immediately, do not delay it; and draw out some blood according to its strength, if there is nothing preventing the phlebotomy, especially if the amount of blood coming out of the wound is small.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And let the patient beware of overeating, wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 But if anything prevents him from eating in moderation, then let him be fed less, and let him not approach meats or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And place on the wound, if a hot abscess forms, only boiled linseed oil, or with wine that has been boiled down to a thick syrup.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 But if you are confident that a hot abscess will not form, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and has not been exposed to the air, the powder that I will describe shortly: and if the wound has already been exposed to the air, then apply certain ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 But if the wound is large, or is from a sword cut and similar things, and its lips do not come together by themselves, then bring them together with stitching, as I will describe in the chapter on wounds of the abdomen regarding their stitching.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 But if the wound has already been laid open to the bone and hangs loose, and there is no obstacle to its healing except for a small flap of skin, then cut away that flap.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then treat the wound with medicines and restore to it hard flesh in place of skin. And instruct the patient to be fed foods that are thick, such as grain porridge, until it becomes like a porridge, and similar foods.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 But if you find rotting flesh that does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all of the rotten flesh and cast it aside; then treat the wound.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it does not close by itself with medicines, then search for the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 Therefore, if you find that it is not cut through, then cut it with a sharp instrument or tie it off.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If necessity requires it when that which I have said is of no use, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If, however, these wounds are small and simple, then their condition is easy and light: so that you should sprinkle this powder over them, for it consolidates them before the air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 The Method of the Flesh-making Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part frankincense, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime. Grind all together thoroughly, and sift it. Fill the wound with this powder, and bind it well until it adheres firmly to it and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind it above with fine cloths, and leave it untouched, not unbinding it until it is well healed so that it does not open again.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense at hand; and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many of the great wounds, when it is placed upon them and bound, and they are recent wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 But if the air has already altered them in some way, especially when it is summertime, then this powder is not intended for such a position; therefore, care for it with what I have said, placing upon it certain digestive unguents, or place upon it poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until they emit pus. 》
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 But if a fracture occurs with the wound and it is small, then extract that with forceps; and I will now speak of the treatment of skull fractures in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 About Wounds of the Neck
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter LXXXV
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If however a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference between it and a simple head wound in terms of treatment.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 But if a nerve of the neck or an artery has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy for it except to avoid treating it with anything that causes strong coagulation, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because they harm nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not put anything cold at all on the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than other members: and that which is used for treatment should be from mild medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water infused many times with oil or rose oil, and tuthia when it is also washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones according to this method, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If however the wound is large, then apply a suture: or sew its lips together with silk threads.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 But if the wound is deep or an abscess has formed at its lower part where pus is already accumulating, then pierce it in the deeper place of that part.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 And if an artery has been cut in the wound and its blood flow has followed: then separate it or cut it off and tie it: or cauterize it if necessity demands that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 But if the thyroid cartilage has been cut, whether partially or completely and the alhaudegia are saved: then gather the lips of the skin with a suture over the tracheal cartilage, and do not touch the trachea, but rather make it even, and bring it back to its natural shape. ¨
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tie it with a suitable bandage and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments that have astringency and drying properties until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 But if the wound has already affected the bone, then explore it. And if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them or as many as you can. And whatever is not prepared, leave it until the wound becomes putrid and its outlet separates and loosens.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder I mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 However, if bone is visible in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it with that which is mentioned in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 ¶ About the Wound in the Ribs.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter 86
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound from a spear or knife and you see its depth, then consider [the following]:
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If air escapes from the wound when the patient exhales, know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 But if the wound is not deep and is fresh with its own blood, do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood does not collect in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient; but put an attractive ointment on it and loosen it twice a day. )))
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If you do not have ointment at hand, then place an old cloth on the wound's opening so that it absorbs what comes out of it from moisture. And make sure the patient sleeps on the wound so that what accumulates in it is drained away.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 But if three days or more have passed since the wound was inflicted and no spasm occurs to the patient, nor is there a bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see that its other symptoms are good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Care for it with compresses and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 But if its healing is delayed and it continually opens, then know that a fistula has already formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Care for it according to the method described in its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then care for it with that which was previously described under stitching, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 But if the cut has already affected the bone and pieces have fallen out from it, then explore the wound and hasten to remove those pieces if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 But if they are not separated, then leave them alone until the wound becomes foul, for their extraction will be facilitated.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 For the treatment of other wounds occurring on other parts of the body, the judgment is the same as that which we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 ¶ On Wounds of the Abdomen and Exit of Intestines and Their Treatment.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter Eighty-Seven
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 The disruption that occurs in the abdomen is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 Therefore, in the case of a great disruption, sometimes an intestine or a number of intestines emerge. ‌
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 For this reason their insertion and suturing are more vigorous and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 And a small disruption is also made difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore, their reduction will be more difficult if you do not hasten to return them immediately to their place; for it becomes distended, opens up, and swells, making its entrance difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore, a medium-sized disruption is better than other disruptions, because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 You should know that the suture of a vein is according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen and for the suture of other wounds of the body; two other sutures properly belong to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 Nevertheless, they are more proper for the suture of the abdomen; and I will tell you each one with an explanation and demonstration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 I say therefore, that when the wound is small and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it becomes difficult to reduce it; then this is one of two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said; or because there is swelling in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 Therefore, when this is the case, then you should heat it so that you submerge a sponge or a damp cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or boil it in water with hyssop, pepper, and clove, and press the intestine with it until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes it [the wound] produces wine that has astringent properties, and this is better than plain water for resolving the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 Therefore, when you see that the swelling has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow or hollyhock has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For by this its passage is made easy with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If, however, its return is delayed after this treatment, then find the small opening with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than when it is cut; and there is no need to cut after necessity and the lack of an instrument. xspace
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let one part of it be twisted and sharp, and the other part not sharp; and its tip should not be very fine like a Spathamus, but rather somewhat blunt. And this resembles a hook, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When the wound is enlarged and the intestine protrudes, then it must be reduced to its natural shape in its proper place, if possible over it, because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When the disruption is large in the lower part of the belly, then you should make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then put his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And likewise if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then direct your attention and consideration always to this: that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And thus you should do this for large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 But in small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make sure there is a pious assistant present between your hands, who holds the entire disruption with his hand: and join its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then let him who follows the stitching remove something from it, piece by piece: and this is the manner of a common single stitch. ‍
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is that you should take one needle or several needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then leave from the end of the disruption a quantity equal to the ring finger, that is, of the physician; and insert one needle besides what you put into it thread in two ends of the skin, with two ends of the thread that is under the skin from inside until you make it penetrate from the other side, and now you have joined together two ends of the skin, and two ends of the thread: and there are four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then tighten with double thread around the needle several times from both sides together, until the two lips of the wound are joined in a decent union.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then let go of the thickness of the finger and also insert another needle into it; afterwards pull it out with thread as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 And therefore do not cease doing this with what you need from needles until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 And let the needles be of medium thickness between coarseness and fineness, because fine needles very quickly penetrate the flesh and thick ones have a difficult entry into the skin; therefore it is necessary that they be of medium fineness and coarseness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not necessary that the needle be inserted into the two ends of the nearby skin very closely, so that the flesh may not be quickly penetrated and the wound opened before its own healing, and also lengthened with the suture, preventing the wound from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient in his sleep; and place little pads of cloth around all parts of them to hold the ends of the needles; and leave them there until you know that the wound is already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this particular type of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because one needle or two, or about that number, is sufficient for their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 However, the second type of suture is common, that you join with the suture the four ends: two ends of skin and two ends of sinew as one, with a needle on which there is an equally fine and coarse thread wound.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then when you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, bring the needle back from the side where you began, so that the pulled thread falls from the upper part of the wound; let the suture be as the seam of a cloth by which clothes are sewn together, and place between every suture a quantity of the thickness of a smaller finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 This stitching is known to people.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this stitching I healed a wound that had happened to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife, and the tear of the wound was greater than one palm: and about two palms came out from the middle of the intestines, and there was a tear in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 Therefore, I returned it after his intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 Therefore, the wound healed in the space of about fifteen days; and I treated him, and he was cured; and he lived many years after that, converted to his former habits.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the doctors had judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And from a miracle, it was that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor anything from the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 Therefore, I placed an old cloth over the wound twice a day, and I continued to wash it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 But there are two kinds of stitching that I will describe according to the narrative of the language.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is that you should begin with a sharp stitch; and introduce the needle from the outside part towards the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 Therefore, when the needle penetrates into the skin and into the tendon that goes along the length and width of the entire body; leave the end of the thread on the side where you introduced the needle, and make it penetrate from the inner part to the outer part at the other end of the suture. ➤
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you have made it penetrate in this way at that end of the suture from the outer part to the inner part; then make it penetrate likewise at the same end from the outer part to the inner part; and leave the end of the thread, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other end from the inner part to the outer part; and continue to penetrate with your penetration as you make it penetrate into the end of the suture that is in that part, until it penetrates entirely. ➤
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then begin also from this same side, and either the very thing itself along with its tip, which is from the knife in the other side, and extract the needle from the skin that it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then bring it back into that skin, and either the tip of the needle, which is in the other side, with this tip of thread: and extract it from the skin on its part, and do this once and another; and do this once after the other, until its entirety is brought out externally according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 And the end of this stitch is that just as there are stitches for peeling skins which are on skins, so also needles once from one side of the skin tip: and that you leave them once from another side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second kind of stitch which Galen called proper.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This statement has been narrated in such a way that some physicians do this according to the likeness, so that they bring together every part to its suitable companion by nature: and they apply the tip of the needle to its other tip, and the tip of thread to its other tip.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this is done as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is necessary that you drive the needle into the near end of the thread from you on the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner in that only: and leave two tips of needle.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner in the two tips of needle, that is on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both of them and also make both penetrate from the inner to the outer, into the two other ends of thread which are on the opposite side.  \\
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of stitching is better than common easy stitching, and it is the stitch whose mention preceded.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 "This is therefore also the saying of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The stitching of the abdomen should be corrected with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 That is, you introduce one thread into both of them: and begin with the introduction of the needle from what is on your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, following the stitching of those who evenly sew hides.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 However, the judgment of treating a wound is the same as for other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 That is, when you obtain a fresh wound with its own blood before the air alters it, and bring out the intestine, and sew it up, and make it firm, then place powdered kermes on it.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 But if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it certain ointments which you have at hand, until they cause pus: and the threads fall out, and the silk and myrrh are strengthened.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it as is the care of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 But if the medications are not at hand, then place on it immediately from when it begins to emit pus, old cotton: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need another treatment in many cases, when the wounds are simple.  />
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 But if you fear that the wound may communicate with the main members during injury, then it is necessary to soak a soft wool cloth in warm oil or rose oil, and place it around the areas between the groins and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 But if he feels pain or pricking or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then enema him with warm stiptic wine, especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and caused a piercing exitus up to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what is from the large intestine is of easier healing, and what is from them is from the small intestine, more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 And the intestine which is called jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is due to its multitude of veins and their size, and due to the fineness of its body, and the proximity of the nature of the nerves themselves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 But if what comes from the wound is a cord and you find it fresh, reintroduce it according to your usual method of reducing intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if a length of time has passed and it has already turned green or black, then you must tie it with thread over the darkened part to prevent bleeding from happening.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in a cord there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligature and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its traction upon you is alleviated, and the pulling out of it in the case of a cord, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 § Remembering the Wound that Occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When an injury occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible for it to be restored in some men, because I saw a man who was wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound healed, and a fistula formed, and from it came discharge and gas. )))
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore applied treatment until I did not trust in his healing; nor did I cease to examine it closely, until the place was healed and consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw that the place had already healed, I feared for the patient that a similar misfortune would occur in his abdomen; and this misfortune did not happen to him from that time onward.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in his better condition, eating and drinking, having intercourse, entering the bath, and exercising according to his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some of those who perform experiments have said that when there is a wound in the intestine and it is small, then it should be ligated in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And it is necessary to take ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants whose mouths are open on the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 Therefore, when it bites onto them and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will stick, and not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with ants, one after the other, according to the entire extent of the wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then return him, and his wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is healed and there is no further harm to the patient at all.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And it is also possible to ligate the intestine even with a fine thread: that which has been taken out of the intestine of an animal, attached to it after it is inserted into a needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And it is necessary to take the end of this thread from the intestine, and scrape off much of its flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a fine linen thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert that thread into a needle and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then return him to his rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of faith and hope. />
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 You should know that a large and deep wound, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no remedy except to cauterize, and it will not heal at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 On the Care of Zukhemen and Fistulas
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter 88
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 You should know that any wound or abscess when it becomes old and chronic and turns into an ulcer and does not heal and always discharges pus and does not come to a head: then it is called generally in whatever member it may be a Fistula, and we call this Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And indeed a Fistula is in truth a knotty, hard, white, filtered ulcer, with which there is no pain, having the concavity of a bird's feather; and because of this some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And at certain times it is moist, discharging pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And sometimes the moisture may break up at certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And this moisture may be sometimes much and sometimes little; thick sometimes and other times thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already mentioned this in the division, when I said "wounds," that any ulcer which does not heal and in which no flesh is generated, it is only for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of these causes is either because of the scarcity or poor quality of blood in the body; or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips, preventing the birth of new flesh; or because it contains much filth and impurity; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the material sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine used for its treatment is not suitable; or because a falling corruption in the region is pestilential, or because of some property specific to that region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of diseases is difficult and the natural healing of abscesses is delayed; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, within it. ︎
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and the treatments of them with medicines by division; and here it is necessary for me to make you know the treatment of Fistula and Cyst, which is done by the way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Therefore, know that a Fistula can occur in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For of these there are Fistulas which reach the large veins or arteries, or nerves, or spleen; or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs; or to some of the vertebrae of the back, or to some of the compound joints by composition; such as the hand and foot. And there are those which go towards the vicinity of the principal member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Therefore, among these Fistulas, the one of this kind is difficult to cure from illnesses and does not accept treatment, and dealing with it is laborious and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 But if there is any of the Fistulas whose depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned; and you hope and trust in its treatment, and you wish to attain knowledge of it, then take a probe of iron or silver, if the Fistula extends straight, and search it with this.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 But if there is any crookedness in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Because lead, on account of its softness, adapts and curves around the crookedness.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate upon it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Therefore, irrigate one of its openings from its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the moisture by which you irrigate it goes towards other openings and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then carefully investigate how it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is an orifice or a nerve there, and the cavity of the Fistula is distant or near; or whether it is one Fistula which has many openings, and stand over all of it, with your utmost strength, with your questioning of the sick person, and with the discovery of pain upon pressure with your hand on that place, and similar signs and causes happening to an abscess.  />  />
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When you have stood over all those things with true steadiness, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is that at that time you should consider whether there is a visible Fistula nearby or in a safe place far from the joint, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you. Then cut the Fistula as described in my account, and remove what is in it from filtration and corrupted flesh, which comes out of its opening from flesh, pus, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If the Fistula is deep and straight, then you must cut it as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then apply strips wrapped in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the Fistula which you have grasped with the iron; do this several times until the sharp medicine has corroded all that remains in the cavity of the Fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then heal it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 But if it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the Fistula is a bone, and you have ascertained this, then examine it, and cut it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you from the vein, or nerve, or main member, as we said. 
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If the bone is exposed and there is some corruption and blackness on it, then scrape it until all its corruption has been removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then heal it with what causes it to become fleshy until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal and exudes pus as before, then you should know that you have not completely removed all the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Therefore, clean it thoroughly a second time, and carefully make an incision into it, and cleanse it with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, that is good; but if not, then know that the corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 You have no skill in that, unless you leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 But if the wound is small and possible for you, attract it with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 But if there are many bones, then carefully attract all of them, and do not leave any out with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 But if anything resists you because of moisture and there is no fear or danger in cutting it, then cut the moistures and flesh if they are there and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then place on the wound something that will cause it to putrefy; and leave it until what is around those bones of flesh and moistures has putrefied.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And watch the wound so that it does not become healed.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And let the incision you have made in your procedure be tightened.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Put on it, if you wish, a cloth soaked in ground sulfur mixed with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any of the green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those moistures have putrefied and the bones are separated from them, their removal and attraction is facilitated.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 But if the wound is one large wound, such as a thigh or hip wound and the like, and if what has become corrupted from it is a large part, then scrape it with the utmost care until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then heal the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If however the corruption is in it and the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw through the bone and cut it entirely up to the place where the corruption reaches; then heal it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you about a ulcer that happened to a man on his leg; so that you can use it as an example and assistance for your procedure.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a young man about thirty years old to whom pain occurred in his leg, from a cause that moved within him inside the body, that is, from internal causes, until the material reached the leg and formed a large swelling: and there was no external cause for this.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Therefore, time passed with him in error by the physicians, until the swelling was opened and many materials flowed out with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And his treatment was neglected until the leg formed a fistula and many openings were made in it; all of which discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one among them skilled in the art of surgery, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the materials that flowed from those openings in large quantities; even the entire body of the man had already become emaciated, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings of the places, and the probe reached the bone.  (lit.: "and the probe came to the mouth")
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings and found that they communicated with each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I hurried therefore and cut over one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone; and I found it corrupted, which was already eaten away and blackened, and putrid, and perforated until it reached the marrow.  (lit.: "until it had penetrated up to the marrow")  ()
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I have discovered and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I determined that there was nothing in the bone except for that corruption which I cut out and sawed off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I have already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I applied a restoration to the wound with medicines that promote healing for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it has not healed.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again and uncovered the bone a second time above the first exposure, and I found a continuous corruption with the bone, and I sawed off what appeared to me from that corruption as well.  />
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I attempted to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Therefore I uncovered it again and did not stop cutting the bone into pieces and trying to restore it, and it was not restored, until I had cut off about one hand's breadth of bone with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I restored it with medicines and it healed quickly and was cured. And this repetition of the operation and cutting of it would not have been necessary, except for the condition of the patient's weakness and his small capacity to endure, and my fear for him of death, because he fainted from the excess of the evacuation at every hour with great difficulty.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Therefore he was cured with a complete healing: and in the place of the bone, hard flesh grew, and a good constitution developed in his body, and his strength returned: and he returned to his usual habits, and it did not cause him any harm at all in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 But if the bone protrudes from a place that was already fractured, then you should saw it off in this manner: and that is, take a bandage and tie it around the end of the protruding bone, and command someone to pull it upwards, and put another bandage of thicker wool underneath the first bandage.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then tie it on the flesh that is above the bone, and extend its end to draw the flesh downwards, so that you expose the flesh over the place you wish to saw, lest the saw injure the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a stick or board under the bone below in an orderly manner, because when you do that, it will not prevent the sawing of the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And it is necessary that the sawing be done on the corrupted place for a short while, so that corruption does not befall the concavity of the bone; and so that it does not become apparent to the senses in its appearance, compelling another part to be sawed instead.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, but rather one of its parts is connected to another part, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part of it, then expose all the flesh from every part completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place a stick below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing continues to the other side; and let the sawing be according to the length of the corruption for a short while, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 But if the corruption is at a joint, cut the corrupted joint and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if the corruption is at a continuation of two joints, then there is no skill required except scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 But if the corruption is in the comb of the hand or the comb of the foot, then the matter in it is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 Truly, you must examine how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And scrape it and clean it in whatever way is possible for you and with whatever skill you can manage, when a vein or nerve does not stand in your way.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that there are many instruments and saws for cutting these bones according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness or thinness, their size or smallness, their hardness or softness. 》
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, you should prepare an appropriate tool for each type of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations indicate to you the form of the tool you need when your study is prolonged.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And the knowledge of the methods of this art is evidence of the methods of illnesses, for then you will find through yourself that which is suitable for each from the tools for every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I confirm to you at the end of this chapter the number of tools, which you will set as examples on which you will operate, and the test by which you will experiment on others. 》

Forma alterius Serrae.	 The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The shape of yet another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This form of the saw is depicted, let it be made elegantly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Its handle should be curved, its edge made of iron, and its grip from boxwood, let it be elegantly made in a pyramidal shape.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 The form of the scissors for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 Let the head of this scissors be according to the form of the head of a star-shaped nail, and its points according to the form of the points of a spindle whorl.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And it is not suitable except for when the heads of joints are rubbed with it, when they become corrupt or when the mouth is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 The form of the larger scissors. 》
Forma medii Rasorii.	 The shape of the medium scissors.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 The shape of the broad scissors.

Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 The shape of another curved-tipped scissors.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 The shape of a small and fine-pointed pair of scissors.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 The form of the scissors with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also, the form and that of a large pair of scissors.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This resembles a rib, and its end is like a saw: it appears in many places due to the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 The shape of the scalpel fits the nature of what has been penetrated by the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its end is triangular and sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	 It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And likewise, all that we have said must be made from scalpels, incisors, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 ¶ On the incision of limbs and sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Limbs become putrid either due to an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 When you have treated that corruption with medical treatment and it does not help, and you see the corruption spreading to the limb without any cause; then you must incise that limb up to where the corruption reaches, so that the patient may be saved from death or from a greater defect of the limb.  />
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign of this is that the limb becomes blackened until it stinks; whether fire has burned it or it has become putrid after the blackening. Until that putrefaction reaches what follows the limb and spreads throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Therefore hasten with its incision, and likewise if the cause of the corruption is from the bite of some venomous things, such as a sea-scorpion, viper, asp, or similar.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If the corruption or bite is on the tip of a finger, then cut off the finger and do not leave any space for the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And likewise if it occurs on the hand, then cut it off from the root of the wrist, and do not leave any space for the corruption to spread until it reaches the wrist.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it invades that part, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If corruption passes through and you see it about a foot long: then in that is the death of the sick person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And to administer beyond that from treatment is the quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And likewise do for the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 But if it rises to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 And if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill [to save it], except dismissal and leaving the patient to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the way of cutting off a limb or sawing it is to tie a ligature below where you wish to cut: and tie another ligature above that place. 》 》 》
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And let the assistant stretch one ligature downwards; and let the other assistant stretch the upper ligature upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures with a wide spatula until all the flesh is laid bare. 》 》 》 》 》 》
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then let it be cut or sawed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth from all sides so that the saw does not touch the healthy place; and a secondary injury may occur to the patient, and a hot abscess [may form].
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 But if bleeding occurs inside while you work, then quickly cauterize the place; or put on it certain powders that cut off the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until it is complete. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligature and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happened to a man on his foot, this same thing that I am telling you about. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 What this means is: "This is because a blackening occurred in his foot due to the burning that resembles fire's burning; and that corruption first affected his toe until it began to affect the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore, the man cut himself after he saw that the corruption had fallen on his member with great force, which he felt through pain and burning; and it fell upon him at the joint, and he was cured.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time had passed, that same corruption occurred in his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 So he came to me, and I tried to cure that excess with what I applied on his hand from medicines after cleansing his body; and the excess did not go away, but began to spread into another finger until the corruption affected the whole hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 He then called for me to cut off his hand; and I refused, hoping that from me the excess would be cured; and I also feared that he might die if his hand were amputated.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the man's strength was greater than his condition.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 After he lost hope in me, he returned to his homeland; and I heard from him that he cut off his hand entirely; and he was cured.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I have not told this story except to be of help for what falls under this type of illness; and that it may be understood and acted upon accordingly.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 § On the Treatment of Gout and the Preparation of Purgatives with Medicines.
Caput XC.	 Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus; then it bursts or is perforated, and what is in it exits with the pus, and there remains a hollow place as if it were a vessel; and the skin above it is like a thin cloth that has been worn away: and the corruption does not reach its end, nor does it press into a bone, nor into a nerve, nor into a ligament; then it deserves to be called Sinus; and it is not called Fistula. However, if its space is prolonged until it presses into one of these members, then it is called Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And its treatment is to cut the skin completely as it rolls: and especially when it has been made thin, and turned into cloth: and you can be confident that it will not adhere to the place, due to its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 But if you hope that the skin will adhere and that this final corruption does not follow: and if there is thickness in the flesh of the skin, then treat it with an enema: and consider it towards the cavity.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor: then enema it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and quicklime, the parts being equal, combined in a vessel: and boil them over fire until the medicine turns red: and reaches the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take as much of it as you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the cavity with it: and close its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the space of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then withdraw it with an expression: do this every day until the cavity is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And sometimes it should be enemaed with water of ashes, when this medicine is not available to you: and it is that you take ashes from grapevine wood or ashes from holm oak wood: and pour water over them.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then strain it, and enema with it until you are confident that the cavity has been washed out.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then enema it with water and honey, in which some crushed quicklime has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or enema it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey, which cleanses and washes: and wine makes the cavity adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you do that several times and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has been removed, then irrigate it with what makes flesh grow therein.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is necessary to take some of the plaster called diafinicon; dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine; or irrigate it with certain medicines and other ointments whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 But if the orifice of the sinus is narrow and does not accept the cannula for irrigation, then briefly enlarge it with an iron instrument; or place in it a wick wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicum ointment, until it is dilated.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if the orifice is also wide, then gather its lips with a stitch; and let out from it the quantity that can enter without increasing the irrigation.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if the orifice from which the pus flows is raised higher; then cut it in a lower place within it, so that the pus may flow downward; for when the pus is constricted in the depths of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing therein.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus lower as you wish; then try to prepare the member with a preparation that allows the pus to flow easily, according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try that nothing at all from the pus is retained therein; and take healing ointments which are placed on the sign, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the cloth be of such quantity that it covers the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors a hole directly into the orifice of the sinus, slightly larger than the orifice of the sinus itself.  />
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread over another cloth some of the soft ointments according to the size of the hole; and place it on top with a long-lasting position far from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be alleviated; and do not remove the large cloth except after several days, once a day.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 But the one that is over the opening of the sinus is the one you remove every hour so that what accumulates in it may exit; and so you may know whether that which runs out of it is much or little: or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And with this, again consider the location of its sinus, whether its master feels pain there or whether there is no pain there and whether it has a swelling there or does not have a swelling there.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 Therefore, when your treatment is extended in this manner and you see the matter that comes out over the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus is already adhering or approaching adhesion; therefore release it in the morning or on the third day. And when you release the wound, then change another cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 But if after a long time a thin pus comes out of the sinus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching; since among men there are some who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds and there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 But if after many days undigested pus comes out of the sinus, then know that the sinus is not adhering.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its process is prolonged; then in drying medicines, let the doctors make them so that they are humid in their substance and dry in their power; such as the ointment dyafinicon, when a superabundance of zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the last chapter to be cured is this: take diaphanic ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, then sprinkle on it ancient wine equal in substance to itself.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now make something similar to this procedure when you do not have diaphanic ointment: take honey and cook it until it thickens, then use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense: grind all of them together and sprinkle the powder over honey while it is on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then spread it on a cloth and tie it over the ulcer; and smear it with the honey you cooked until it thickens; and sprinkle powdered spices on it, and place another cloth over it, and tie it on.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes it is given in that long-stemmed birthwort, and the root of celestial lily, which is lily; and flour of herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them either simply or compounded; grind them and sift them; and sprinkle the powder on the honey I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 But if the ulcer is prolonged and not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption at its depth; or it has already made an impression on the bones, or other hard parts of the body, or ligaments; then cure it with the treatment for fistulas as was previously mentioned.

Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Whitlow is an abscess that arises under the thumbnail of the hand or foot, and perhaps it may arise in other fingers as well.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 So when its condition is prolonged and its care is neglected, it becomes an abscess with hot inflammation; or it becomes corrupt and emits pus until it erodes the root of the nail; and perhaps the corruption affects the whole nail; and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone so that there is a foul odor; and the end of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark. 》
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When therefore you cure it with what we have said in division, and your treatment does not help, then you should cut off with a knife all the remaining overgrowth from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 For cautery is very healing.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 But if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, and the nail's additions are already pressing into the flesh within, and they begin to sting it and harm it: then you should place a thin wire under the corner of the nail that is stinging the flesh, and push it upward; and cut off that part of the flesh with ease, and put on what remains of the flesh from medicines that burn and corrode until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 But if the corruption has already penetrated into the bone, then you must cut out that bone and remove it; for it will never heal as long as there is a corrupted bone within it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 But if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading into the finger, then cut it off at one of its joints, as was previously mentioned for its remembrance.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 But if there is injury or bruising of the nail and it causes intense pain, then you should bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail with a sharp blade across its width from top to bottom as needed.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for by doing so you will cause intense pain to the patient and it will lead to the addition of new flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then treat the area with something that eases the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 But an additional finger that is born in the hands of some people is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps a nail grows on it; and sometimes its birth occurs at the root of a joint, or it is born in some of the finger's joints. ">
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 That which is born at certain nodes of the finger does not move; and that which is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 Therefore, the incision of that which comes from it is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 Which is, as you cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 However, the treatment of that whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from incising it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 But in that which is born in the finger at the last of the nodes, then you should cut its flesh with a round incision to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those saws that fits it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 However, the stiffening that occurs between fingers often happens either from birth, that is, it is born with it, or from the stiffening of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut away that stiffness until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place between them bandages or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly stiffen again, and separate them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the place consolidates as it should be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if stiffness occurs between some fingers with the palm, then cut away that stiffness according to how it is prepared and appropriate for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 ¶ On the Incision of Birthmarks.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Birthmarks are swollen, thick veins filled with melancholic humors that occur in many parts of the body; and their outcome is most common in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, workers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 You should therefore administer purging of the body with black bile frequently and strongly.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then perform bloodletting on the patient from a basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 However, their treatment with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of them is that they are cut and black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And the other method is that a vein is elevated and the entire thing is drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 Its cutting is according to this manner.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 Soak the leg first with very warm water until the thick, muddy blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of their thigh to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three, with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then elevate, that is, draw the blood into your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and first the phlebotomist should bleed the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the nail along with the lower part until an amount of blood that you see is sufficient and that the strength of the patient can bear comes out.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Afterwards bind it, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile, and repeat evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are filled and it harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 Its elevation is according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Shave the patient's leg if it has many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then place the patient in a bath, or soak the leg in hot water until it turns red and the veins become engorged, or have them exercise strongly if there is no available bath, until the limb becomes warm.  />
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then cut the skin along the length of the vein's incision, or at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein from every part until it becomes perceptible to the senses; and at its appearance you see that it turns red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it comes out of the skin, you see that it is white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then introduce under it a rod, until when it is lifted and comes out of the skin; suspend it with a blind hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then cut another incision near that incision by three fingers' breadth.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then strip the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then lift it with rods as you did before, and suspend it with another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then cut another incision, or more incisions, if you need that.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then lift it and cut the last incision at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then pull it out to the incision that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you pull it out of the higher incision, or all the incisions, until it comes out completely; then cut it off.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 But if it does not obey you in being pulled out and lifted; then introduce a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod under it: and turn your hand to every part until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And beware that it is not cut.  /> If you can't extract the vein as described above, use a strong needle with double thread and tie it around the vein. Then pull it out gently. Alternatively, insert a rod under the vein and turn your hand in all directions until the vein comes out completely. Be careful not to cut the vein during this process.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it will be very difficult for you to lift it up, and a great harm will come upon the patient from that.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when you have pulled it out completely; then place on the wound site a wool cloth soaked in rose oil or oil; and care for him until he is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the tendon is contracted and has a twist such that it winds around parts, and is not straight as we said before: then you should cut through it at every point of its twist and places of its winding.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then suspend it with hooks until you raise the whole thing: and be careful not to cut a vein or cause injury at your cut, for it will be difficult for you to raise or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Therefore, be wise.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The Shape of the Incision by Which a Tendon is Treated.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The Shape of the Blind Stitch.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It does not have a curve like the other stitches, nor does it have an acute tip so as not to injure a vein; and it is of thick, flexible material, gentle: because if it were thin, it would cut through the vein with its thinness; rather, let there be some excess thickness in it, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the Extraction of a Vein from the Leg.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is found in the legs in hot countries, such as Alsace and the Arab lands, and in dry, hot countries of little fertility, that is, where neither grass nor trees grow.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it occurs in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 And its generation is from the corruption that occurs under the skin, just like the corruption that occurs within the body with snakes and roundworms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a severe swelling occurs in the leg.  />
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then the place becomes blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the vein begins to come out from that place of blistering, like a root of a plant or an animal.  />  />
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 Therefore, when its end appears, then you should wrap a piece of lead around it, weighing from one and a half drams to two and a quarter drams, and tie it; and let the hanging lead be suspended from the leg.  />
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something comes out from it to the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it off.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it is extended greatly, then cut off a part of it, and wrap up the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut it off completely until it has come out entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 For if you cut it, it contracts and goes into the flesh, causing an abscess and rotting in that place, and a bad sore.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it is necessary that it be gently handled and drawn out little by little until it comes out completely from its end, and nothing remains of it in the body; and this vein, in some people, comes out to a length of five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has come to me because it came out of a man from twenty palms.  />
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 But if it is cut during your treatment, then insert a rod through its opening and pierce it with a long hole, along with the body, until everything that is in it from matter is evacuated; and apply rotting of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then treat him with the care for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself; and many openings occur on it, and a branch comes out from each opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore treat it as we said in the division, and with what was stated before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 ¶ On the cutting of worms generated under the skin, which is called the disease of cows.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is named in a certain land among us the cow's disease, because it often happens to cows, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.  />  />
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it goes through the whole body, ascending and descending; and it is perceived by sense during its motion from member to member, until it bursts into whatever place it bursts on the skin and comes out.  />  />  />
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 "And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 "Just as worms and snakes, that is, leeches and roundworms, occur in the stomach.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 "And it is feared because of its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 "Because when it moves through the body and is raised to the head and reaches that place, then perhaps it opens there and exits, destroying the eye; and this often happens.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 "Therefore, when you wish to cure it and remove it, this can only be done during its movement and appearance to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 "It is therefore necessary that you tie what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 "Then cut above it and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 "But if it has penetrated deeply into the flesh and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire on the spot until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 "And what is more to be feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 "But if you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then tie a good ligature around the eyebrow below it.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 "Then cut above it and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 "And the patient should use purification of his body with medicines that dissolve bad, putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 "And he should avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 "Concerning the incision for Nakir's disease.
Caput XCV.	 "Chapter 95
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 "This illness is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain members; then it changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 "And I myself have already seen it, as I am now telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 "I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 "And she revealed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the cord of the arm vein." ‌
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after one hour had passed, I saw a swelling advancing with a torch, just like a worm, ascending to his shoulder more quickly than it possibly could be: as if it were living silver, running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 Therefore the pain retreated from that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then I waited one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then he told me that it was revolving throughout his whole body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 Therefore I marveled at the speed of its change from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed, before that, I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 However, I have seen many who find pain changing from member to member; and I did not see it with my own eyes as I saw it in the woman. 》
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that is so unless it is because the woman was one of those who are from dry-bodied people with exposed veins; therefore it appears to the senses that the gaseousness has been changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 When therefore you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain, then if it is appearing to your eye as we have said, then bind swiftly above it and below it; and cut above it until the gaseousness emerges constricted; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If however you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat him with a body purge and with that which expels gaseousness, and mixes them with foul pills and pills of celery seed and the like.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 On the Extraction of Arrows
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are distinguished by their various types and the places where they strike the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 For there is a diversity among them, since some have large tips and others small ones; some are hollow, and others blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And among them are those that have three points.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And among them are those with tongues (barbs). )))
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And among them are those with stars (fletchings).
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 But those that fall according to the members where they strike are of two kinds. )))
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 For the members are either from the main hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestines, bladder, and similar ones. ))) )))) )))
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When, therefore, it falls into one of these organs and the signs of death, which I will tell you about later, appear to you, then you must avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows the person in whom it is found in many cases.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 But when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not hidden deep within the organ, then extract it and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and pierces through the bone and exits above the brain are: because a severe headache occurs from it, along with blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile. ))) ))) ))))))
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood may exit from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed. )))
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And from the place of the wound a white moisture like boiled starch exits. ))) )))
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And it comes out of it resembling wateriness of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left nipple and the person feels with it as if it were fixed in a hard substance, not an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps there is a movement of the arrow similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And it is followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting spells.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Know therefore that death has certainly come.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And the sign of an arrow that has wounded the lung is the issuing of frothy blood from the wound; and the veins that follow the neck swell up, and the color of the patient changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And he breathes out a large, deep breath, and seeks cold air to breathe in.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the diaphragm, which is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great panting with intense pain, along with sighing; and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out of the wound with it.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 And if the arrow falls into the belly and is fixed there, then something comes out of the wound - either feces, or a piece of intestine that has already been torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 There is therefore no hope in treating it or in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out, and something protrudes to the outside, and the pain is stronger upon the patient, then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and arm, and scapula of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are healed in many ways when the arrow does not find an artery or a nerve; and the arrow is not poisoned.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you that I have seen these arrows, so that you may indicate through it the treatment for yourself.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 What happened was that a certain man had an arrow strike his tear duct at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 So I removed it from the other side, from under his ear's fat: and he was cured, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I removed another arrow from a Jew that had struck him under his lower eyelid in the eye's fat: and the arrow was already hidden, and I only got out of it a small part of its end, to which its wood adhered: and the arrow was large for Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no barbs.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 So the Jew was cured, and no misfortune befell his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I removed another arrow from a Christian's throat.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And it was an Arabic arrow, and that is the kind with barbs.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 So I cut above it between two guides [muscles]: and it was already sunk into his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 So I made myself fine with it, until I removed it: and the Christian was cured.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I removed another arrow from a man that had struck him in his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed and nothing about his condition changed, I cut above the arrow: and I inserted a probe into it, and I removed it: and he was cured, and no misfortune befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had struck, and the wound over it had healed.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years had passed, the arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman into whose belly an arrow had struck, and the wound over it had healed, and the arrow remained within her: and nothing about her condition changed, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 I saw another man who had an arrow fall into his face; the wound became healed and remained, causing him little pain. And there were many similar cases like these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 I removed an arrow from a man who was one of the King's nobles; it had fallen into his nose and had already deviated slightly to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 Therefore I was called for his treatment after the fall of the arrow until three days later.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 I found that the wound from the arrow was very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 I sought to examine it with a fine probe, but did not feel anything; and he himself felt the puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 Therefore I hoped that the puncture was from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I plastered the place with a plaster that had attracting and digestive power, confident in myself that the spot would swell up and give me a sign of the arrow so that I could cut over it; but nothing happened in the place indicating that the arrow had reached there.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 Therefore I continued to plaster it with a plaster for many days; and no sign appeared, but the wound became healed in the meantime. And he remained weak from its extraction for some time until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 I placed a sharp, caustic medicine on that wound for many days until it opened up; and with a fine probe I probed it, and felt the tip of the arrow which was attached to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly; and for me, a period of about four months had passed with him.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 After the wound had become enlarged and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, but it did not comply with coming out; then I did not stop seeking ways and contrivances over it until one day I began on it with well-made forceps, as will appear in their form at the end of this chapter, until I removed it. "> Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed physicians judge that the nasal cartilage cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 Therefore I restored it [the nasal cartilage], and the wound was healed, and the patient was cured with perfect health; nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the method of extracting certain arrowheads, so that you may take this as a rule and interpretation for what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Since the parts of this art and their divisions are not included with the narration; nor does the book contain them, and a skilled craftsman compares what is present to what is absent, and finds a new operation and a new instrument for unusual occurrences in this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore that arrows do not come out of the members to which they are fixed except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Either by pulling from the place through which it entered.  />
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or by cutting through the opposite side of the limb.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which comes out from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and is pulled out, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 But if it does not submit to coming out from the hour in which it fell, then you must leave it alone for several days until the flesh surrounding it putrefies; and its removal is relaxed and its exit facilitated.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly, if it is fixed in a bone and does not submit to coming out, then leave it alone also for several days; and continue to pull on it with every movement every day until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 But if it does not submit to coming out after several days, then you must bore around the arrow in the bone from every side with a fine awl until the arrow is enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then pull on it and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already penetrated one of the cavities of the brain, and some of those symptoms which I mentioned appear in the patient: then abstain from pulling out the arrow, and leave it there until its condition stabilizes after a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if an arrow reaches the spinal cord, then death is not delayed for that person.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed except in the bone itself and does not penetrate to the spinal cord, and the patient remains for some days, and none of those symptoms occur to him: then use skill in extracting the arrow.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 But if it is fixed very firmly and does not yield to extraction: then apply trephines around the arrow, as I have told you: then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 But if the arrow is already hidden in the body and concealed from sense: then seek it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 But if you feel it, then extract it with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 But if you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow in depth, and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge the wound over it, until the wound is widened and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 But if there are any barbs with which it is held, then free the attached flesh from all sides by every means you can, and use ingenuity, if it cannot be pulled out because of the tearing of the flesh in the fracture and twisting of the bones, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And you, when you administer the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps in all parts, until you make it come out: and act subtly at last with great subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and the extraction of itself becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot heal it within one hour, then leave it for a few days until what is around it rots.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then revisit it: for the skin will be relieved. But if you experience a flow of blood, then administer what was said about treatment in its chapter: and guard your strength from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer skill in every way possible for the arrow's escape: and let it be with ease, tranquility, slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And it is necessary that when you pull the arrow, you make it weak according to the shape as it was at the time of the arrow's entry into the body.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because this is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 If the arrow comes out from the opposite side or if something already protrudes to the outside, or if the tip of the arrow causes a swelling that you can feel through the skin above it and you see it protruding, then cut over it, and let the incision be as wide as forceps can grasp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then pull it out, for it becomes easy to exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 But if it is stuck in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow impresses itself into the bone and enlarges its own passage; then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: leave it for a few days; then revisit it until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the arrowhead is wooden, then push it through with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 But if the wooden part has broken off and you wish to administer a push: then introduce into it a concave instrument so that its concavity fits into the arrow's shaft; then push it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If however the arrowhead is concave, then push it with an entering tool into itself.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The arrow is relieved by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out all of the flesh in which there is venom: if you are able to do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then treat it with what is appropriate for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 But if the arrow falls into the chest or belly or bladder or side, and it is close to that which you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then stitch the wound if you see it and treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the shape of forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The ends should be like the beak of a bird, made of iron, and when they grasp onto the arrowhead, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And from them many forms are made: large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and slenderness of the arrow, and the width and depth of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of a concave pusher.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the shape of a deaf pusher.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is the end like a radius, so that its entrance into the concave arrowhead may be relieved and pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of the concave pusher is concave like a bird's feather, so that the arrowhead’s entrance into it and its thrust may be relieved.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 ¶ On bloodletting of veins.
Caput XCVII.	 Chapter 97.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 There are thirty veins that are commonly used for bloodletting in the body.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	 Of which there are sixteen in the head: two pulsating veins that are behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries that appear in both temples; and two veins that are in both tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the "watchers"; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the tip of the nose. />
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	 And the two jugular veins that are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	 And the two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	 And the two veins that are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	 And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	 And the two veins that are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	 But the veins which are bled in the arms are five in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 One of them is the cephalic, and it is from the side of the woods; and the common people name it the vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	 And the dark one.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	 And it is the median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic; and the common people name it the vein of the body. 》 》 》 》
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	 And the basilic, and it is placed on the domestic side; and it is also named the tickler.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	 And the common people name it the vein of the belly.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	 And the tendon of the arm, and it is placed on top of the faucet; and that is the one which is bled, and it is that which appears above the thumb in a clear manner.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	 And the little savior; and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the smallest one; and there are two branches to it.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	 And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	 One of them is that which is under the curvature of the thumb on the side of the woods. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	 And the second one is the saphenous; and its place is near the heel on the domestic side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 And the vein called nessis; and its place is by the heel on the side of the woods.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	 And in the other part of the leg there are three similar veins. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 ¶ On the bleeding of the two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 Cutting the two veins behind the ears is beneficial for old catarrhs, migraines, scabies, and old sores of the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the manner of bleeding it is as I relate:
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 And it is done by shaving the head of the patient, and rubbing his occiput where the two veins are with a rough cloth until well rubbed.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then let the patient tie their neck with a band, until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 And their locations are behind the ears, in two depressed areas of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark there with a cautery.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take the phlebotomy knife, which is called an incision knife.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 Then insert it under the vein into the skin, until the phlebotomist reaches the mouth of the vein.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin using an incising cut.  And let the blood flow from the vein until it flows of its own accord.  Then take a cotton bandage and bind the wound well with it, so that no air may reach the wound.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 And let the length of the incision be about the size of two joined fingers, or thereabouts; and let out as much blood as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 Then bind it with wool bandages, and leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	 And now, at the beginning of this chapter, there was described their incision and cauterization.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 ¶ On the bleeding of the two arteries in the temples.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 The bleeding of the two arteries which are in the temples is beneficial for old migraines, crooked squinting, chronic blepharitis, and the flow of sharp excess fluids to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the manner of bleeding them is as I shall tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 The patient should tighten his neck greatly until two veins become clearly visible to the touch and their pulse is felt under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then mark those signs with cautery.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then lift the skin above the vein with your index finger and introduce the lancet underneath it, lifting the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 Cut it as you did with the two other veins, and let the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then release the patient's constriction and place your finger over the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then place a bandage and some wool over it, and tie it firmly with a constriction: leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	 And now, the mention of them, their cutting, and their extraction has preceded at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 § On bleeding the temporal vein after cephalic bloodletting.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 The benefit of bleeding the temporal vein is after cephalic bloodletting for old facial diseases, and for migraine and redness, and foul ulcers. ›
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And its quality of bloodletting is as I tell you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 The patient should constrict his neck with a cord until the vein appears. › ›
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take the instrument called a scoop. › ›
Cuius haec est forma.	 Whose form is this.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place the pointed tip of the scoop over the vein and strike it with a comb or something similar to it; allow the blood to flow according to your will.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then release the patient's constriction and tie it firmly until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it is opened with a wide lancet.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it should not be a sharp-pointed lancet like the others; rather, it should have a broad point. › › ›
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And with bloodletting she is according to transfusion, because the mouth is nearby; and perhaps the bloodletter will break there when it is delicate.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 About Bloodletting of Veins at Both Lacrimal Orifices.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 The treatment of the two veins that are in both lacrimal orifices is for the eye due to scabies and redness, and for inflammation in the eye, and diseases of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 And the quality of bloodletting them is that the patient should tie their neck with a bandage.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then bleed them, and you should be standing over their head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 And let the bloodletting be along the length of a little, with a small bloodletter, somewhat wide, for there is no flesh in that place. 
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 For if the bloodletter is delicate at the tip, perhaps it will break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then let as much blood flow out as you need.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 And place a poultice over them and bind them for one night, and then remove it.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 About Bloodletting of the Veins of the Nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 The bloodletting of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and severe headache, and diseases of the face, such as migraine and redness that occurs on the face; especially when it is chronic.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 And the quality of this bloodletting is that the patient should tie their neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long bloodletter, and insert it into the middle of the nostril itself, between what divides the nose lengthwise. ¨
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Because the vein is not apparent there by touch, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it is necessary that you should remove your hand with the bloodletter a little and let as much blood flow out as you need. ¨ ¨ ¨ ¨ ¨ ¨ ¨
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then tie it up for one night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it is quickly restored.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 § On the venesection of the veins, according to Guidi.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 But Guidi's two venesections are beneficial for treating shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, melancholic illnesses, impetigo and severe ulcers, and gnawing pains, that is, herpes zoster.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the method of these venesections is that the patient should draw tight under both armpits with a ligature; and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then make a small incision in the vein to the length of a wide venesection.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then draw out a measured amount of blood, or as much as is necessary for that purpose.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do the same with the other vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Then loosen the ligature and tie both veins tightly in the middle, so that the patient is not suffocated. 
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And leave it like this until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 For the wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 § On the venesection of the veins, according to al-Zahrawi.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 Al-Zahrawi's venesections are beneficial for treating mouth sores and rotten gums, severe ulcers and lip fissures, as well as those in the nose and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the method of these venesections is that you should make the patient sit before you and bind their neck with a cord.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then turn the patient's lip inside out and look for the two veins, one of which is on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, and both are distinguishable by their dark color.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 This is true, because around them there are small, black veins.  
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Cut both with intersecting cuts.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 But if you are in doubt and do not know which one it is: then make an incision into the larger and more prominent of the two.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And do the same with the two veins that are in the upper lip; for usually it runs with that one, and make an incision into the two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 On venesection: The vein under the tongue after a venesection of the cephalic vein.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 The venesection of the two veins under the tongue is beneficial because the cephalic venesection is for afflictions of the throat, sore throat, and mouth diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the method of venesection is as follows: let the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; lift up his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for another vein; and both will be dark in color.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Venesection them both; and take care not to finish too quickly when venesecting them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For there are arteries beneath it, and possibly a hemorrhage might occur from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 On the three veins in the elbow. ¶
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are venesected in the elbow run with custom in all people. ¶ ・
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And their venesection is done in two ways. ・ ・ ・
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Either by pricking with a broad myrtle venesection needle, or with an olive wood needle sharpened to a point, or by cutting with a venesection knife, which is called al-nasil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form:
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 It is like this, suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from them are wide and thin varieties according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle venesection needle should be broad, as you see. ・
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it is suitable for opening hollow veins, full, protruding, visible, large, and those which contain thick, cloudy blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this phlebotomy is of lesser width and more delicate in its ends.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it is suitable for phlebotomy of fine veins that contain fine yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 About the phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 However, the basilic is one of these three veins whose phlebotomy is beneficial.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it draws blood from the illnesses that are under the throat and neck, since it follows the chest and abdomen: and it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be careful when phlebotomizing her, because under her there is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If therefore he errs and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore it is necessary not to phlebotomize her with the phlebotomy needle; rather let him cut with a lancet.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the basilic does not appear with a manifest appearance, then it is necessary to divert her and change to another [vein], or seek some branch of her; or in place of her phlebotomy, the vein of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 For she is manifest, and cut her with the lancet phlebotomy, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If you wish to perform the phlebotomy of that same [vein], then it is necessary before constriction of the arm, so that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the place with a cautery, afterwards bind the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the lancet phlebotomy, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And beware that the blow does not fall through the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 When you see, as you tie the bandage, swelling in the place that you marked with a cautery iron, then that swelling is artery swelling: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood spurt like a boy's urine, and it is thin and red, then know that it comes from the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then hasten and place your finger on it for a long time, and then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If the blood is cut off (for often it is cut off), then bind the arm and leave it, and let the patient beware of moving it; and let him be very cautious about it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And he should not move it for several days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 But if the blood does not stop and overcomes you, and there is no medicine at hand, then cut the artery if it appears to you.  /> Et ligabis eam cum digito: et adiunges super ipsum cataplasma, quae est ex pane farinaceo.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its ends are contracted and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree and grind it; take one half and bind it over the place of the vein with a suitable bandage, along with threads and small pieces of cloth until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if the blood is cut off, that's good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if not, then care for it with the same method mentioned before regarding the dust that cuts off the flow of blood; and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in most cases because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of binding it from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 On Venesection of the Dark Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The venesection of the dark vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that he be above fear of bleeding from her, because under that is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 Therefore if he adds to the puncture of the bloodletting and finds a nerve, it causes numbness in her, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps she does not heal at all.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 But if it is hidden in certain people and is subtle and does not show itself, then you should place your bloodletting where you bleed her, with a section by the Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with all your might.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 But if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 ¶ Concerning the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 But the benefit of bleeding the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps with eye diseases. ↑ Return to text
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And it is necessary in this vein, if you wish, that you bleed her by pricking with the olive phlebotomy needle or with the myrtle phlebotomy needle, because it is safer than all the other veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor a nerve. ↑ Return to text
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 However, it is fitting for you during the bloodletting that you avoid with the phlebotomy needle only the head of the biceps, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm her if she is not found on the first blow, but rather it is repeated over her several times with the phlebotomy. ↑ Return to text ↑ Return to text
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 However, perhaps it swells in certain people when she is not found on the first blow, but that swelling does not harm her at all. ↑ Return to text ↑ Return to text
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 ¶ Concerning the usefulness of bloodletting and the precautions that must be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The quality of bloodletting and its effects are what you should consider in order to correct them.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 The first thing you should know is that bloodletting should only be administered for the preservation of health and to maintain its continuance, and as a precaution against the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And for bloodletting to be done in one of the three veins located at the elbow: the cephalic, the dark, and the basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And bloodletting should be done at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in summer and autumn also on an empty stomach; but in winter after eating, when there are signs of fullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 And let bloodletting be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since dawn.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 However, bloodletting administered for illnesses does not have a fixed time; rather, it should be done whenever the circumstances and necessity dictate, whether at night or day, and at any hour and season.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 Nor should a pregnant woman be bled except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Nor should the elderly, who have already passed sixty years of age, be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the bloodletting with a gentle enema, if there is a large amount of retained feces; so that during the bloodletting, the veins do not draw in putrid waste from the intestines which can harm the principal organs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 Nor should a patient who is feeling nauseous or intoxicated be bled, nor someone who is hungover, until these conditions are removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 Nor should a patient with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 And bloodletting should be avoided again after suffering from colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, labor, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, and anything else that weakens the body or spirit.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that; if the blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if it is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prevents him; or he should be exercised in some manner, so that the blood may be refined.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place his phlebotomy on the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said; and strive that his chest be evacuated that day from all evil animal passions, such as constriction, anger, and fear; and from all physical evils, such as labor, pain, excess, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And he should make present to himself things whose use has become habitual among people because of their fragrance and pleasant smell, such as festivity and similar things, in a quantity suitable for him.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the phlebotomist sit on a stool that is higher than the stool for bleeding; afterwards he should extend his arm and rub it himself with his hand two or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then let him tighten the cord with a strap and wind it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the tightness be moderate, for if the tightness is uneven, or too tight, then it hinders the flow of blood; and if too loose, then it also hinders the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after tying, it is necessary that the person to be bled rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then let the phlebotomist cleanse the site of bleeding with a small amount of old oil properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself, a little below the place where he wishes to make the incision, so that the vein does not flee and the blow is steadier.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because the veins are like a fleeing string during bloodletting; and there is one full of airiness; and when you place a lancet on it, it contracts under the lancet, deceiving the bloodletter, and the lancet does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it is narrow. Therefore, it is necessary that the bloodletter be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then he should put down the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If the vein is opened on the first attempt, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then try it again a little below that place, or above it with haste; if the place does not become swollen.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If it becomes swollen or the patient is frightened, then leave him for a day or two, and let the bandage not be tight.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps indeed a warm poultice will draw out the swelling.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 He should not enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then he may repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 But if the opening is small or the blood runs thinly; and you fear that not as much blood will come out as you wish: then try the lancet again in the same hole, following its straight course, and add a little to your work.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do this quickly, before the place becomes swollen; for a swollen place is common in many people during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If you see that it has already become swollen, then do not try again at all on the same place; for it does not excuse you from anything.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And put some olive residue on it; because it relieves the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 It is better for this purpose than oil itself and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly use olive residue in all your bloodlettings, where you hinder the flow of blood; and they do this with theriac of alfarach and with sagzenea, when one of them is placed on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 The blood is refined and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If an abscess occurs at the site of venesection, which often happens especially to those who are not bled except on that occasion or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly, over the spot: and tighten it for one hour because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And you should do that after the blood has exited from the vein itself, at its completion or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something black or green remains in the spot after a few days, it does not harm; and if you wish, place on it some dissolved aloe or myrrh, or some juice of mint, that is, pennyroyal, or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And indeed, abscesses and swellings often occur at the site of venesection on the basilic vein.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Therefore place your hand over it; if you find softness upon pressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Beware of placing on it any of what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood from the artery will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make a plaster for it with what has an astringent property, so that the spot may harden.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 And it is necessary to extract from every person a quantity of blood according to his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And that which appears from the color becoming over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it becomes red; and likewise if you see that it is thick, then let it flow until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, let its sharpness be taken away.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 And he who is full-bodied, strong, and needs a bloodletting once a year, should have the phlebotomy performed on the large vein, and let the phlebotomist be on the side: and in one who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 And it is appropriate to extract him at intervals, and that the opening should be narrow; and it is better that what is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein should be a transverse cut, not a prick.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and from cutting the nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy through length and width.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And he who is accustomed to fainting at the time of phlebotomy should eat before phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice, or if he is warm, let him take a drink: and draw blood from him three times, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 And if he is of a cold temperament, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in mulberry syrup, or in honey-syrup flavored with spices, or in aromatic fragrant syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If fainting occurs during phlebotomy, and the cause is the loss of much blood, then let him drink meat water and a thin fragrant syrup: and use aromatic spices with aloes, and anoint his chest with them; and use the other things that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 But he who wants to draw blood from his arm and loosen his blood a second time, for him whose phlebotomy is because of much evacuation and whose strength is weak, let him loosen the blood little by little according to the amount of strength, over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 "Whoever wishes to heal their arm and reduce blood on the second [day], and their body is strong: then let them do it after seven hours or nine from their first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 "But whoever wishes to draw blood from their body toward the opposite side of where it is inclined: it should be treated on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 "But in whose body the blood is already heated and sharpened, causing fever to occur: it is necessary that blood be drawn from them once, and a large amount be extracted; and the opening should be enlarged until syncope occurs. After preserving all the conditions of phlebotomy and placing your hand on their pulse along the course of the blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 "For this often happens when the person drawing the blood is ignorant and careless.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 "And it is not appropriate, when one wishes to heal an arm and draw blood on the second day, after the vein's opening has already closed and blood flow becomes difficult, to press hard on it with force and quickly stretch and bend [the arm].
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 "For that is very harmful; indeed, leave it alone until it is bled the second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 "Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy the clotted blood from the vein's opening and place on it some salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 "And place on it some of the tyrica al-farukh or sajzeena, and place a gentle pressure on it until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 "But if the vein has already formed an abscess, then leave it alone and do not cover it until the abscess settles.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 "But if necessity compels you to draw blood on the second day and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize above that same place or in another arm with another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The vein of the arm is bled in place of the Dark and the Palace, when they are not found or hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the manner of bleeding it is that the sick person puts his hand in warm water until it reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then it should be tied above with a moderately tight knot.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then make the incision crosswise little by little, not widthwise, nor lengthwise; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that it is made over the wrist slightly.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 But if the flow of blood is prevented, then repeatedly put your hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve what you need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 However, if it is a summer day, then you may dispense with repeating the hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And indeed the running of the blood into hot water is especially useful in wintertime.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And this vein's bleeding is safer than all other veins, because there is neither a pulsatile vein nor a nerve beneath it. 》
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 However, the bleeding of the little finger on the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the manner of its bleeding is that you tie the little finger with a string or your hand after putting it into warm water until the vein swells and becomes very noticeable to touch.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then make the incision crosswise.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it entirely, it will not harm it at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And be careful not to finish the bleeding while your hand is still being bled.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 Underneath it are the bare nerves of the fingers, exposed from the flesh. 》 》
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then put your hand back into the warm water and let the blood run into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not irrigate it with hot water, the blood clots at the vein's opening and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 So when you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not clot quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, you should do this with every tied-off branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 The remedy for bleeding that vein from the left hand is this: since it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen; and similarly do for its bleeding as you did for the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The remedy for bleeding the saphenous veins is for diseases of the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb and retention of menstrual flow, and kidney disease, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar ailments.  />
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the procedure for bleeding that vein is as follows: let the patient put his foot into hot water and rub it until the veins swell; then tie above the ankle with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 And indeed, the place of that vein is at the heel, visible toward the thumb; and many branches spread out from it on the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore bleed it either in its larger branch or at the heel where it joins; for this is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 But if you bleed it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your bleeding wound where you want to bleed it from the side, as if you wanted to cut it; and let the size of the incision be a Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 But if the flow of blood is blocked, then immerse his foot in hot water and allow the blood to flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the bloodletter errs in the first attempt and pierces a vein, he should repeat the phlebotomy slightly higher up, for the place is safe, and you need not fear any harm if you avoid the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot evenly.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The place for the sciatic vein, as we have said, is by the heel on the outer side of the foot.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And the benefit of phlebotomy from it is for pain in the ankle when due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 And the method of phlebotomy from it is that the patient should enter a bath and be in a hurry; and bind the leg from the side of the ankle up to above the heel with four fingers' width, using a fine long bandage, for it does not appear except for this reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears, then phlebotomize it by whatever method is possible for you, or by transfusion; and it is better to cut it with a cut or to divide it with a division.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 For its place is safer, and the vein itself is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it and it does not appear to the touch at all: then phlebotomize one of its branches, which is that one visible on the back of the foot, towards the little toe; and beware of the nerves, and let as much blood flow as you like.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then loosen the bandage, and place a piece of skin over the site of the phlebotomy, and bind the site.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 ¶ On Cupping and its Usefulness
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter 98
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 Cups are made from horn, from metal, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And cupping is done in two ways. ■
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 "With scarification and bloodletting: another method is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 "And this cupping that is without scarification is performed in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 "Either it is with fire,
Aut est absque igne.	 "Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 "And cuppings that are administered with scarification and bloodletting are in fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 "One of these is the cupping of Alnocrati, which is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, which are two flat parts of the neck on both sides together; and the cuppings of the chin, which are under the jawbone on the lower part of the mouth; and the cuppings of the two ribs; and the cuppings of Alachosos, which are at the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two loins, which are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 "And cupping, indeed, does not extract blood from the small dispersed veins in the flesh; and for this reason, it does not cause weakness as in phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 "Nor should cupping be administered, whether with fire or without, for any disease that results from fullness until the entire body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 "But if necessity requires cupping due to illness or habit, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in its middle, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 "That is because there are people who, when their blood increases and they need to extract it through cupping, find heaviness and dizziness in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 "And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among them is one who finds itching on his face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And among them is one who scratches the place of his farting.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one whose laughter is increased.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth; or the tongue swells up and he spits out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one whose sleep is increased.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And among them is one who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When therefore we see something of these things, and especially if it is in the third week of the month: then we order that a purging be done after two or three hours have passed from the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 But the relief of purging the neck is: because it contributes to heaviness in the head and what flows out into the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 And indeed it is necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body. 》
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And this purging takes the place of a phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it is not permissible for one who has a cold temperament or who has catarrh to use it. 》
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And because of this, it is not right that old people and those who have cold illnesses in the head should use them.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 But he who becomes habituated to it generates forgetfulness upon himself.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And because of this, it is necessary to order the purger that he lower his hand with the purging slightly downward, fearing from the cause of forgetfulness. 》 》
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 The purging called Alkehel is in place of a dark phlebotomy and a basilica phlebotomy, and because of this it helps with asthma, constriction of breath, cleft palate, coughing, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it is necessary that a cupping glass be applied briefly to al-Khayl, because if it is placed lower, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 However, cupping the al-Hadhim area is effective for headaches, migraines, and toothache; it is an alternative to basal phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And you should instruct the cupper not to press his hand on the skin after scarifying, lest he cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Cupping under the chin is effective for mouth ulcers and gum disease, as well as similar oral ailments; it serves as an alternative to phlebotomy of the lip corners.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Cupping with a spoon is effective for al-Khaffakh, which is caused by indigestion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Cupping the inner parts of the two groins is as beneficial as phlebotomy of the three veins, the basilic, cephalic, and median cubital; for it draws blood from all the small veins in the flesh, which in turn draw from larger veins, until the drawing reaches the three main veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And you should instruct the cupper not to cut too deeply when scarifying, since the area is bare of flesh and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 A cupping glass placed over the anus is effective for hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 And you should instruct the cupper to use a large cupping glass made of brass, since the area requires strong suction and fine glasses might break; he should also make a deep cut.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 Cupping the legs reduces swelling visibly, since it draws blood from the entire body; it relieves old pains in the kidneys, bladder, and uterus, stimulates menstruation, and improves complexion and appetite. It serves as an alternative to phlebotomy of both saphenous veins and the great metatarsal vein. )))
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 Indeed, they greatly weaken the body and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the remedy for Ventosarum of the leg is similar to the remedy for Ventosarum of two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The method for applying the Ventosa is as follows: first place the cup on an empty area and apply moderate suction. Do not prolong the position of the cup, but rather place and remove it quickly so that the humors may arrive at the site equally. Continue this process without interruption until you see the site become red and swollen, and the blood appear. At that point, make an incision, and then continue with gradual suction.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For those who have tender flesh and few pores, you should incise once only, no more, so that the site does not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And instruct the person applying the cups to widen the incision slightly and make it deep enough; they should regulate the suction so that it is gentle, quick, and smooth in motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is thickening of the blood, then you should incise twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 With the first incision, the way is opened for the thinning and watering down of the blood; with the second, it is subjected to a thorough examination of the thick blood’s extraction.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If, however, the blood is extremely dirty, then a third incision should be made so that it may reach its final state.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And in the end, when we want to extract the blood little by little or briefly, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we wish to make many extractions of blood, we should use many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure and find that the blood is thick, then it should be incised with a deep incision; and the equal limit of the incision’s depth is the thickness of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What is that which must be applied from the oils at the site of the Ventosa, and what should the one applying the Ventosa beware of?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 IN the case of one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary that the places to be ventosed be anointed with openings, softening, and dissolving oils: if it is in summertime, such as alkeiri oil, or violet oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or savory oil: and similar ones to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 But if the excess is thick and cold, then it should be bitter orange oil, or balm oil, or alben oil, or dill oil: and similar ones to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 But if the one to be ventosed has large pores and soft flesh, then it is necessary that he be kept from oil, and it is necessary that these wash the places to be ventosed with rose water, or cold water, or saltwater, or cucumber water, or purslane water: and similar ones to these. 》
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 But that one whose blood is very moist, should wash the ventosae with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac water: and similar ones to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 But that one whose excesses are thick, should wash his ventosae with old wine, or sage water, or dill decoction, or chamomile: and similar ones to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 And it is necessary that the ventosa be applied not in a bath or after a bath; indeed, it should be administered after an hour or two hours have passed since leaving the bath.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And it is not appropriate for anyone to sleep after ventilation.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 What should be done to ensure that the patient who needs to be ventilated or bled is properly prepared before ventilation?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that you should consider first of all: whether the patient who has been ventilated or bled is choleric and if sharpness and inflammation prevail in their blood, then they should receive cooling substances such as pomegranate seeds, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and cucumbers, and jujubes, and similar things. ¶
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And make his food soft, and give him cooked mutton, and foods prepared with sour sauce, and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 And if the patient's complexion is cold, it is appropriate for them to take in drink syrup of honey or of almond, and a dessert of seeds; and let them take medium-aged wine that is between old and new; and they should be advised to use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 And make his food soft, and let him have quails and small birds, and young pigeons is good for him.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 And it is appropriate that on the day of ventilation and bloodletting, drink should be more than food; and it is appropriate that in some people's drink, there should be given theriac alfaroch or a medicine from musk, that is muscat, or alesselithe before ventilation: and before bloodletting, or after: so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood may be refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not appropriate for them to take it in hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 About ventosas without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 But the ventosas which are without scarification are those which are placed on the liver and spleen, and on gout, and on the abdomen, and the navel, and on the places of the kidneys, and on the bladder; because these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And it is not sought through them except either by contact of blood from one member to another, as we place Ventose on the breasts in the disease of nasal blood flow.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to dissolve from the member cold and unseen windiness in the member, as we place Ventose on the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For she indeed rarefies the member and heats it and removes the pain for this reason: because she dissolves that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 It is also placed on the kidneys when an obstruction or stone occurs there.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 For perhaps by the power of its attraction it opens the obstruction or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly when it is placed on the liver and spleen for grinding windiness in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 And these Ventose are applied empty only with a cut.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in diseases of pleurisy: and this is done so that the Ventose may be filled with great hot water alone or with water in which appropriate herbs have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 ¶ The form of the Ventose applied with fire. ¶
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 Let its opening be two fingers wide as we have shaped it: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be on one of its sides, in the middle part, a small hole the size that can admit an awl: make it from copper or brass, thick-rimmed, smooth, equal, polished so that it does not harm the member upon which it is placed. And let there be in its center a transverse rod of copper or iron where a candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this Ventose is made large, larger than we have described and somewhat smaller than that one, according to the disease and age of the person using it. ¶
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 The swellings of boys and emaciated persons are different from those of men and robust bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The manner of applying this swelling with fire upon the member is to light a small wick made from linen or a small wax candle; and place it on the middle of a crossbar that is in the center of the swelling: so that the fire is kindled around the lower part of the swelling, that the body of the sick person is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then place it on the member; and let your finger be over the opening that I mentioned, until when we have the swelling in hand; as long as we need it, remove the finger, and steam will come out through that opening, and the swelling will immediately dissolve.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then extinguish the wick according to its manner, and repeat it, if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 However, in the swelling that is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no crossbar nor opening; and it is not applied except when filled with water and placed on the member alone.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And the larger this swelling is, so that it can hold much water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 ¶ On the suspension of leeches.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Leeches are not applied in many places except those where the position of cupping glasses is not possible due to their smallness, such as the lip and the gum, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or on members that have been stripped of flesh, such as the finger, nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the manner of using them is: that you come from leeches which are in sweet, clean waters free from rottenness. ↑
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they should be left day and night in sweet water until they are very hungry, and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then let the body be evacuated first with bloodletting and with clysters.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then wash the diseased part until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Then let them be placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are filled and fall off, and it is possible to draw the pus with a clyster, then it is more beneficial in the end; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then wash it thoroughly with water, and rub it, and squeeze it out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 But if the bleeding continues after the bloodletting, and it is due to sweating, then soak a cloth of flax in cold water and place it on top until the sweating stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if the bleeding increases, then sprinkle powdered sumac or gall nuts and other astringents on it until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or place half of a peeled bean on the spot and leave it until the beans stick to the spot, for then the bleeding will stop.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And if a repetition of bloodletting is necessary, whenever possible, change the site.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 But if leeches are prevented from feeding, then wash the spot with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or prick the spot with a needle until some blood comes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then apply them, for when they sense something from the blood, they will immediately stick on.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you want them to fall off, sprinkle some powdered aloes, or salt, or ashes on them and they will immediately fall off.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 ¶ End of the Second Section.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 ¶ Surgical Book of Albucasis Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 ¶ General discussion on reduction, dislocation, treatment of torsion and similar things.
Caput I.	 Chapter I. ︎
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also very often necessary in the art of medicine, and it deals with the reduction of fractures and dislocations that occur in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know, O Sons, that the foolish doctors and common people boast about this Chapter without ever having seen an ancient book or read a single letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, this method has been deprived of scientific knowledge in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I never found any good in it at all and did not gain from it what I gained except through the long reading of ancient books and deep study of their meaning until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I devoted myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And now I have described to you in this Chapter everything that my knowledge contains on that subject: and what my experimentation has passed over, after I have abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the labor of prolongation, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviations, and shown it at the end of declinations; and I have formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments used in it, with an addition to declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 ¶ Summaries and collections concerning the existence of bone fractures, from which a necessary introduction is required before we begin to recall the broken members, and various others if each.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 In the prologue of this Chapter, it is fitting to say summaries and headings that compel in the first place the artist to stop on their truth: namely so that you, and those who are eager to learn, may know or learn this noble art from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say, therefore, that when someone suffers a fracture, dislocation, twisting, or fall, then it is necessary in the first place to hasten to bleed him and purge him, or both together: unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or he who suffered one of these things is a boy or an old man weakened by age; or it is a time of very intense heat or very intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then let him be content with his food, with cold vegetables, and the meat of birds and goats; and avoid wine, fatty meats, and filling himself with food and all foods that fill the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until you are certain of the heat of the abscess and no longer fear its discharge into the limb, then the sick person should return to his original diet with which he was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the broken bone begins to heal, then it is necessary for the sick person to eat nourishing foods that are rich, thick, and heavy, with a viscous quality, such as dishes made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads, feet, and intestines of cows, eggs, fresh fish; and fatty wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 With this diet, the fracture heals more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that the bones of men who are in their prime or decrepit cannot always be joined and healed according to their nature due to the dryness of their limbs; rather, they heal and join like the bones of young children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 However, nature adds something like glue all around the broken bone, which has thickness and holds it together until they are joined to each other and bound together, until it reaches the end of strength and firmness as it was in the beginning, so that nothing hinders it from its functions: and for this reason it is necessary to give the sick person food that contains heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And know that the kinds of fractures are different according to the diversity of limbs, for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly all other limbs are different from each other. And I have come with the description of every kind of fracture exposed in its own chapter, distinguished from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 And various kinds of bone fractures are also distinguished from each other.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Because the fracture is curved, besides which stars occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes the fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and its fractures are splinters, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as they are in a reed when it is fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And the ones that do not protrude: and there is a fracture with a wound and tearing at the end; and there is a small crack fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And each type has its own tool or implement for its restoration, as its description will come, distinguished in their respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from that by which a bone fracture is known is its twisting and protrusion; and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor a sound when you touch the bone with movement, and the patient does not feel great pain, then there is no fracture there; rather, it is possible that it is a slight twist or small crack. Therefore, you should not move it at all with your hand and compression, but place upon it some of the medicines whose description follows after the appropriate time for the place: then let it be bound tightly with a fine bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that when a place is curved and divided into two, besides which splinters occur in it, yet every part is separated from its mate; then you should begin at the hour to straighten it, equalizing it before a hot abscess occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If, however, a hot abscess occurs in it, then leave it for some days until the abscess quiets down.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then straighten it by whatever method you can from gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that its restoration and alignment are easier than bone, in which fractures occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then tie it according to how you remember it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 But if there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from two parts, whether it is a hand or a foot; either with your hand, if it is a small limb; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And let your position be such that you place the limb on an even surface according to its natural shape until the parts of the broken limb are extended; then strive with all your skill and in any way you can to return those additions to their places, and take care not to cause pain or injury to the weakened part through your operation. And strive with all your skill to join one of the two bones with its mate according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And it is necessary at that moment for you to test and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 Therefore, if you see something different there, correct it and make it even according to the measure of your skill.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For often through their operation they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb, as we have seen happen many times from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then bind it after alignment and proper treatment, and the constriction of that limb, and its rest and tranquility; and advise the patient regarding it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And instruct him to take care not to move it during the hours of his watchfulness and sleep, and during his turning and tossing, and during his evacuation, and all his movements with all his might. 》
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And to beware that the position of the limb is not one in which pain will follow.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 What this means is: "When one feels pain or injury in a limb's position and arrangement, it is necessary to change its position to another that does not cause pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 "And take care with that, so its position is equal and straight; so that when it is restored, the limb does not become twisted.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 "And the nature of a fractured limb's constriction is as I tell you.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 "Know that fractured limbs are distinguished by their size and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 "Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, or cheekbone, then it is necessary for there to be a soft, thin wrapping of cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 "But those that are large, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary for there to be a wide, hard wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 "Because a broad bandage secures a large limb and binds it equally from all sides, so that no blemish enters into it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 "Then after your evacuation from equalizing, begin to place an appropriate ointment onto soft tow for the site of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 "Then begin to wrap the bandage over the site of the fracture with three or four turns, according to what the limb deserves; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 "Then go with it to the upper part away from the site of the fracture, and tighten less than your previous binding where you bound the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 "Then extend yourself with the wrapping slightly from the site of the fracture and gradually soften the binding until you take something great from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 "Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with turns.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 "Then go with the wrapping to the lower part away from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your operation be on the constriction of the invagination and its softening, as we have said in the first upper invagination.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the invaginations some soft wool or cloth, which matches the twist of the break, if there is any twist: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then roll another one on top of that same thread.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Afterwards, immediately apply to these invaginations equal and well-made plasters, if there is no swelling or hot abscess in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 But if there is swelling or an abscess in it: then place on it that which can settle the abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then bind plasters over it at that time.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And let the plasters be made from half-wide, planed, and wisely shaped reeds; or they may be of wood from which sieves are made, that is, made from pine or gerad, that is, palm branches or calingi; and let the breadth of each plaster be according to this form, and the same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, it is necessary that the plaster placed on the affected part be a little thicker and wider than the other plasters; and let the length of the plaster be according to what is permitted by the member, in terms of size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then bind another thread over the plasters, with the same first constriction.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind over it with fine threads as we have said about the constriction; and it is necessary that your constriction on the place of the break be more, and the farther away from the break it extends, the less the constriction should be.  />
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 And it is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and let them be from soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 Because if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the work of foolish people placing their threads from twisted linen cords, it is a great mistake; for the constriction with them falls outside of its quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And fine threads are not suitable again because you will not achieve through them that which you desire due to constriction.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 It is not necessary for the space between star and star to be less than a finger's width.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the patient is harmed by the tips of the stars after constriction in healthy places, then place under them soft tow or carded wool until no harm occurs from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When there is a break with a wound and a disruption of the skin occurs, I will refer back to it in Chapter Two individually.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken bone should be constricted with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 That is, because when a bone is large, you should not place stars on it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the occurrence of hot inflammation.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients used to restore [the limb], which are placed on a break and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 ¶ The abbreviated common method of a restorative plaster for a break, suitable for most complexions, especially women and children: because it is made from that which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 It is made by taking the flour of a mill, which is the marrow of flour that hangs on the walls of the mill during the turning of the stone; and make it up just as it is, except that you should sift it with egg white; and place its preparation not thick nor fine.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 ¶ Another method of a plaster restoring a break, dislocation, and twist.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Take mastic, and laudanum, and acacia, and elecampane, and mugwort; and the juice of all of them, each 10 drams, myrrh 5 drams, and aloes, both 5 drams, and aleth (i.e., gum tragacanth) 20 drams. Let all be ground, sifted, and mixed with aleth water; or with egg white, if the patient's complexion is hot.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is of good composition, it quickly restores broken bones and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method of the plaster, which also benefits fracture and dislocation.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Take mugwort, pennyroyal, and white hellebore, each 10 drams; of myrrh and both kinds of aloes, each 5 drams; acacia, 6 drams; Armenian bole, 20 drams. Reduce all to a fine powder, sift, and mix with water or egg white. Apply it as a plaster.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Method of the plaster for joints and separated bones from their places; and it alleviates the pain that occurs to them, and bone splitting, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take freshly shorn wool and soak it in boiled vinegar and oil; then place it on the area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 And indeed this plaster does not have the power of restoration, but it is good for alleviating hot inflammation and properly drives away pain.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Method of the plaster that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take leaves of the deaf fig and wild poppy leaves; grind all together and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Method of the shortened plaster, applied for the restoration of a bone fracture and when you wish to resolve any remaining inflammation.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Take the root of black hellebore, camomile, violet flowers, and grass flour, each one part; grind all together and mix with wine if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is heated, then mix it with water of fresh coriander or with water and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another method of a stronger plaster for resolving hard inflammation during the restoration of a limb, stronger than this first one. xspace
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 A recipe of the root of altea, linseed, balaustia, mellilotus, samsuci, violet flower, and chamomile, all taken in equal parts. Grind everything and prepare with willow water or sweet water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 All of this according to the heat of the limb and the stillness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates however did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration except a plaster made of wax and oil; nothing else, and he reported that it is a middle ground between coarseness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 But Galen thought that things should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration which contain the drying of heat, such as myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and similar things from those which we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 The manner of a poultice that helps with injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Take mugwort and chickpeas, and human hair that has been cut or bird feathers, and altea, and salt in equal parts; grind them and sift them and make a poultice from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity by which it is necessary that the binding should remain, then be loosened, is this: you must see if no pain or itching happens to the patient, and the broken bone does not move from its place; then do not loosen it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 But if intense itching or troubling pain or swelling happens to him, then hurry and loosen it right away, and remove the poultice from him; and take a soft cloth or a soft sponge moistened with water, and dip it in warm water and wash the place with it until the itching quiets down and the pain is soothed.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place upon it a piece of wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil; and bind it on for one night, until you are secure from hot swelling, the limb's swelling subsides, and its pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then apply to it a fine bandage and a small plaster; and do not bind it too tightly at first, but keep the bandages loose with it until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and you no longer need plasters or bandages, then bind it as you did at first, evenly.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing happens to the limb as we have said, then do not remove it before three days, or four, five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is removed after twenty days, the whole thing according to what you see from the unwrapping of the limb, as we have said, until the bone has healed and the flesh has coagulated over it: add also then to the bandage more than your first entire bandage; and add also in feeding the patient, as his strength returns.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 But if you see the place of the break becoming excessively dry and thin: then know that the nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Moisten it with warm water every time you unwrap it, and let that be for all three days, and slightly loosen the bandage.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 By this procedure the nourishment reaches the limb and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 The foolish restorers who do something else with a broken limb when it is not set correctly at first, and then set it crookedly, are making an error in their procedure and have great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said so in their books and would have practiced thus.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I have not seen any trace of them there at all, and it is better that it should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 On the making of a swelling on the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 The kinds of fracture are various, and its shapes many; and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For there is a type of fracture which happens from a blow with a sword; and the blow removes the bone entirely to where it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an ax does in wood; and because of this, this type of fracture is named Axial. 
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the sword strikes something of the bone, and it strikes its surface but does not penetrate as far as its end; and this type of fracture is named Kalaan, that is, Clean Incision.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And there are two types of fractures, either large or small.  
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And there is a type of fracture which is a crushing or grinding; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or falling onto a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this type of fracture can also be either penetrating, which is near the panniculum that is under the bone; or it can be on the surface of the bone; and there are two types of wounds from these two fractures: either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And there is a type of fracture which is hidden in the bone as fine as hair; and it is a small crack; and because of this, this type of fracture is named Hairline.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And among these is the type of fracture which happens from a fall or blow with a stone and similar things, which cause a layer of bone to sink into its depths, and a depression occurs; just as happens in copper pots when they are struck, and part of them goes inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And this happens most often in the heads of soft bones, such as children's heads.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And for all these kinds of fractures, splints are separated out, and I will come with the recollection of that entire thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we know all these kinds of fractures by examination of them, and investigation with probes, and removal of the corrupted flesh that is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 Moreover, the hairy kind is known by this: it is uncovered on the bone, and it is cleansed and anointed with wax upon it; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the conditions of the patient; then if you see from his condition something that clearly indicates danger, such as choleric vomiting, distension, loss of consciousness, hoarseness, fainting, acute fever, protrusion of the eyes, their redness, and similar symptoms in various constitutions, certainly he will not be cured; but if you see conditions that do not frighten you and you hope for a cure, then begin his treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 That is, if a wounded man comes to you first when he is wounded; and this is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every constitution.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest that which is under the bone from the membrane be corrupted and those symptoms which we have mentioned occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 But if the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain and is accompanied by fragments and swelling; then it is necessary that you cut away the crushed and swollen part, as I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is necessary that you shave the head of the wounded man and uncover the bone in whatever way possible for you; according to the shape of the wound and what is easy for the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If there should be a flow of blood or a hot swelling while exposing the bone, then apply to it what is needed.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is that you should fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the swelling subsides and you are secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin with the cure of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 Indeed, the first method is that you cut the bone with a trephine of sharp edge, and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then administer another trephine after the first one, which is wider by a little bit, and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then also administer another trephine wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is that you have with you a number of different trephines, some wider than others and some shorter than others, and at their ends they are sharpened, and they are made from iron or steel. Use skill in striking on the trephine so that it does not shake the head and harm it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 But if the bone happens to be hard and tough, then you should bore around it with non-penetrating trephines called non-penetrating trephines, and they are not so called except because they do not pass through to the end of the bony part that is behind it; because the extremity of the trephine is rounded on what is under its sharp point, similar to a small circle, and it prevents sinking in and passing through the thickness of the bone. 》
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it is fitting for you to take from these trephines a great number, each of which fits the thickness of the bone, until you have a trephine for every skull, whose length and shortness of its sharp extremity is according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And these are the forms of three types of trepans, or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of penetration around the broken bone is such that you place the trepan on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the trepan to another place and put it between every opening a quantity equal to the thickness of the radius, or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with the chisels that which is between every opening from the bone and make it thinner than you can above that to the limit of thinness, as we have said, until you extract the bone either by hand or with some other of the instruments which you have prepared for that purpose, such as tweezers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And you must be very careful that the trepan or chisel does not touch anything of the brain.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 Therefore, when you have circled the bone by penetrating and separated it from the brain, if it is continuous with it and you have extracted it, it is necessary to scrape and smooth the remaining end of it in the bone with another similar instrument like a chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 However, it must be thin and more delicate than other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If there remains anything of the small fragments and splinters then take it easily with one of the instruments which you have with you.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound afterwards with the linen cloths and ointments which we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 And there is another method of operating which is completely free from danger, as Galen said and praised it greatly, saying this:
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 It is necessary for you first to begin exposing the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and evident until, when you have exposed that part and placed under it the end of this lenticular chisel, whose form is as follows: 
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the lens-shaped part, which is soft and does not cut anything, and its pointed part on both sides of it going along the length, as you see, so that the lens-shaped part rests against the cheek, with its pointed end striking the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike the jaw from one side with a small hammer until you cut through the entire bone easily, as I have shown: and you should be confident that nothing will happen to it that you fear at all.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the doctor were not more foolish than other men and less ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it off from there with the pointed end of the lens-shaped instrument itself, and free it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 For it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 And if the bone's fracture does not reach to the cloth, and what is cut off from the bone is its surface, and roughnesses and fine splinters remain in it; then you must scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine scrapers of various sizes which you have prepared, so that you can use from them the most suitable and straightest ones for each place, according to what the operation requires, and the broken bone itself, and its shape. 》
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And you must use first, with those scrapers, a broader one to scrape the bone.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not stop doing this continuously until you reach using the thinnest and finest of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 But in each of the remaining small hairline cracks and fine fractures, you must take care to straighten it according to what is needed for that.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And it is a matter that is not hidden to anyone who has any interest in this art, and we have written about it and demonstrated it in the case of large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 But if the skin flap remains attached when you pull out a tooth: then you should take a piece of linen cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another piece of linen cloth, folded double or triple, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth: and make that as easy as possible on top of it, so that it does not cause pressure.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then apply a broad bandage over it; and do not tighten it except to the extent that it holds only the wound; and leave it with this care for one day or two days, until you are sure of avoiding hot inflammation.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then remove it and apply afterwards medications that are dry in nature, such as lily roots, henbane seed flour, frankincense powder, birthwort, and similar to these: and this is how you make a powder from these medications to be dusted on the wound like dry substances.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And universally apply on it every medication that has the property to cleanse and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful according to your ability that the wound is clean in your treatment: and there is no dirt from oil or grease in it.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 And do not allow pus to accumulate on it at all: for when pus accumulates on the skin of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, and a great evil happens to the patient afterwards; and this often happens with siphac of the head, when the bone is cleansed from it, especially when its care is neglected, a blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 "Therefore, if such events occur to the patient, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if the blackening does not occur except from the medicine that is placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make that blackness: then you should take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and soak a cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on the sore; afterward, treat it with appropriate remedies until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 "On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 "Know that only two parts of the nose can be broken at once or one of them: because there are two bones in it. The lower part is cartilaginous and cannot break; it only sustains rubbing, twisting, and compression.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril and with your index finger and thumb on the outside, adjust the fracture until the nose returns to its natural shape; this should be done skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And be careful that during your operation no pain occurs to the patient.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then you should use the end of a small bone with some thickness to adjust it.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture is in both parts, then do the same; and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture if possible. 😊
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day when the swelling has abated.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a cloth plug made of linen into the tip of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two plugs if the fracture is in both parts: and let the thickness of the plug be such that it fills the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some of the ancient restorers said that they should be infused with linseed in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 That, however, does not seem right to me; rather, linseed should be infused with the white of an egg, made into a powder.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then leave the linseed until the bone hardens and the cartilage thickens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of linseed, after it has been wrapped with soft cloth; this holds the broken nose more firmly and allows the patient to breathe without obstruction.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you want, do that; and if you want, do linseed.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 But if the nose swells again while you are treating an abscess, apply a plaster to the nose with ketron or cotton soaked in rose oil or a little dyacon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if the abscess does not swell again, then you should apply plasters made with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place soft wool on it, and do not bind the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 But if the bones of a small broken nose are fractured or shattered, then you should cut open and extract them with suitable instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then either stitch it up or care for it with what promotes healing and consolidation from suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 But if there is a wound between the nose and lip, then you should treat it with linseed poultices; and insert a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 ¶ On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	 Chapter Five
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is broken and there is no wound: observe then if the fracture is only on the outside and does not break into two pieces but bends towards the inside; then its diagnosis is easy.  /> If, however, it breaks into two pieces, its diagnosis is difficult, except for when one piece is missing.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if there is a fracture on the right side, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, then insert your right index finger. And with it, push the swelling of the fracture from within to the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and make it even with that.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the mandible is already divided into two parts, then it is necessary to administer traction from both sides in a straight line until equalization becomes possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 However, if there is displacement or separation of the teeth, then tie them with gold thread, silver thread, or silk from which you hope they will remain.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place a bandage on the fractured mandible.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place a doubled cloth over it, and place a large, well-made spica over the cloth, or a piece of sole skin equal in length to the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it on top according to how its bandage is prepared and the application of it is suitable until it does not fall apart; and instruct the patient to be calm and at rest, and give him soft food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 However, if you think that the shape has changed in any way, then hurry and remove it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has changed from it, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour after you have removed the bandage; and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 Therefore, while that plaster remains attached to it and the arrangement of the bone does not change, leave it unremoved until healing occurs; or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 Indeed, this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If a hot abscess should occur in the meantime, then administer what we have often said for its relief until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if there is a fracture with a wound, consider this:
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 For if already a fragment has separated from the bone, or from the saw: then be skillful in this, that you remove those fragments of the saw with what is suitable to you for their removal among instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 But if the opening of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a fleam according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you have removed the saw fragments and none of them remain, or if the opening of the wound is wide; and if not, place on it one of those plasters which are suitable for it, and let it grow flesh until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 ¶ On Restoring a Clavicle When It Is Broken
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 Indeed, a clavicle is most often broken from the anterior part of the arm, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Or it breaks and separates into two parts, besides which fragments may occur in it: and that is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or so, that fragments occur in the bone: and that is more difficult to restore. 》
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or it may be a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation in it when there is a fracture without a wound is to have present two assistants, so that one of them holds up what follows the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then make the fracture equal with your fingers until it takes its proper shape: and there should not be any prominence or depression in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's armpit a sphere of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and squeeze the sphere with your hand until you make the fracture equal, as is necessary. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot pull the end of the fork to the outside, because it has reached the depths, then the patient must be turned onto their back; and place a medium-sized cushion under their shoulder, and have an assistant press down on the shoulder until the fork bone that is deep inside comes up. Then set right the fracture, and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If you feel a splinter from the fork and it moves, then you should scrape over it and extract the splinter easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 But if it is lodged in the bone, then make an incision over it with one of the knives you have prepared for this purpose. After placing under the fork a tool that preserves the marrow; and this tool should be made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a spoon without the hollow part.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And its width should be according to your need, based on the size and thinness of the bone.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length of it should also be as much as is possible for you to work with.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 But if the wound that you made when you extracted the bone splinter is wide and free from any hot inflammation, then join the two lips of the wound with a stitch.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the wound is small or you fear a hot inflammation, then fill the wound with cloths and soft wool according to the size of the cut in the wound.  \\*  \\
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 But if a hot inflammation occurs, then dip a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on the wound.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 A narrowing of the bone without a wound or cut is treated by placing on the bone an ointment made from flour and egg white.  \\*  \\  \\*  \\
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place soft wool over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a sphere under his nipple, if you need that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a roll of cotton, which is what the Saracens use, and let it be very long; its width should be that of one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place two layers of soft cloth over the wool and the plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take a small wooden board, whose width is three fingers, and likewise in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then wrap that cloth with the board in the place of the himema which falls over the break and the wound.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the himema over the break as it is wrapped, and wrap it around his neck, under his sound nipple, and under his afflicted nipple; and bring it back over all the parts, so that the bandage holds the break firmly in place: and this should not be hidden from you, and all of it, so that the board is not removed from the broken part.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And for this reason, you must look at the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Whenever the bandage becomes loose and you see that the board has moved, then correct it and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the patient's sleep on his back, and put under his sound nipple, near his sleep, a small pillow at night, so that with it his help will be lifted from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Therefore, the break of the collarbone is healed by lifting the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind his arm to his own neck; and do not loosen the bandage, unless it happens in that place from itching or swelling, for twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster, if you see his face turning to it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add to the bandage, and leave him alone until he is healed and solidifies.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 And indeed the fracture of the collarbone is tied and strengthened for the most part within twenty-eight days, and sometimes it happens in some people within a shorter period.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 On the treatment of a fractured rib.
Caput VII.	 Chapter Seven.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 Rarely is a rib broken, and only in its broad part; from it, only its edges are broken.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 So when it is broken in that place and is broken in the middle of it and is not known except by touch, then prepare it according to the shape of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And reduce it to its natural shape by every means possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place on the site powder of ground linen seed with the membrane of an egg and soft tow and place a little cloth from a doubled garment over it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place on it a broad splint made of thin wood according to the size of the whole rib, or slightly larger than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If however there is any hollow under the splint in some part of the rib, then even it out with soft tow until the splint descends to an equal level.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then tie it over with a long bandage of appropriate tightness and firmness of the splint, until it does not move from its place. ︎
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And examine the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever therefore the bandage becomes loose, tighten it and even out the splint if it has moved from its place; and let the patient lie on his sound side. ︎ ︎ ︎
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And a rib is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 Therefore when this number is completed, then loosen the bandage; and you should be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it [the rib] is of bones whose grinding is not feared, nor their dissolution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 But if a piece of bone protrudes and stings under the skin, then cut over it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do what we said regarding a fracture of the collarbone from inflammation, if something happens due to that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 ¶ On the restoration of a breast fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter Eight.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The breast is sometimes broken in its middle, and this happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Its extremities are most often broken and crushed due to injuries.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When its middle is broken and it leans towards the lower part, a severe pain occurs, along with difficulty in breathing and coughing; and sometimes blood may be vomited, and there will be a concavity in the fractured bone, which will not escape notice. The treatment for this is to have the patient lie on his back; place cushions under his shoulders. ething
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press his shoulders and bring the ribs together from both sides with your hands; and adjust it in equilibrium as much as possible and is suitable until the shape of the bone returns to what is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place a plaster and tow on him; then put a board made of thin willow or linden, or similar light materials on top after you wrap it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then adjust the bandage over the fractured bone so that it does not move; and pass the bandage around to the back several times, tightening it with a proper tightness. ething ething
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then inspect the bandage every hour and whenever it loosens, tighten it; and if its necessity calls for its release due to itching or ulceration that occurs in the place, or pain, or inflammation, then hurry and release it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has happened with its treatment method. ething
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then reapply the plaster if you see it is needed; and fasten it with a bandage until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	 Chapter 9
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that the fracture of ribs does not occur except in the thick parts that follow the spine and from their ends on the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And abrasion does not happen to them except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the senses when examined with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And its restoration is done by evening out the fracture with the fingers to the extent possible, until the shape becomes even as it should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply a plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the fracture of the ribs is slanted towards the inside: then a very severe pain and sharpness occurs to the patient, like that puncture which occurs in pleurisy; because the bone pricks the membrane. And also difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting much blood occurs. This is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients have devised many ingenious methods for it; among them are those who say that you should give food to the patient which generates inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly may be inflamed and extended, and the fracture pushed outwards. )))
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 But we ourselves detest it, lest a quick cause be made for producing a hot abscess, if it has not happened already.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If however it has already occurred, then it adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them have said: a cupping glass should be placed on the location, then drawn out with force, and this is similar to reasoning. )))
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, it must be feared that the cupping may draw superfluities to the location because of the weakness of the condition. ))) )))
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them have said: the location should be covered with wool which has already been soaked in hot oil, and small pieces of cloth should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that there may be an equal bandage when you wrap it around according to its roundness. ))) ))) ))) )))
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then let the patient be treated with a diet and medicine for pleurisy.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If a strong force constricts the patient and he cannot tolerate it, and the skin is pricked with a wounding puncture, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary that we cut open the place and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then let us place on it an instrument that conserves the siphon, of which we have previously spoken; and let us cut the skin easily, and let us cut into it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we will bring together the two lips of the wound with a stitch, if it is large; and we will treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If it happens that a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then hasten and pour powder into rose oil, and place it on the spot; and let the patient be treated with what is suitable for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 In the meantime, he should also be turned onto his side where he sleeps, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 ¶ On the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter 10
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fracture indeed sometimes happens to the bones of the neck, and rarely do they suffer attrition; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether he will heal or not heal, then make an examination.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see his hands already softened and insensible and dead; and he cannot move them or stretch them out, or draw them back together; and when you press them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and there is no pain in them: then know that he will not heal, and in many dispositions it is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 But if he moves them and feels the pressure with his fingers and the prick: then know that the bone of the neck is sound, and that the patient will heal with treatment. ‌
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If it happens similarly in the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider his feet: if you see that they have become soft, and the same thing happens to them as happened to the hands; when he lies on his back, flatulence and evacuation occur involuntarily; and when he is turned onto his stomach, evacuation occurs involuntarily; and when he is turned onto his back again and wishes to urinate but cannot, then you should know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore, do not labor over his cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If, however, nothing of this kind happens to him, the case is less serious.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for what has happened is to try to reduce the hot swelling in this way: place crushed rose oil alone on the vertebra, or mixed with cooked egg yolks.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Apply this to the site several times a day until the hot swelling is reduced; then place one of the strengthening plasters on the spot, and bind it tightly with a bandage. Advise the patient to rest quietly.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 Let him not sleep on the part where he finds pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If the bone has been splintered or something that has already separated from it occurs; then it is necessary to open the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then join the two lips of the wound with a stitch if it is large.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with some healing ointment until he heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If the last bone of the tail is broken, then it is necessary to insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus and align the broken bone with your other hand as best you can, and make another alignment.  />
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on top and remove it; and treat the wound with the preceding treatment until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 About the restoration of a hook.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 The bones of hooks rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they do break, then their fracture is not complete, but rather a comminuted fracture at the ends themselves; and they split along their length and bend towards the inside; and there occurs pain in the area and a puncture wound; and the affected leg becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And its restoration is as follows: extend your hand over it until you stand above the fracture so that you can see its shape.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at its ends, then equalize that fracture with what you have prepared from the equalization, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 However, if the fracture is along its length or has already bent towards the inside, then have the patient lie on his back until you prepare for the restoration of that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you have equalized it, place a plaster on it; then place on it a splint made of wood or skin, and bind it tightly with a bandage that will not cause displacement of the fracture or dislodgement of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And fill the concavity of the bones with what will fill it until the bandage takes it up evenly; and instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If a hot abscess forms on it, then cease from extending and restoring it until the hot abscess is settled; and place upon it what will settle it, as was mentioned before, and then return to its restoration; and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If however a fragment of bone is driven into it or it becomes comminuted, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 The restoration of a broken elbow.
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The elbow is that part which is between the bend of the arm and the head of the ulna.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, in the following shape.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And two ligaments are tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is hung from a high place, and the patient sits on a seat. ➤
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then he throws his broken arm over the wood until it reaches its tip, in whose middle is attached the curvature of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then something heavy is hung above it, so that the servant extends downwards. ➤ ➤
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician straightens the break with his hands at the same time, until the break returns as it should. ➤ ➤ ➤
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 The other method is that the patient lies on his back with his head hanging over the edge of the bed. And the hand is suspended from the neck with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then instruct two assistants to hold the one above the break with their hands, and the other below it, and each of them pulls towards his own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you wish for a stronger extension, then tie with a ligament below the break and above it with another ligament, and each of the two assistants pulls towards his own side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the break is near the end of the arm, then a ligament should be placed under the tip, and another under the break towards the elbow. ➤
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly, if the break is near the elbow, then a ligament should be placed over that place and over the elbow itself. ➤ ➤ ➤
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then straighten the break with ease and without difficulty, until when the break is straightened as it should be and a good bandage is applied, then tie it if no hot swelling occurs. ➤ ➤ ➤ ➤
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 If indeed a warm abscess occurs, then release the constriction until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 And place on it a wool swab soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides; then constrict it. And the way to constrict it is that you should place a plaster over the break.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then gather the arm to the support itself and place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 And place a cloth and bind it on the support of the arm, so that the arm may stand in place of crutches; if nothing prevents you from this, nor will anything be changed upon you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 But if you fear that something will change upon you from the broken bone, then use crutches; and it is as if you place on the very break a crutch which is wider and stronger than the other crutches.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place between each crutch a width of one finger; and let the length of the crutches be according to the break with an addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind over the crutches the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is that your bandage should be tighter on the place of the break.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And the more the break is lengthened, let the bandage be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 Therefore, if you see the placement of the crutches and the bandage as we have said in the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do: and if you fear a warm abscess, then release the bandage and crutches until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then examine the bandage for three days to see if there is no itching or swelling in the place, or if food is prevented from reaching the limb because of the arrangement of the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore, correct all that as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If indeed it is due to a hernia, so that nothing should happen from it: then do not release the ligature until after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 And let the patient lie on his back, and place his hand on his abdomen; and put under the pillow a cushion filled with wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And be careful at every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb not be disturbed, or that the ligature become loose.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Therefore correct it all with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 And give the patient food according to the order which we have mentioned earlier, so that the first food be fine; and continue this until the mouth begins to close up; then it is necessary to thicken his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For the custom of the pillow and the leg is to be tight for forty days; therefore, it must then be released, and a bath should be administered, and it should be treated with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture is foul and crushed, then do not remove from it the ligature or splints until after fifty days, or two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 About the restoration of a broken arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is composed of two bones which are called the two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 Of these, one is small; and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and it is that which is placed under the smaller from below.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore perhaps only the larger forearm bone breaks, or perhaps only the smaller one; and perhaps they both break together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 Therefore when the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the forearm bone is broken below, it is a bad break, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And worse than that, it is when the two bones are broken together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If therefore the bone which is broken is slightly higher up, then it is suitable for the physician in restoring it to place a slight extension with ease, until he aligns it.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 If however the bone that is broken is large, then it is necessary to place a very strong constriction.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary to place the hand form for its restoration, and that extension extended over the elbow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be lower than all the fingers or the rest; and let the sitting sick person be square with himself, and let the elbow be before him or straight with him, in height so that the sick person does not fall into labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then let the assistant stretch the arm from the lower part, either by his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another assistant should stretch it likewise from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then let the physician align the bone until he restores it to its best shape as possible. ➤
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 And if there are fragments in the bone's break, then strive to restore each piece to its own place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 But if a separated fragment appears in it, and pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration; then cut over it, and remove it according to the manner we have said above among those things which are premised. ➤
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 But if the break is with a wound, I have already made for it a separate chapter; therefore take its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 But if a hot abscess happens at the beginning of your restoration, then place a cloth made with salve from rose oil and white wax, and let its thickness be between thinness and thickness; and bind the cloth over it with a fine constriction, until the abscess settles down. Then remove the salve and place a prepared plaster made from flour of millstones with egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place a splint, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in many arrangements: whether the fracture is in one third or two thirds simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your bandage over the fracture site stronger and more firmly, and slightly longer than the bandage at the upper part of the fracture or its lower part: or place a softer bandage for a moment, as previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture be soft, moist: and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread with which it is tied be of proper linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 And consider the limb and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something happens which requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb: then you should anoint the limb with heated water until the itching subsides, and leave the limb unbound until it subsides, then repeat the bandaging.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 But if the bandage is already softened and the bone is already moved, and similar [conditions]: then correct all of it with your skill, and examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 For if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to the excess of bandaging, then you should soften it slightly and leave it for several days until the nourishment reaches it, then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if nothing of those things that we mentioned happens to the patient, then it is not necessary to loosen [the bandage], unless after twenty days or thereabouts.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then let the hand of the patient be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be level and guarded with skill from sudden movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or perhaps in thirty-two days; and it may be restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 All of that depends on the temperament of the constitution and the strength of the individual.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 ¶ On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that a fracture of the metacarpals and the interphalangeal joints of the fingers is rare.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 And it does not happen unless there has been much attrition.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When therefore a fracture or attrition of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the invalid sits with his legs extended, and before him there should be a seat of equal height.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand on top of it, extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then the assistant should stretch the broken bones and the physician should make them even until they join with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary to place a plaster and tow on it, if no hot abscess occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place a bandage on top according to the size of the place, and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.  ·
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 But if the fracture is in the lower part of the sole, then make something similar to a sphere from cloth; and instruct the invalid to press it with his broken sole; then let it be tied with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the bandage be made of leather, in which there is softness, so that it may be applied to the body of the sole; and tie it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary to place one bandage on top and another below on the sole; and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then place a tie as the hand is wrapped; and stretch between the fingers with a bandage.  ·  ·
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If a fracture occurs to any of the interphalangeal joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be made even as necessary.  ·  ·
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then let it be strung with a thin cord, and if you wish, place a small straight splint on it, so that the break may be lifted up and not move about.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the fracture is in one of the other fingers, such as the middle finger, index finger, ring finger, or little finger, then it should be made equal and tied to the healthy finger following it; or all of them can be tied together according to their continuation, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place a small splint upon it, as we have said concerning the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And take into account in your restoration and after the initial arrangement of the warm swelling; and do what is necessary when something happens because of it, according to the recurrence of its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 ¶ On the Restoration of a Fractured Hip.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The hip bone is often broken and it becomes apparent to the sense because it turns toward the interior and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration is done thus: that a ligament be placed above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 And the patient should be laid on his face. }}}
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then let the assistant stretch every ligament to its corresponding part equally; and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 But if the break is near the root of the hip, then let one ligament be to the pubis bone so that the extension may fall upward; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And in a similar way if the break is near the knee, then let one ligament be near the knee so that the extension may be toward below.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then let the physician make the bone equal with both of his hands until he brings it back to its natural form; and let the bone be joined with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then it is necessary that you place a plaster and bandage on it if there is no swelling of the limb. }}}
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for some days until the abscess becomes hot, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 Its constriction should be thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary that you roll upon the fracture a thick bandage, that is, a binding, and fold it double or triple, and let there be some excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the base of the big toe.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And introduce a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee on the lower side, and let the ends of the thread come out from the upper part in two places.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then wrap the excess of the bandage over the leg and hip.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place on the hip in the place of the fracture itself a bandage, and from it place one bandage over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the constriction may be equal.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin with a strong constriction from the middle over the place of the fracture with three or four windings.  />
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you extend more with the bandage from the place of the fracture, let your constriction be smaller and softer and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then pull on the two ends of the thread that you introduced between the hip and leg.  />
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie therefore with both three bandages which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower part until you reach the ankle bone of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And with both tie also the ends of the bandages on the other side, so that the bandage may not be moved from its place.  />
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then leave the constriction upon it while it remains, so that no rotting, nor abscess, nor swelling, or things similar to these may occur in the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If something from this occurs.  />
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore, hasten with its treatment, and correct whatever has happened because of it entirely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If there is a fragment of bone that is causing pain: then you must smooth it out if possible.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, cover it with something and remove it; and treat it as was mentioned before, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And sometimes this hip fracture is bandaged, apart from what was added to it as we said for the thigh and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, when this sort of broken bone is healed, the patient does not limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if it is healed alone, without the other leg being attached to it, then it is necessary that the person always limps.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And know that the hip is bandaged for fifty days, or less if it is added to or reduced too little; all this depends on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 ¶ On the healing of a patella fracture of the knee.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that a fracture of the patella rarely happens, but it is often bruised.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If it does happen to be fractured, then it is only either a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And this can occur with a wound and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 And a cast is placed over it entirely while it has feeling. ・
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 And its healing is such that the broken parts are made equal with the fingers, until they unite and join together as much as possible through equality and ease of handling.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then place a plaster made from sesame flour or wheat flour with egg white on it; and if you need one, put a round bandage over it; and bind it tightly with a suitable bandage. ・ ・
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the conditions that we have described for other fractures; such as a hot abscess and others like it; so that you may counteract every incident with what is suitable for it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 "On the repair of a broken leg.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter 17
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 You should know that the leg has two bones. One is thick and is called by the name of the leg, while the other is thin and is called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And it happens to both types of fractures that happen to the two bones of the arm, and for this reason its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 But if both bones are broken at the same time, the leg is turned towards all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is turned toward the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 And if the thicker bone is broken, it will be found lower down; and this is one of those things which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then apply traction, and reduction, and bandaging of the bones in the same manner as described before. 》
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, if the fracture of the leg is a dirty fracture with many wounds, you should make the traction less and gentler in your reduction.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And in the case of the leg, there is something different from the arm: that when you have made the bones equal and completed all your work, then take two strips of pine wood that are used for making floors, which are placed under boards, and are made from a shovel's width. Choose those that have a small thickness and are not too thin; their length should be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards. 》
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then wrap each strip with two layers of cloth along its length. 》 》
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part on one side of the leg and the other on the opposite side; they should extend from the knee to below the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then tie the two strips in three places: at both ends and in the middle. 》 》 》 》
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 When the stricture is blocked, the leg turns towards the right and left, and it stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And now indeed let a cradle be administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it may preserve it from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 And indeed it is very important to do this in a fracture when there is also a wound properly [with the fracture].
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then observe the leg every day, and study it with the utmost care against swelling or inflammation or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If therefore any of these things happen, then apply to it what is necessary until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the Fracture of the Bones of the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter Eighteen
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 Indeed, a fracture does not occur in the heel at all.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 A fracture occurs indeed in the bones of the foot and in the toes only rarely, and it does not occur in them except as a bruise in many dispositions.  ()
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see those bones being raised over each other, then let the sick person place his foot on prepared ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand and place your foot on that part which is raised from those bones; afterwards press or tread it down and make it even until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then apply a poultice and wool on top; and place under the sole of the foot a small board that has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with a decent bandage after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things that are needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 Therefore, when three or four days pass for him, then release the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones leveled out, whether they were broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 The operation on them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 But if any of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them equal as I have told you in the restoration of the hand's fingers.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place a finger-shaped splint according to the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider; then place under the foot the board I have told you about, and bind it with a decent bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 But if the broken parts are two or three or more, then place a splint of appropriate size on each finger wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the lower board under the foot: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the belly of the foot so that it may hold well in position.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 And it is fitting for you not to forget to consider all that I have said to you concerning other breaks from the injuries we mentioned: and counter each injury with what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 ¶ Concerning the break of a woman's vulva, and the bone of the pubis, and the man's penis.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit upright.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then slightly lean her back toward her own back, and let her be held from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton until it is full; and let there be in the vulva from this as if a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then let the woman be shaken, and gradually raise up her back. />
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For that cotton comes out until it is at the vulva's entrance like a sphere, and the broken part returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a small pillow behind her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 When she wants to urinate, remove the cotton with ease; then let her urinate; and put it back in the same way you first inserted it; then let her return to her original pillow.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Do this for seven days, or thereabouts, so that the wound itself may be restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take the bladder of a sheep and tie a small reed tube over its opening, then insert the entire bladder into the wound.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow through the tube with strength until the bladder inflates within the wound, for the broken bone will return to its place.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then fill it with cotton and let it remain for several days, as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the rib of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and alignment that which we have mentioned regarding the jawbone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And there is no secret in these nearby fractures that hardly touch each other, especially for those who have some knowledge or skill.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And understand this book of mine well, for the fracture itself indicates to you the correct way in its restoration and union in many arrangements; therefore, understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 But when a man's penis is broken, take the neck of a goose and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place a bandage of cloth over it and bind it, and leave it for three days or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 About the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is appropriate for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or thigh bone, or similar to that, to hasten and bleed them immediately: if the conditions of bleeding are evident to you, as we have said previously.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound bleeds, then you should hasten to cauterize it by applying powdered myrrh over it: if nothing else is available.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause bad things to happen to it.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 But if the broken bone is protruding and visible through the skin: then you should try to reduce it and make it even with your hands, using ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 But if its extension and equalization by hand are not prepared: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is the size of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And because of this it is necessary for the doctor to take from them three or four according to the size he needs for that purpose in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it does not double when pressed upon during the operation: and let its end be sharp, which has an edge at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And let its upper part be in thickness from half of it to its lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form. ›
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is necessary in this operation to place the sharp curved end of it on the protruding bone; and push it with one movement, until the bone returns and becomes even to some degree.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Try therefore to make the ends of the fracture equal to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the end of the fracture is thin and the instrument does not take it with a good grip, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If you cannot return them with what we have described, then cut it with one of the incisions that we have mentioned, or saw it with a saw in whatever way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then scrape off what remains on the bone from roughness and small shavings.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 Therefore, when the bone is reduced and the patient afterwards finds great pain that harms him, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you provide the patient with a great help, when your restoration of the bone is completed.  >
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then soak the cloth in black wine vinegar.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly if it is summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place a cheese-cloth on the wound, nor anything containing oil: lest it cause putrefaction and corruption there.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer astells at the end of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And leave the wound open: so that you make a cut with scissors in the bandages according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And take care not to bind the wound with the break.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For often foolish physicians have done this: and caused either death or corruption or zochem, that is, pus, to happen to their patients.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let your binding be soft and gentle, different from the binding of other breaks.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or is a large wound, and you fear some of the bad outcomes that we have mentioned may happen to it, and you find lingering pain in the place: then it is not right for you to put astells on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make bandages of tough cloth in place of astells and bind the wound with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 But after one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from it the cloth which you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer liniments and ointments which we are accustomed to use for treating wounds; such as the four-ingredient ointment and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it is fitting that you should loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 And consider the wound every morning and evening until it heals and is made whole.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus runs off easily.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 But if many days have passed and the wound has not healed, nor has the pus been discharged from it; then you should know that there are small splinters of bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, it is necessary to explore the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 However many of those splinters are separated out, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those that are not separated and prick the flesh, causing pain, try to cut them out and remove them in every way possible for you to do so.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 But if the wound should become inflamed or have pustules, that is, suppuration, or another sign of corruption and putrefaction; then you must apply to each of them that which is appropriate for treating it, as has been described before in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And concerning what I have said and to which you should give your attention: when a bone is broken and protrudes from the flesh, such as the thighbone or hipbone, and similar large bones; it is that you should not attempt to reduce it, for many times death occurs from this; rather leave it alone until it becomes putrid.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 For perhaps it may fall out on its own after twenty days or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then, if it seems to you that the wound is healing, take care of it; but if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 ¶ On treating a swelling at the site of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	 **Chapter 21.**
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 Multiple times this swelling occurs during the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Especially when it is near a joint: and from this configuration the shape of the limb becomes ugly.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore, if the swelling is recent, apply to it medicines that have an astringent effect, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, scammony, acacia, and similar substances.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Thus, take some or all of these substances and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or vinegar. And place them on the swelling on wool, and bind them well on the swelling itself. xspace
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And leave the binding in place; do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then release it, and repeat another one, until the swelling is removed. xspace
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or bind a lead plate neatly over it.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing anything feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 But if the swelling has already turned into a hard mass and requires immediate removal, then cut open its top part and cut away the prominent excess: or scrape it with some scrapers until it is removed; and care for it until it heals. xspace 
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 ¶ On the treatment when a limb is restored but remains thin and not according to its natural shape.
Caput XXII.	 **Chapter 22.**
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture is restored and the limb remains thin and weak afterwards, this occurs only for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of these reasons is the frequent loosening and tightening of the ligaments not as it should be, or because of an excessively tight binding of the ligaments, which prevents nourishment from reaching the limb; or because of an excessive amount of ointment applied at the wrong time; or because of a deficiency of blood in the patient's body and his weakness.  xspace
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 And its treatment is to feed the patient and make his body soft until the blood increases in him.
Et administra balneum.	 And apply a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And introduce joy and happiness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the member, so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And continue its embrocation with warm water until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 § On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When a member already restored after its healing has a crookedness or prominence in the broken bone, or knotting, and the form of the member is disfigured by it, yet the member does not prevent its natural operation, then one should not accept the opinion of someone who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And indeed there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who did this in our land. ➤
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 And this operation is very blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, as if it were fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 But if the limping and knotting are recent, then it is necessary that an embrocation be made with warm water in which have been boiled softening herbs, such as althea leaves and its root, and melilot, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And a plaster should be made for him with softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or the mucilage of the althea root should be shaken with chicken fat or sesame oil, and it should be plastered with it. ➤
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or take ripe figs and grind them with dove dung and similar substances that are called in the medicines as ones that decrease hardening.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes the knotting is dissolved with constant, old, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And let motion be applied to every limb in every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 But if the tortuosity has already taken hold and become strong, and turned into a hard mass requiring surgical intervention: then it is necessary to cut through it from above, and sever the bone's continuity with thin incisors; and ease should be applied to it with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 On Speech Regarding Dislocation
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Therefore, it is prevented from moving and the figure of the limb is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes severe pain and injuries to afflict the patient.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 Therefore, when someone experiences a dislocation, it is necessary to hasten for its restoration and not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if it is delayed, the site becomes swollen, and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation as well.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Because of this, it should not be moved or extended during the hour of its swelling.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Since often it causes cramp and painful injuries to occur.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 However, when this occurs, then it is necessary for you to hasten to bleed the patient.  /> Nam sic fit, ut restauretur dislocatio in eo tempore, et non perducit in nephritidem.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it should be left alone until the swelling subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And every part of the limb should be scraped, as much as is remembered to return to its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation even as it was discussed previously in the section on fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.  /> Et secundum ordinem locorum, et secundum quod est necessarium.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 ¶ On the Care of Dislocated Lower Jaw
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two jaws are seldom dislocated except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And the dislocation of both occurs according to two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 For either they are moved from their places by a slight removal and are softened briefly.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or they are dislocated by complete dislocation until they soften to the chest part, until the patient's saliva runs, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue rolls with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 However, when its dislocation is slight, then it returns by itself in many positions with little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary to administer its reduction quickly and not delay it at all: and it is as if the attendant holds the head of the patient, and the physician inserts his thumb of one hand into the root of the jaw between his teeth, if the dislocation is from one side. 
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or he inserts both thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the remaining fingers of his hands are outside, with which he pushes evenly.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And instruct the patient to clean his jaws and open them fully as if to eat. 
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the physician pushes the jaw evenly and presses it until it returns to its place.  
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are together; then administer fomentation with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy; do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 Therefore, when they return and are leveled, and the patient's mouth is closed and does not soften; then place upon them small pieces of cloth, with a compress made from wax and rose oil.   
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it should be tied with ease using soft ligatures.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And let the patient sleep on his back; and his head should be upright between two cushions, so that it does not move to the right or left; nor should he attempt, or be forced, to chew anything; rather, let his food be a gentle sipping until, when the pains are removed, and the jaw is fixed, then he may eat what he wishes, and it should be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 He should not exert himself over the surgery of his mouth while eating and drinking and swallowing, until the jaw is fixed and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 But if the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their proper places, then fevers and continuous sweats often occur from this, and perhaps the patient’s stomach will loosen, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 Therefore, when you see this happening, know that it is a loss, and often the patient dies from it within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 ¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the end of the upper arm.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 Indeed, the collarbone is not dislocated from inside the side due to its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And it sometimes dislocates outwardly, and this is apparent to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 Its restoration is done as follows: let the patient lie on his back, and stretch out his arms. ›
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then strongly press down on the place with your palm, for it will return by itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then apply a plaster and cushions to it, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, its ends which follow the elbow and are connected with it, do not become dislocated, except rarely. › ›
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 But if it is dislocated on some day, then it must be reduced and set according to what we have said and prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place upon it a plaster, pills, and a bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And bid the patient to adhere to rest and quiet until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same treatment the end of the arm is reduced when it has also been separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 ¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the shoulder cannot be dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One of which is that it may be dislocated towards the lower part of the axilla. 
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second way is for it to be dislocated towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it may be dislocated towards the upper part of the arm, which happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it cannot be dislocated towards the back, because of the glenoid cavity.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it cannot be dislocated towards the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 And most often it is indeed dislocated and exits towards the lower part of the axilla; especially in those whose flesh is scant.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because in them it exits quickly and returns quickly.  
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, for it exits with difficulty and returns with difficulty. 
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps in some people, a blow or a fall occurs and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, and it is thought on account of that, because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, you should test that until you stand upon the certainty of it, and then proceed to its treatment.  
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 And a dislocation is known when it is towards the lower part of the axilla; and you should distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you will find between them a manifest difference, and in the head of the shoulder there is a concavity, and under the axilla when touched it feels as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear nor move it in all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And likewise, if it is dislocated toward the chest or upward, then you will find a clear touch, and it will not be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent or if the boy is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 And its reduction is that the assistant should raise his hand upward.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs under his nipple, and lift the joint with strength upward to its place: and the assistant should raise his hand and extend it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then let him place it below, for it will return quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 But if it does not return through what has been said, and many days have passed since the dislocation first occurred, then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in warm water and be given an infusion that softens and soothes, such as boiling althea root, fenugreek, and melilot in water and administering it.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then let the patient be laid on his back, and place under his nipple a ball of wool that is equally balanced between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then let the physician place his heel on the ball, and lift the head of the humerus with strength, and pull the patient's hand downward.  />  />  />  />
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another assistant should hold the head of the patient so that it does not move downward; for it will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is that you should have present a man who is taller than the patient, and let him stand on the side, and insert his humerus under the patient's nipple; and lift the patient's nipple upward until the patient is suspended in the air.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another assistant should pull the patient's hand downward toward his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 But if the patient is light, then it is necessary to hang something with him so that he becomes heavier; for the dislocation will return immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it can also be reduced by another method: and that is to fix a long piece of wood into the ground, with a rounded head like the top of a mortar, not too thick, nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then, after placing the patient on top of the head of the wood, soft cloths should be put under the patient along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then his hand should be extended downward on one side and his body should be pulled in the opposite direction with strength, for the dislocation returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If its reduction is difficult by all the means we have mentioned, then use this method: and that is to take a piece of wood whose length is equal to two arms, and whose width is equal to four fingers, and whose thickness is equal to two fingers; it should have a rounded head to facilitate its insertion deep into the ear canal, as shown in this figure.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then soft cloths should be tied over the rounded head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then it should be placed under the patient's ear, so that the hand or arm can be extended over the wood until it reaches below; and the wood should be tied to an assistant, the arm, and the tip of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then the arm should be placed on a step of a ladder according to its width, and the hand should be extended downward, and the rest of the body should be left hanging on the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For the dislocation returns immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Therefore, when its passage is completed by whatever possible method, then it is necessary to place a woolen sphere of equal size under the ear.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then apply a plaster prepared from millstone powder and frankincense with egg white over the entire shoulder, as shown in the figure above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then tie a proper bandage under the ear and roll the bandage over the plaster as shown above; and fasten his hand to his own neck, and leave it there without moving his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 And it is necessary that the food of the sick person be scarce, until the limb is strengthened; because it is swifter for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then let more [food] be given after seven days or five, and let it be consumed with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 Therefore, if it becomes firm and does not soften, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If, however, the joint is dislocated many times, either because of the moisture that affects it or for another reason, then it is necessary to apply a three-pronged cautery to it, as has been said previously in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If all this is done and the ligament is released after seven days and the joint does not firm up, and the plaster and stricture are repeatedly applied to it but do not become firm, and fall off, and cannot be raised upwards; then know that the nerves which are at the head of the shoulder have already been cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never become fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 But a dislocation which occurs towards the chest and breast or back is restored with pushing and extending by hand until it returns, and then the rest of the plaster and care are administered to it until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If, after healing, there is heaviness in the limb and slowness of movement, then let the sick person use baths many times until that heaviness is lessened and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 ¶ On the Treatment of Elbow Dislocation
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty; indeed it can be dislocated in all directions, especially anteriorly or posteriorly.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And its dislocation is not hidden from you; for it falls under sight and touch, in whatever form it may be dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 For the joint will be drawn together, and it cannot double the arm nor touch its own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And you must hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess develops in it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if a hot abscess develops in it, the reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For it is worse than all other types of dislocations and causes more intense pain for them; and death often comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the restoration of it when it is among those that can be reduced is to extend its hand with two hands: and let its arm be stretched out, and the doctor's hands be above the elbow and below it, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or if the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns by doubling its hand with his own hand, until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the root of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not obey in its reduction, then administer a very strong and forceful extension; and it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should also hold him so that he cannot move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm should be rolled to all parts after a double-length cloth or a wide bandage is wrapped around its hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil: so that it is among those things that help in the smoothness of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he should push the joint with a strong thrust until it returns. 》
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 And after its reduction it is necessary to place a poultice on it, which contains astringency and drying with the white of an egg; and let it be bound with a proper bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And let the arm be hung from the neck of the sick person; and leave it for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then untie it.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If then the joint is strengthened in its place, then untie the bandage from it and leave it alone.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see that the joint is not well tightened, then repeat the plaster and the bandage, and leave it alone for some days until it is tightened.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then untie it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 But if heaviness happens to it after the reduction of the joint and the arrangement is in motion: then apply moistening with bathing, fine friction, and compression until it becomes lined, or place on the joint liliatum, that is, the fatty tail of a ram.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then let it be bound, and leave it on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it, and put him into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When he sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then repeat over it liliatum once, and a second time, and a third with entering the bath, until it is relieved.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place over it fresh cow dung, moistened and heated with butter, and bind it over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 For it is soothed, and returns to its own state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 ¶ On the treatment of dislocation according to Al-Zahrawi.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 The small finger of the hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 And its reduction is easy.  />
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 Unlike other joints.  />  \\
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place becomes swollen; or a hot swelling occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of the dislocation in it is that you place a Mahassem on the infirm hand on a board, and let the assistant extend his hand; and let the doctor place his palm over the prominence of the joint, and press it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it should be considered whether the palm has already receded to the abdomen of the hand; then let the patient place the back of his hand on the board for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be internally on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the board so that the doctor's hand falls upon the very prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 Therefore, if it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster that draws out the swelling, and leave it, do not move it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if he does not tolerate it and you are unable to accomplish the reduction after some days have passed, although the joint remains according to its own twist, and nothing harms the patient except that his hand becomes soft and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves have been cut or damaged.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 There is no skill in this, except to bind it with a hot iron near its injury.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps that does not help at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 Therefore, when the Almahassem does not return, then place upon it the plaster which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then let it be bound and left for five days; afterwards let it be unbound and left, and the hand should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 But if its motion is hindered and something heavy happens to it, then soften it with warm water and frequent rubbing until it is soothed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 About the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When one of the fingers is dislocated in any direction, or when a finger is dislocated to the back of the palm or its abdomen, then extend the finger and press on the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then support the head of the finger and hang it towards the side to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then suspend it and extend it until it straightens on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it is night, bind it according to the account itself; and do not cease unbinding it during the day; and exercise it with movement; and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do this for several days until it tightens.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; and bind it to that part, and perform your first procedure with it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And do the same with it when it is dislocated in other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 ¶ About the treatment of the dislocation of the back vertebrae.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When someone has a complete dislocation of the back or neck vertebrae, or many vertebrae are moved from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death hastens to the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of this is that the sick person's excretion comes out involuntarily, and he cannot control it; and often some of his limbs are paralyzed from it, or both his legs, or both his arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is moved from its place.  />
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For often they are moved, because often their removal happens in four parts.  />
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 That which is moved to the back is called humpbackedness.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 But its cure is that you should consider then, if the humpbackedness happened from childhood; then there is no cure for it, and there is absolutely no healing from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in that which happens by chance, or by a blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken about methods of cure at length.  />  />  />  />
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 Whose benefit is least.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 But I have already shortened it from that [version] whose inadequacy is excused by its closeness to me and my intention and exposition which I used and made the instrument in a different way than they showed and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say that in a hump which occurs from the front part, there is no cure or healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in one which forms on both sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured by them, except the one which occurs in the back properly, as I will narrate: and it is to extend the sick person on his face on a level platform near the wall; and to spread moist straw under him so that his chest is not hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then a straight stick fixed in a hole in the ground should be placed at the end of the platform near his head; and another stick near his feet at the other end of the platform; and an assistant should hold the stick and it should not be firmly fixed in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And another assistant should hold the other [stick].
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then roll [the bandage] over the head of the sick person and under his chin tie a soft but strong ligature; and extend the end of the ligature to the stick which is near his head, and tie it on that.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then bind another ligature above his ankles, and above his knees, and near his groin.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the ligatures together and tie them on the other stick which is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then let each assistant pull on his portion of the ligature toward the stick and the two sticks should not be moved from their places where they are fixed; however, they should not be firmly fixed, as we said.  />  Deinde extendat minister ut supra, et trahat infirmum per medium scapulas eius ad dorsum eius; et sic debebit curari.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the physician should place his hands on the spondyl with strength until he returns; or he should place a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he attaches his feet to the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If he does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And hollow out in the wall we spoke of, which is near the patient, a place into which the end of the board can enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle of the board on the pillow.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And let the physician place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And he should bind it well until it constricts the pillow and then return to his place. 》
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then if you wish, work with a lathe that is operated by hand; and it should be such that you fix in the ground near the head of the patient, at the end of the bed, two wooden stakes whose length is one cubit each: and also two wooden stakes at his head, at the end of the bed.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the distance between each stake be one handbreadth: and now a hole has been made in every place through which the lathe can run; and let all the wood be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And insert a round wooden rod; and this is the lathe on which the bandage is wound between the two holes of the two stakes.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at its end is a hole into which the wood, whose length is one handbreadth with what is wound around it, is fixed; and similarly on the two other stakes.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then bind the bandages that you have bound on the patient's chest with the lathe at his head; and the bandages that you have bound on his legs with the lathe at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then let there be an assistant standing by each lathe who turns his hand with the winding cord by which the lathe is wound; and the physician adjusts the pillow according to what we have said. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of a lathe, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then, after the return of the lathe and the place is leveled, it is necessary to put on a desiccating plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then straw.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then place on top of the plaster a little plate of wood whose width is three fingers or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length should be such that it fits the swollen place and extends over the healthy part of the lathe.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then let it be bound with the bandage mentioned earlier.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And let the patient use a light diet until he is cured.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If any swelling remains in the place at the end of the treatment, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines for a long time together with the application of the board we have described.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now lead is applied on that plate.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 And sometimes a swelling occurs in the last vertebra of the back; and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, one should not presume to treat it with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 ¶ On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the shoulder never occur except as a dislocation, nor does what happens to other joints through slight separation and concavity happen to them. 
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 And indeed, the ankle joint can be dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 That is, because it can be dislocated forward and backward.   
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 And the ankle joint is most commonly dislocated inward, and rarely outward or backward.        
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 And the treatment for its inward dislocation is this: because when you join the healthy leg of the patient with his sick one, it is longer; and his knee protrudes more than the healthy one, and he cannot bend his foot at the groin; and there is a swelling in the place following the groin, because the head of the thigh bone has already arrived there.                        
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 And the sign that it has happened on the outside is that its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 And the sign that it has happened on the front is that it extends the healthy leg to its full length; however, it cannot double it without pain in the knee. And if it tries to walk, it cannot step over it to the front, and its urine is retained, and an inguinal swelling appears, and during walking there is a stepping on its heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 And the sign that it has happened on the back is that it does not extend the knee nor can it double it before doubling the groin. And its leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and there is swelling at the place of the hip bone.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of these kinds of dislocations is, to consider then, if the dislocation is old and has already begun to heal in the patient.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you administer its reduction and it remains according to its position, then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, it should not be presumed upon completely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 But in the one whose dislocation is recent and is from one of the four kinds of dislocations, then hurry to do this: roll the joint and extend it to the inside and outside, and move it to the right and left; perhaps it will return and not need any other care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 But if it does not return this way, then a strong helper should be prepared and extend his leg from the lower part; either with his hands or with a ligament that is tied over his leg above the knee. And another helper extends his hand over it, so that he inserts his hands under its armpits. 
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then bind it with a gentle ligature over the hip joint, and hold the end of another ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And its extension should be from the front of the groin to the collarbone, or from behind to the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And let their extension be all in one go, until the patient is lifted off the ground with his body, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 And this type of extension is a common type among four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then each type must be treated according to its own specific method of healing.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the proper reduction of it when the dislocation is inward, one must make the patient lie on his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then place a ligature over the hip joint, between the head of the thigh and the place that is under the groin. 》 》
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the ligature upward from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the collarbone.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then another strong assistant should take hold of his arms, and reduce the thickened part of the dislocated hip with a violent extension outward.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now it has returned to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this method is the easiest of all the methods for reducing this limb. 》
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 But if the dislocation remains stubborn and does not submit to this method of treatment, then it is necessary that both feet of the patient be bound together with a strong ligature over both heels and both knees; and let each ligature have a length of four fingerbreadths from its companion; and let the infirm leg be extended by more than one and a half times the length.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then let the patient be suspended over the head of a beam that is in the house; and let its length from the ground be two arm's lengths.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong young man to support the head of the thigh; and let another young man be suspended with the patient; and let another young man push, supporting the thigh with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly. 》
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In its own proper reduction, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary for the patient to lie on a table, as we have narrated regarding the hunchbacked person.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And let the ligament be tightened above his leg, properly, and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one by his feet, and the other by his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then let an additional piece of wood be placed in the middle of the table, fixed well, upon which moistened cloths may be wound, so that it does not harm the patient: and let the wood be between his thighs, so that it is not drawn downwards during the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then let each assistant pull towards his side, and the physician shall equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If therefore it submits to the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place another table on top of it and press it evenly, as we have said regarding the hunchbacked condition.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, it is necessary for the patient to lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary for the leg of the patient to be extended quickly: and this is according to the same account on the table: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand over the groin of the patient.  />
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then let him compress it with the other hand, and with that compression place the leg extended downwards towards the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 And if the dislocation is to the back, then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended downwards, but rather he should be raised off the ground; nay, it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is also necessary if his ankle is dislocated to the outside, according to what we have said regarding his lying on two ankles: and this is face down with the ligaments extended, as we have recently said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And it is necessary that a compress be applied with a board also on the place from which the joint exits, when the reduction is completed as it should be.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its reduction will not be hidden from you; and it is that you stretch out the two legs of the patient: and when you see them equal, and the patient tightens his leg and extends it without hesitation: then know that the limb has already returned as it should: then join the two thighs, and put on a poultice, and bind with a bandage, which is, a splint: thus, so that no joint moves to any part: and let the patient adhere to rest for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then release the bandage and poultice, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation is now fixed: so dismiss the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see any swelling: then return, and poultice it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then release it and make the patient delay walking on both legs for some days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 ¶ On Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee can be dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated to the outer side, to the inner side, and to the lower side, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it does not dislocate to the front. ‌
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to apply his leg to his thigh. ‌ ‌
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If it does not stick with the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all ways of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he can already extend his leg over it if he can, and press your back against his face; and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then press his knee with your palms, and stretch them between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply both sides of his knee with your palm strongly.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another assistant should extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres to the hip gently, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then bandage it, and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind them together with a band for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then unbind them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And the patient should not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If the reduction is refused by you, then apply strong traction with ligaments, as has been mentioned previously in the treatment of the ankle, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 ¶ On the treatment of the dislocation of the heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel is sometimes moved by a slight displacement and sometimes dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 And its dislocation occurs either to the inner or outer side.  />
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding towards the side to which it has been displaced.  />  />
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The treatment of its slight displacement is an easy reduction: and it is to stretch it gently with the hands and pull until it returns.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 In the treatment of it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary to make the patient sit upright; and let a strong assistant hold him very firmly from behind his back, in its middle part.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold with your right hand the upper part of his foot and with your left hand the lower part of his foot in the place of the heel.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 "Then with the left hand two times.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 "Then extend with the left hand, and press the breast of the foot with the right hand towards the shin without difficulty.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 "Do that twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 "Then press the breast of the foot towards the shin a third time, and you pull out the tendon.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 "If then it returns in one time or two according to this manner, and you see the foot even, it is good. And if not, then repeat the operation on him, because he will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 "But if you are prevented from bringing it back as we have said, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and drive a stake into the ground very firmly, so that it falls between his thighs; and you have already rolled a cloth over him, so that it does not hurt the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 "Then let the assistant take hold of his thigh; afterwards, let the other assistant extend the foot, either with his hands or with a bandage that he binds around the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 "Then let every assistant pull against the extension of his companion; and the stake shall stand between the two thighs of the patient, holding him so that his body is not drawn downwards during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 "Then let the physician equalize the dislocation with his hands, and the other assistant shall hold the healthy leg below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 "For the dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 "When therefore the dislocation returns and its soundness is made clear to you, then place a poultice and wool, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot to the shin with a bandage.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 "And you must be careful or fearful of the nerves which are above the heel at the back, lest there be a tight bandage over them and they injure them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 "Then leave him for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the sinew is softened, bind it; then release it on the third or fourth day, and prevent the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 But if he attempts to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not dissolve and be destroyed, so that afterward he may not receive healing.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 But if he develops a hot abscess, then it is necessary that you administer to him the substance previously mentioned in our treatise on healing, and apply a poultice until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 On the Dislocation of the Toes and its Treatment
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary to straighten what has been dislocated among them with a slight extension without difficulty; indeed this is not difficult but easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the foot's back, then it is necessary for the patient to sit with his foot on a level surface or on a board, and he should stand as if walking. ️
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you should stand, and place your foot on the part that protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then step on it with your foot with strength until it returns and you see it has been straightened, and no protrusion appears in that place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then place under his foot a board that fits the entire foot, which has two handles.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind it with a decent bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then release it, and make him refrain from walking for many days until the joint is bound and securely healed.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 On the Types of Dislocations with Wounds or Fractures
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVII. ️
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something like this happens and you attempt to heal it and restore it, death often results; therefore, one should not undertake the healing of such a case unless he is skilled in the art with long experience, merciful, pious, cautious, not rash or presumptuous: and that he use at the beginning medicines which only suppress hot abscesses: and leave the patient to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for health from destruction with gentleness of illness, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Try, therefore, to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the member returns as we wish, then administer a treatment that settles the abscess, and care for the wound with one of the drying ointments suitable to it.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 But if the dislocation is with fracture, and separate fragments occur in the bone, then try to remove them, and do what we have said about simple diseases from that which precedes in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be careful according to your strength, and keep yourself from entering the way of fear; just as my teaching has gone before you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and safer for your body among those at your time.
