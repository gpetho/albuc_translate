Chapter Twenty-Six on Reducing a Dislocated Shoulder
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways, one of which is that it dislocates downwards towards the armpit
and the second is that it dislocates towards the chest
and sometimes it dislocates upwards above the shoulder, and that is rare
and it does not dislocate backwards because of the scapula
and it does not dislocate forwards because of the nerves
And it mostly dislocates and comes out downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, because it comes out quickly and goes in quickly in them
But as for those who have much flesh, it is the opposite of that, I mean that it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty
And sometimes a person experiences a blow or a fall, and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, so it is thought that it has dislocated, so it is necessary to examine it until you ascertain its truth, and then proceed with its treatment
The dislocation is recognized, if it is downwards towards the armpit, if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the healthy shoulder, for you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the shoulder with a curvature, and under the armpit, upon touching, the head of the shoulder is like an egg, and the patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear, nor to move it in all movements
Likewise, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find that obvious to the touch, not hidden
This dislocation may be easy to reduce if it is fresh or if the patient is a child
Its reduction is that an assistant raises his hand upwards, then you place your two thumbs under his armpit, and lift the joint forcefully upwards to its place, and the assistant raises his hand and extends it upwards, then lowers it downwards, and it will return quickly
If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been there for many days, then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in hot water and to use the emollient that softens and relaxes, such as cooking marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water and using it
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool that is moderate between soft and firm, then the physician places his heel on the ball, and holds the patient's hand with his hand, and extends it downwards, and pushes the ball with his foot, and it will return to its place
And if you wish, reduce it in this way, which is that you bring a man taller than the patient and have him stand by the side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lifts his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another assistant pulls the patient's hand down to his lower abdomen, and if the patient is light, then it is necessary to hang something else on him to weigh him down, and the dislocation will return immediately
It may also be reduced in another way, which is to fix a long piece of wood in the ground, the top of which is round like the bottom of a mortar, neither thick nor thin, then it is placed under the patient's armpit after you place a soft cloth on the top of the wood, and the patient is standing along the wood, then you extend his hand downwards from the other side, and he also extends his body from the other side with force, and the joint will return to its place quickly
If its reduction is difficult by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment, which is to take a piece of wood about two cubits long, four fingers wide, and two fingers thick, with a rounded head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit, in this way:
Then soft rags are tied on the rounded head so that the wood does not harm the patient.
Then it is placed under the armpit and the entire hand and arm are extended on the wood downwards, and the wood is tied on the upper arm, forearm, and the edge of the hand.
Then the arm is placed horizontally on the rung of a ladder and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side, for the joint will enter immediately.
Once it has entered, by whatever means possible, a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared poultice of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is carried on the entire shoulder as it rotates from above.
Then the ball is tightened firmly from under the armpit, and it is rotated with the bandage on the poultice from above, and his hand is hung to his neck, and he is left without moving his hand for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's food be made little until the limb strengthens, for it is faster for his recovery.
Then it is loosened after seven or five days, and he is trained in movement, and if it is stable and does not relax, then he has recovered.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture affecting it or another ailment, then it is necessary to use cauterization with the three needles as mentioned previously in the chapter on cauterization.
If you have done all of this, and loosened the bandage after seven days and the joint did not stabilize, and you repeated the poultice and tightening on it several times, and it did not stabilize and fell and relaxed, and you were unable to raise it upwards, then know that its nerve in the head of the shoulder has been severed, or stretched, or relaxed.
Then know that the joint will never be stable in its place.
As for the dislocation that is towards the chest and breast and backwards, its reduction is by pushing and extending with the hands until it returns.
And all the tightening and treatment is used on it until it heals.
If after healing there appears a stiffness in the limb and slowness in movement, then let the patient use the bath frequently until that stiffness softens and it returns to its original state.
