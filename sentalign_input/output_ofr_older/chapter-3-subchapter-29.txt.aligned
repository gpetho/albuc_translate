Of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand	On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.	0.6362108
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated in all directions, sometimes on the back of the palm or the front.	The fingers may be dislocated in any direction.	0.5433371
Then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the tip of the finger, and hang it towards the side where it is dislocated.	When one of the fingers is dislocated dorsally or ventrally, then extend the finger and thrust the dislocation with your thumb until it goes back. Then bind the head of the phalanx, suspending it in the direction in which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days.	0.68902224
And leave it for two days, then set it properly that day; and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and rebind it at night; and do this often until it is stable.	Then unbind it and extend it so that it may straighten out all that day. Then at nightfall bind it in just the same way. Continue to loosen it by day and to exercise it with movement, bandaging it by night. Do this for some days until it is knit.	0.76808023
And do the same if it is dislocated to the front of the hand, and do as you did before until it is healed; and do the same when it is dislocated elsewhere.	Do the same with it if it is a ventral dislocation, binding it in that direction, and treat it as explained above until it is healed. Do likewise with dislocations in other directions.	0.7145295
