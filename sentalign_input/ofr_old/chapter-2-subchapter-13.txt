About the rot of the eye
When this disease called "aleacrati" or rot comes to the eye, there are two types: one natural, and the other unnatural. And it occurs by the healing of a wound, or by cutting or cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of the procedure is that you cut that adhesion, and separate the lips of it, and place linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed; and you must not use in the treatment of it any drying and constricting substances. For if you do this, the disease will return worse than before; but treat it with softening substances, such as fenugreek; and sprinkle it with water or mallow and linseed cooked, and dyacylon ointment melted in some oils, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with this.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you take care that it does not heal in the same form as before; and this procedure that we have mentioned is only for addressing this disease, so that it does not return in the same form as before.
