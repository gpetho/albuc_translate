And it should be sharp on both sides. with a point, and yet not so penetrating that it could reach the intestine when inserted, and could injure it; then see if the dropsy/edema is generated towards the intestines: you must cut above the navel three fingers directly below the xiphoid process; and if the dropsy/edema is due to liver disease, let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers; and if it is due to the spleen, let it be to the right, and the patient must not lie on the incision so that the excess fluids do not flow to that weak spot; then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and insert it, and lift your hand with the whole scalpel between the skin and the superficial fascia as if skinning to the width of a fingernail or thereabouts; then pierce the superficial fascia until the scalpel reaches the empty space, and this is the location of the water, then withdraw it, and insert this instrument of which this is the form: And it is similar to a thin silver tube, and it is made of brass or light bronze, and has at the lower part a small hole; and on the side on one part, three holes; and two on the other part, and one on the other; and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribe cuts the pen:	Moreover, the incision must not be on the side which the patient wishes to lie on, so that the superfluities may not flow to the damaged part. Then pierce the skin with the instrument, introduce the instrument into that incision, and bring the scalpel up between the skin and the membrane, as if excoriating, over an area about the size of a fingernail. Then pierce through the membrane till the scalpel reaches a cavity, which will be where the water is; then withdraw the scalpel and put into the opening the instrument shaped like this; it resembles a fine section of reed, made of silver, bronze or white copper; smooth and well polished, with a small opening at the lower end and three at the sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see. Its extremity may be cut to the shape of a writing reed like this; the upper end of it is supplied with a ring.	0.90790904
And if you are worried about the patient, and you leave a lot of water, then treat them with burial in warm sand, and with a lot of sweating or baths and in the sun, and let them abstain from drinking; and treat them with drying medicines until they are healed, and cauterize over the stomach and over the liver and over the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.	And do this daily, watchful and on guard against error, until there is only a trace of fluid left. But if you are afraid for the patient and leave a large amount of fluids treat him by burying him in hot sand, and by heavy sweating in the bath and in the sun, and letting him go thirsty; while you treat him with drying medicines, till he is well. He should also be cauterized on the abdomen and on the liver and spleen after the paracentesis, as I have previously described.	0.89223707
