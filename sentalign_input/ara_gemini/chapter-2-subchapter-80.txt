Chapter eighty on the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part (of the body).
Fistulas that occur in the lower part of the body are a thickening and hardening that occurs near the anus from the outside or in the perineum from one of the sides, and the fistula may be single or multiple.
If this thickening becomes chronic, it opens and a watery white fluid or thin pus flows from it, and some of these fistulas may penetrate to the anus and to the intestine, and some may not be penetrating.
The penetrating ones can be recognized by the feces and gas that come out of them when the patient defecates, and sometimes worms come out of them.
And some of these fistulas, if they are in the perineum, may penetrate to the bladder and to the urethra, and some of them may penetrate to the hip joint and to the coccyx.
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating to the anus from a non-penetrating one is that you insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the fistula, made of copper or iron if the fistula is not curved. If it is curved, then insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it until you feel the probe or the hair in your finger.
If you do not feel it at all, and nothing of feces, gas, or worms comes out of the hole, as we have said, then know that it is not penetrating, so proceed with the treatment.
And if the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urethra, the evidence for this is the exit of urine from it and its resistance to healing with medicines.
And if it penetrates to the hip joint or to the coccyx, the sign of this is the arrival of the probe there, if there is no curvature to the bone, and the presence of pain in that area, and the constant discharge of pus from it, and that no treatment is effective on it, and it does not heal with ointment.
All these penetrating fistulas are incurable, and their treatment is a futile effort for those ignorant doctors who attempt to treat them.
As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, there is hope for their healing with iron, as I will describe and as I have experienced.
This is that you lay the patient before you on his back and raise his legs up and his thighs inclined towards his abdomen, then you insert the copper or lead probe if there is curvature in the fistula until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus. If you feel in your finger that the probe has penetrated by itself, exposed, without feeling any peritoneum or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating, so do not bother with it, for it is incurable, as we have said.
And they have said that it heals in some people rarely.
And among the treatments that are hoped to be beneficial is that you heat a thin cautery iron according to the width of the fistula, as mentioned before, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches near the anus, then repeat it two or three times until you know that all the excess thickened flesh that resembles the tube of a bird's feather has been burned. Then treat it with wicks soaked in fat until the burned flesh comes out, then treat it with healing ointments. If it heals, then good, otherwise it will never heal with any other treatment.
But if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger that is in the anus, and there is a thick barrier of flesh or peritoneum between it and the probe, and you see the fistula next to the surface of the skin, then incise the skin from the beginning of the fistula while you pass through the incision with the probe while it is in the fistula until you reach the incision where the tip of the probe ends, and the probe is released and falls out.
Then clean out the thickened flesh that resembles the tube of a bird's feather, leaving nothing of it, then treat it with healing ointments until it heals.
If the bleeding overcomes you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, then the best thing you can do and the quickest benefit is to cauterize it with fire or with a strong medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that excess flesh, stopping the bleeding, and drying the moisture. Then treat it with wicks soaked in fat or powdered sulfur with oil until the area suppurates and the burned flesh comes out in the pus.
Then treat the wound with healing ointments that generate solid flesh, which are medicines that have astringency and dryness. For if it heals, it is cured, and do not fear recurrence.
If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the anus and search with it. If you feel the probe and there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh between you and it, and it is close to penetrating, then the action in it is only by way of hope and expectation, and that is to use one of three methods in it:
Either cauterize it as we have said,
or incise it until you reach its bottom to be able to insert the wicks and treatment closely, and do not go too far with the incision so as not to cut the muscle surrounding the anus, causing the patient to have involuntary defecation. Then treat it with what we have mentioned, and perhaps it will heal, as we have said,
or penetrate that barrier and pierce it after incising it near the anus, as we have said, either with the probe or with another sharp-tipped instrument. Then clean all the thickened flesh in the incision as far as you can thoroughly. Then close the entire wound with the incision and the upper opening until it seals, and leave the fistula open inside the anus, so it will be easier for the patient.
And the fistula may be perforated in this manner: if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is on the side of the anus towards the surface of the body with the skin and the rim of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a cobbler's needle in this way:
And insert into it a twisted thread of five threads or so.
Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom.
If it is perforated in the edge of the anus from inside nearby, then bring the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and bring out the end of the thread and gather both ends together and tighten them and leave it for a day or two.
Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads is cut and falls off.
Then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the opening of the fistula is not perforated, then perforate it however you can, unless it is very deep, then you should not do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it.
Then do with it as we mentioned until it heals.
The image of the hooked scalpel with which fistulas are incised, its curvature is very sharp and the other side is not sharp so that you do not cut with it what is not needed, as you see.
