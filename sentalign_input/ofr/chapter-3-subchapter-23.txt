Here begins the book of dislocations
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is deformed, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When a dislocation happens to someone, it must be reduced immediately without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it can only be put back in place with difficulty;
therefore it should not be moved at the time when it is swollen:
often it causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, have the patient bled, then leave it alone until the swelling has subsided;
then bathe the limb with hot water and oil, then reset it gently, and treat each limb as the treatment comes to its place. 
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head down to the feet.
