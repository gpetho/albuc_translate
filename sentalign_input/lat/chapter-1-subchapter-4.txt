On the method of cauterizing for an old hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When you treat hemicrania using the preceding treatment we mentioned and what we described in the divisions of ailments, and the treatment is ineffective, and you see from the illness that what we said about the initial cautery with medicine or with fire is not enough, then you should heat the knife-shaped cautery until it turns white, after marking the area of pain with a line about half a finger’s length or close to that; place your hand down once, and press it until you cut into the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to avoid the area of the jaw joint, which moves during chewing, to avoid burning the side or the nerve that controls it, lest spasm result.
And be cautious and careful regarding the blood flow from the artery that is severed.
For there is danger in its cutting, especially for one who does not know what he is doing and is neither diligent nor experienced, and abandons the procedure at the first difficulty.
And I will address the regulation of blood flow that may occur from the artery in its own proper method and place in this book.
But if you see from the illness that this cautery is insufficient for him, and you see that the patient’s body can tolerate the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, apply the cautery we described in the chapter on artery extraction, using a cautery with two blades.
For this cauterization is better than this one and more effective.
