On the treatment of the unperforated anus of the child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which have a thin and obstructed membrane.
Then the midwife should pierce that membrane with her finger; if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula, and be careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will be obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And if obstruction of the anus occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then that consolidation should be incised, and then treated with what we have said about treatment and lead.
