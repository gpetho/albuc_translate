After I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is the last of medical science with its completion, and have reached its end through its expositions and its explanations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Because manual operation has been neglected in our region and in our time, completely forgotten, until perhaps its science perished and its trace was cut off, and there remained of it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered; and error and hesitation have befallen them, until their intentions have been obscured, and their force has been weakened.  It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this treatise according to the way of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation; and that I should come with the forms of cautery instruments and other surgical instruments, when it is done by the addition of explanation and by hastening what is necessary.
The reason why a good manual surgeon is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen has related, until he knows the supports of the limbs and their shapes, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their courses, and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their exits.
And for that reason Hippocrates said that the name is much with the name, and little with the work, and especially in the art of the hand.
We indeed already said that in the introduction of this book.
Because he who is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy cannot avoid falling into error, by which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
That is, because I saw a foolish physician incise a scrofulous abscess in a woman's neck, and he cut some arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Therefore he reached it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with a strong binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he completed it according to his desires.
Afterwards he left him for several days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained so until his leg and foot became suppurated, and came to destruction.
Therefore I was called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and calmness followed, and he escaped from his pains.
Nevertheless, the corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who perforated a cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated afterwards, until its malignancy was magnified with its lord.
That is, because when a cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can tolerate having its whole substance cut away.
And for that reason, O my son, it is necessary for you to know that manual operation is divided into two divisions: namely, operation associated with safety: and operation with which there is danger in most instances. And I have already pointed out in every place in this book where an operation occurs which involves terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to avoid that, and to leave it alone, so that fools may not find a way to speak of it and bring dishonor.
Therefore take measure with care and caution, and treat your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to salvation and laudable success: and leave alone terrible ailments of difficult healing: and lift your spirits from that which makes you afraid, so that hesitation may not enter into your faith and your well-being. For it is more conducive to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your rewards.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness: lest you be called bad physicians.

Part I.
Concerning the benefit and harm of cautery: and to which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron or gold.
Chapter I.
But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms: and in what complexion it should be exhibited.
Therefore I say that the discussion of the quality of the benefit of cautery, and its harm, is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a science, and a hidden secret.
Many wise men have also spoken on it, and disagreed: and indeed a little from their discussions suffices me, fearing prolixity.
Therefore I say that cautery universally benefits every complexion which is with matter, and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
However, in the hot and dry complexion with matter they disagreed.
For some have said that cautery is beneficial in it.
And others said the opposite of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in the illness which is from heat and dryness: because the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness be treated with something hot and dry.
And he who says the contrary said: that benefit is achieved through cautery in every hot and dry illness which occurs in human bodies: because when you compare a human body and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I indeed say according to his statement: because experiment has already revealed that to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that one undertake this unless one is already proven and experienced in the final chapter of the practice of cautery, and has known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their duration.
From the other complexions, however, there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For indeed all physicians have agreed on them: and they did not disagree on the benefit with cautery in them.
And know, sons, that from the secret of treatment by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined with it, except with small harm.
The action of burning medicines, however, reaches that which is distant from the members: and perhaps it causes an illness difficult to heal in the member, and perhaps it kills.
Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Now indeed that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I excuse myself from lengthy speech.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is fitting to perform cauterization, and they put the better time in the spring.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at all times: because the harm happening because of time is submerged in the benefit which is drawn with cauterization.
And especially if cauterization is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness: because it is feared from them that a greater harm may happen than the small harm entering because of time.
And let not that fall into your minds, O sons, which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely that the illness which is healed by cauterization does not always return: and they posit that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cauterization is nothing but a medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the causes why pains happen.
Nevertheless cauterization surpasses medicine in the speed of its healthfulness and the strength of its operation and the vehemence of its mastery: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the complexion of the infirm, and the location of his illness, and its strength: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and what arrives at it in its acquisition from foods and similar causes, unless it is an illness in which cauterization is administered. An illness subtle in a limb with few superfluities and humors, such as cauterization of a tooth for pain, and things similar to it, it is possible that that pain may not return in it.
But that happens in few cases.
But truly the speech of the common people again, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is correct speech: not to that which they intend in it: since they believe that there is no cure which can be compared with medicine, nor with anything else after the application of cauterization.
But the matter is contrary to that, and the intention that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is not so, except that when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cauterization at the end of the matter, and it helps: then from that it falls out that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
The ancients, however, said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say that, except because of the evenness of gold and the excellence of its substance: and they said that the site of cauterization does not produce pus. That is not true absolutely: because I have now proved it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cauterization with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you cauterize with fire from gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the degree you wish, because of the redness of the gold: and when it is quickly cooled, and if you add more heating to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Therefore the craftsman falls into difficulty with it: and because of that, cauterization with iron is quicker and more convenient for us, because of its straightforwardness for the operation.
And I indeed have now arranged this Chapter on Cauterization according to chapters: and I have arranged them from head to foot: so that they may ease the one seeking what he wishes from it. Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization contributes to the control of moisture and coldness in the brain: which two are the causes of headache, and the abundance of the flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and of drowsiness, and toothache, and sore throat: and universally of every illness which arises from coldness, such as paralysis, headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the patient: that he be purged first with a cleansing purgative medicine for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the patient, and his age, and his custom require.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands squarely, so that he now places his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever therefore your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink. Then heat the olive-shaped cautery; its form is this. Then place it on the place marked with ink, descending, so that your hand is gradually tightened, and you will roll it.
Then quickly lift your hand, and look at the place.
If you see now revealed from the bone the quantity of the head of alkiel, or the quantity of zeuherbi, then lift your hand.
And if not, repeat with your hand the same iron, or with another if it cools, until you see the bones which I told you about.
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and soak the cautery in it, and place it on the place, and leave it for three days.
Then place on it the cautery soaked in butter, and leave it on the place until the burn mark is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it is healed.
Now they have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits; wherefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of the bone is burned.
Then scrape away what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the utmost with the cautery, until it makes a strong impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which is made like the shape of a kirate: or the instrument which women place in the infusion of a small alphabet: and they think that the vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it is consolidated.
But to me these two types of cautery do not seem at all suitable except in certain men according to the way of fear.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with its safety.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other members: and especially when the head of the sick person is naturally weak: and indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore operate with it safely.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head: and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cuppings, and head purges, and oils, and cataplasms.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things benefits him: then consider.
For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery a little below that one.
Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, until the skin is pierced, and a quantity of bone, which we have described, is uncovered.
And cauterize him with one cautery in the occiput of his head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed: and raise your cautery in this, and do not uncover the bone.
For the sick person finds because of that a very intense pain, and different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
And I shall call this cauterization in its place: and it is necessary that it be a cauterization, by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its occiput with a finer cautery, than that by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with a burning medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment which I described in the divisions of illnesses is administered, and it does not completely help: then cauterization is used in it according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine: or with iron. Cauterization with a sharp burning medicine, however, is that you take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Then incise the place of pain at the time with a wide phlebotom, until a space is made under the skin in which the clove is held.
Then insert it under the skin until it is hidden: then bind over it with a suitable constricting pad, and leave it for fifteen hours, then unbind it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterwards put over it lint soaked in butter, until the place forms pus: then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterization with iron, however, is in this manner.
A fire cautery, whose form is this.
And it is called a nail, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small projection.
Then place it on the spot and hold your hand; and you slowly revolve the iron with speed; and let the amount that is burned be of the thickness of the skin, about half of it.
And lift your hand, so that the artery below is not burned and a flow of blood does not occur.
Then soak a piece of cloth in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then apply a piece of cloth with butter; afterwards treat with ointment until it heals. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second knife-like end of the cautery.
And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an old one.
Concerning the method of cauterizing an old hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When you treat a hemicrania with what we have said from the preceding treatment, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we said from the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the knife-like cautery until it becomes white after you mark on the place of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or about that: and place your hand at once, and press it until you cut the artery, and reach to the bone. However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves in mastication, lest the side be burned, or the nerve which moves it, from which a spasm may result.
And be watchful and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut.
For in its cutting there is danger, and especially to him who is ignorant of what he does, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he leaves the operation with it at first.
And I will come with a recollection of the treatment of the flow of blood happening from an artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we have related, treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two knives.
For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial. Concerning the method of cauterizing in earache.
Chapter VI. When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with resolvents and the other treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and it is that which is called a point, whose form is this.
Then prick with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it is rolled; or around both, if pain is in both at the same time.
And move the cautery away from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with a hot iron: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points in each ear, about like that.
Then treat the places until they heal.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in torticollis.
Chapter VII.
Torticollis which is treated with cauterization is only from the types which arise from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of illnesses. And avoid cauterization of the type which arises from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this type of torticollis with bleedings, and purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little lower than its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
Because softening does not occur except in the part which appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the end of the upper ear, a little below the horn of the head: and another in the temple; the length of which should be according to the length of the thumb.
And place your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, the form of which has been mentioned previously; however, it is not a little thinner than that, as you see: and it is necessary that there be a knife of a little superfluous thickness in it. Then treat the place with what has preceded until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cautery in the occiput of the head, according to what has preceded: and let the method of cauterization be according to what has preceded.
Also, cauterization is done with a cautery over the stomach; and this is the most extreme measure.
Then let him be treated with what has preceded.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Oblivio.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that in the first instance, great quantities of hyssop and pills purifying the brain be given to the patient to drink.
Then shave the patient's entire head, and apply to the back of his head the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times. For this is the method of cauterization: and do it according to the same order which I described there. If therefore he is healed by it, it is good.
If not, then make for him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization the breadth of a finger.
Then treat the cauterization, with what preceded.
But if you wish an addition, and the patient is able to tolerate it: then make for him a cauterization in the middle.
But if you wish an addition: then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed: and let the cauterization be oiled according to the form which was set forth.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hyssop, and with that which we have said.
Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery above each horn of the head, and with a cautery behind it, and with three above the vertebrae of the neck.
But if in the illness you need the softening of the body with more of those things, and the infirm person is enduring, and the illness is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery, until a great deal of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Then care for him until he is healed: and thus the cautery of Oliuare.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless his epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with purgatives, and with the other treatment which we described in the division: when the patient is strong, or is tolerant in receiving medicines.
But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and mouthwashes cleansing the brain are administered, before that for many days, with improvement of diet.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the method: and with another cautery in his occiput, and over every horn of his head with a cautery.
But if the patient is strong and is tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned in the case of paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded. But if the patient is a child, then apply a small cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterization in melancholia.
Chapter XII.
When the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we mentioned in the case of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined towards melancholia, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him something to drink which will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a properly made bandage of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting squarely should be held on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is better from old sheep butter.
And heat it over a fire with a moderate measured heat, which the finger can tolerate when put into it.
Then empty it onto the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this for the patient once every week, along with his other good regime, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it making very small points of it, except that you hold your hand with the cautery: indeed, let it be by smelling.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with a quality.
Then place on it a pledget soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and purge the patient with that which cleanses his head.
And guard him from all dampness, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him on the two temples with two cauteries, if the beginning of the descent of water is in both eyes at once; or on one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the breadth of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
But if you see something of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and caution from the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries ultimately produced.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old tears.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are old, constant, and are over the veins and arteries which are in the exterior of the head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I have narrated in the beginning of the descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
And if you need an addition, then cauterize it on every side cautiously of the eye, over the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the stench of the nose.
Chapter XV.
When you treat it with what we said in the division, and the medication does not help: then hurry, and give the patient  infirmocochia for three nights; then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery.
Then cauterize it with a nail-shaped cautery, with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And beware of the artery, lest you wound it.
And this is the form of the nail-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not move your hand with the cautery, but according to the quantity that burns a third of the eyelid.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted, pricking the eye. Chapter XVII.
Cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.
In cauterization with fire, however, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who cleanse them, until they are lengthened and made even. But if they prick him at their root, then bind his eyes with a headband so that they do not move until they grow.
When therefore they have grown and are even, then place the patient's head in your bosom; then mark upon the eyelid of his eyes with a cautery iron, a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a pledget soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage upon the eye.
Then heat the cautery iron, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the shape which you marked little by little in many times, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is wholly burnt properly.
And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contract, and the hairs rise up at the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days.
Then place a pledget with butter on it, until the eschar is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some of the hairs return after a while, and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cauterization on that place, as you did at first.
But if the hairs are below, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is level so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
It is to instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even.
Make from paper or cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, one ounce of each or thereabouts; then grind them together well and quickly, so that it does not grow cold.
Then spread some of it on the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids.
And place under the eye a pledget soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently.
And you should move it whenever the patient feels the medicine biting; for its bite is like fire.
While therefore he feels this biting, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid rise, as it rises with burning, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then apply more of the medicine to the place where the medicine does not press down and does not darken, until your operation is even, and the eye is contracted.
Then place a pledget with butter on it, until the burnt skin is removed.
Then treat it with diaphnicum ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you in the operation that you observe the utmost care, lest anything of the medicine fall into the eye.
But if the eyelid softens afterwards, and something fights from the hairs in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it heals.
And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and smallness.
Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who studies this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a lachrymal fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom, and let a servant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it does not move or be shaken.
Then place a pledget soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage over his eye; then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish it to be upward, try thus.
However, this concave is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand with it a little near the cautery from the eye, to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not err, or the sick man is disturbed: and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If therefore you arrive at the bone with the beginning of your cautery, it will be well.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if you need it: and leave it for three days.
Then apply a pledget with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed. But if forty days have passed, and it is not healed: then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to it, until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to what has come in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the ancients mentioned.
Apply to the place of the fistula, and incise it: then place in the incision a thin tube, that is, a thin cannula, whose shape is this.
And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of molten lead, and hold your hand with good retention of the cannula, and let the patient not move at all, lest the molten lead run, or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the eye of the patient a compress soaked in egg white, or in water.
For the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
If the fistula is healed with what we have said, by cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to treat the opening of the nose, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come to its own proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing fissures of the lips.
Chapter 20.
Fissures, which are called chaps, often occur on the lip, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures with what we have said in the division of illnesses, and the treatment does not help, then prepare a small, knife-shaped cautery iron, according to this form.
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then treat it with cerate until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterizing an oral fistula.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, then it forms pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize with fire according to the amount it occupies in the fistula.
Then insert the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end; do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards with what we have said concerning treatment until it is cured.
If therefore the pus is cut away and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come into its head.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the gums and softened teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum is softened because of humors, and the teeth are loosened, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then a fire cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place a cannula upon the tooth: and quickly insert the ignited cautery into it: and hold your hand a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
For the loosened tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt humor is dried.
Chapter XXIII.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in the tooth, and treatment with medicines is of no help: then cautery is used in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
Now cautery with butter is as follows: take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a pan.
Then take a tent and wrap it around the end of a probe.
Then dip it in the boiling butter: and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times, until the power of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or a tent in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; and place a red-hot iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Now cauterization with fire is as follows: take a bronze tube or an iron tube. And let there be something in its body of some thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, whatever shape it may be: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or on another day.
And it is necessary in the impression of that cautery, that the patient fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for one hour: then spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, as far as possible: and this is the shape of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in strumae.
Chapter XXIV.
When strumae are from phlegm and from cold humors, and they are not obedient to digestion through medicines, and you wish to digest them quickly: then a concave cautery of fire, whose shape is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may exit from the cautery at the other end: and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time if it needs it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
But if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it lint infused in butter, until what the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth unguent, until it heals in the form of a small tube.
Concerning the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
Chapter 25.
When humors overcome the lung passage, and especially when it is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated first with solutive medicines.
Then cauterize it in the uvula at the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware lest you reach with the cautery to the throat, nor into the skin, except a little of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the juncture of the neck in the last vertebra of it, finally: and let the cautery be nail-shaped according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with that which preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in diseases of the lung and cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the infirm person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the disease is of long standing: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the clavicle in depressed, soft, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be a cannula according to the form which preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, which is called Punctum, whose form preceded in the puncturing of earache: and let the points be from thirty points up to about others.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore the cauterization is alleviated with it, when you do with it at once three cauterizations.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the armpit, in dislocation of the humerus.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated because of humors, and it is not fixed in the hour of its return from its dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation first.
Then the patient is laid supine on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then lift the skin which is in the inner armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then have a cautery with two points. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three points, wherefore the figure of the cauterization then becomes six cauteries: and the points are according to the thinness of the probe.
And this is the form of a cautery having three points.
And sometimes one is added in this way, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cautery.
Then make the patient adhere to stillness, so that the limb is not moved for some time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it from its complexion, and catarrhs multiply in it, and continuous methods of treatment do not help: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the breastbone the size of one finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on the two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And space them so that they do not join, when they produce pus. And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this cauterization is done be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for him who is frightened by this cautery: and it is so that you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity which you wish with a branding iron: then cauterize it with a pointed cautery: then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and dampness, or from gross flatulence, until it departs from its natural complexion by superfluous departure, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the patient be laid supine upon his neck, and you mark with a branding iron three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity upon the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the man's elbow arrives: and let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight body: and do not press your hand with the cautery very much.
And let the quantity of what is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, a quantity of half of it not added: and let the patient be standing on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then let him be lying, who now extends his legs, and raises his arms. This is the form of the cautery.
And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-cautery, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed excessively in cauterization, and burn the whole thickness of the skin, wherefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
Chapter 30.
When an exit wound occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient suffers pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, the pain is accompanied by intense sharpness: and you see now, that its treatment has fatigued the physicians.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back.
Then mark the location of the abscess with a cautery; then heat a cautery iron which resembles a ray.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it a single cautery, until the whole skin is burned, and it reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out: then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery, except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands these illnesses occur with some experience: then indeed let him dare this operation.
But indeed, to leave it alone is better in my opinion.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said, cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy in this manner.
And it is that you should take of the dried roots of birthwort, one longer root which is found among them, and let it be like the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and ignite it in the fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the clavicle with the neck, and with two small cauteries somewhat obliquely downwards towards the part which is under the chin.
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib, somewhat obliquely towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be apparent on the skin by smelling. And now some ancients have said that there are some men who use a cautery of iron similar to a ray: and they ignite it, and internally insert it into that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess with it, and pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no healing.
Chapter XXXII. On the method of cauterizing the spleen.
When you treat a disease of the spleen, with that which we have said of treatment in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then cautery in it is according to three methods, all of which are correct.
One of which is, that you make three cauteries, or four, lining up along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver cauteries, the figure of which preceded.
And let there be between each cautery the quantity of the thickness of a finger, or a little more.
And let the method of cautery be, as we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie supine on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you ignite a cautery having two prongs, which we spoke of in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and lift the skin which is in the direction of the spleen, where the left elbow of the patient arrives: and let your lifting of the skin be according to the breadth of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them: then withdraw the cautery: therefore four cauteries are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then take care of the cautery after you dismiss it, that it discharges pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than the other things which preceded from the treatment.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
Cautery does not fall in dropsy, except for ascites properly so-called.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery over the stomach, and another cautery over the liver, and a cautery over the spleen, and two cauteries on the back between the vertebrae, and one in the region of the chest, and another in the region of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be approximately the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment after cauterization: for it is necessary that two intentions be combined in him; and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, according to what preceded concerning its shape; and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-shaped, according to what preceded concerning its shape.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs. Chapter 34.
When abscesses form in a dropsical patient and are filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize above the dorsum of the foot in the hollow which is between the little and ring fingers; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
Then the yellowish water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Then make two cauteries on each of the two legs, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another below that, about the middle of the leg: and on each hip two cauteries: and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may sweat out from it; then treat it with the other things which we have mentioned.
Concerning the method of cauterization in looseness of the bowels. Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and humors, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with methods of treatment, and it is not healed, and you see the patient tolerating cauterization of exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, as preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a thin nail-like cautery: and a large cautery, or two cauteries, over the alcatin above the alhosos.
And if you see exuberant humors, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery over the pubis, and a cautery over each ilium: and perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupt humors, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower vertebra of the back under the almeidati somewhat triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel as if with two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming inflamed, then cauterize him above the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize above his liver, and another above his spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you cut away althelul, then heat a cautery that resembles a ray.
Then insert it, burning, into the excised althelul: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice. If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have related.
Then treat them with that which benefits them of ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more effective in helping.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38.
When the patient does not obey the incision and the operation which we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he may be healed with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and it becomes old, pus and corrupt humors flow from it.
Therefore, it is more fitting that you should probe it with a slender probe.
Then learn the amount of its depth with a probe.
Then heat a cautery which is similar to a ray.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula and the amount in which the nail entered. And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount of your necessity.
And guard yourself from burning a nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all those places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it is healed.
But if the place is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time: then know that it is now completely healed.
And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is a corrupt bone, or something like that from those: the mention of which will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Chapter 39.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from thick wind, and the strength of the sick person is diminished because of it, then it is necessary that you cauterize it above the almethen above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over each kidney with a nail-shaped cautery, the mention of which has preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almeidatu itself.
Therefore three lines will result.
Therefore the last ones will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter 40. When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and dampness, until the patient no longer retains urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the pubis above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and with a cautery on the right side of the pubis, and another on the left: and let the length of that lateral cauterization be according to the size of the finger joint: and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or two cauteries, if you need it: and let it be according to the preceding cautery with a nail.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb. Chapter 41.
When cold and dampness occur in the womb, and it is prevented by that from impregnation, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the pubis in the lower back, or two cauteries: and let the cautery be with a nail.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Chapter 42.
When mucous humors are poured out to the socket of the hip, and they become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg is lengthened over the other, when they are compared together: and the place of dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the socket of his hip with a cautery similar to a circle: after you mark with a hot iron around the socket, as it is revolved: and that the socket itself falls in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
But if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of all the skin.
Then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in sciatica. Chapter 43.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and the cause of this is cold and dampness: and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary to purge the patient of gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is to cauterize above the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them a good, or bad depth.
And let the space which is between each cautery be the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes however the cautery is made in the middle above the head of the hip joint itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, the form of which preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, with one: so that it may be a circle containing the whole hip.
And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place to which the sick person points there, in which there is pain, and with your cautery on the calf four fingers towards the outside a little: and let the cautery be knife-shaped. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a pointed cautery, with three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-shaped cautery.
And beware in all your cauterization, that you do not go so far with the cautery as to burn a nerve, or a large artery, and thereby draw upon the sick person great harm, or contraction.
And I indeed have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in cauterization, and the leg swelled, until the swelling reached the foot, and it was entirely perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there followed a discharge of the bowels, and death after that.
But if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men have said, in the cauterization of the hip, of which this is the method.
Make a similar iron cautery, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its orifice according to the thickness of a date-stone, or somewhat less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of a thumb-joint: and let the cauteries be open on two sides: and let their height be about a joint, or two joints: and make for them a handle of iron decently fitted to the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the hip-socket, the patient lying on his healthy side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave him for three days.
Afterwards, apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, "My son, we have used this type of cautery little, because of the terror of its appearance: and because we have found few who would endure it.
However, it is among the good cauteries for him who endures it, and finds with it its place.
Now the cautery with burning medicines is such that you make two samia having a perforated ring, into which descends a hinge of its door of bronze or iron, the length of the wall; in the height of which are two nodes, or something like them.
And let the space which is between both be the amount of the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above; and let that which contains itself towards each other be according to this form.
Then place it over the hip joint, the patient lying on the healthy side.
And press your hand very much upon the hip joint.
Then pour between the two circles warm water which has been heated a little with fire, and hold it for the amount of an hour; and let the patient endure its biting and burning, for he will find the biting like fire, until the biting rests.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the whole hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for a few days, and pus will flow from it.
For it is the ultimate aid.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the pain extends to the hip or leg: make him sit in what contains water, as you did with the hip equally.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and unslaked lime, one part of each; grind both, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that the ray enters; and place under the bottom of the pot another glass pot; and pour over the alkali and lime fresh water, which submerges both by a finger’s breadth: after which you compress them with your hand with good pressure; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over more lime; and filter until it is renewed.
For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other members.
Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And among medicines are those with which ankles are cauterized, also such as tesisie, and cashew nut honey, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
And Galen indeed, in narrating, recounted the treatment of a certain man from antiquity, by which he was cured of hip pain and sciatica; and he magnified it to be very good.
And he said that he did not need another treatment, and that he was healed in one turn, until he recounted that he perhaps entered a bath carried, and came out of it already healed. And it is so that it is taken from green setaragi; and if green is not found, let dry, fresh be taken; and let it be rubbed much with some fat, and let it be placed on the hip where there is pain, or leg, or in the hip joint; and let it be bound, and let it be left for the amount of three hours, or for the amount that the infirm person feels a lessening of the burning.
Then introduce him into the bath.
When therefore his body becomes dewy, introduce him into the bath-chair.
For the pain recedes, and it is healed.
And know that it is not fitting that anyone use a cautery with these medicines, except after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides also said that goat dung, when the sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and the cautery is done in this way.
Let wool be taken, and let it be soaked in old oil, and let it be placed upon the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle bone, and is closer to the ankle bone.
Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Then repeat it.
Therefore do not cease doing this until sensation reaches the middle as far as the ankle, and the pain ceases.
And this method of cauterization is called the Vaccine cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Chapter 44.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter; and cauterization is not suitable except in this type alone, which occurs from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with foul-smelling pills and the like, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the almond, after marking with ink five cauteries or more in each line, according to the amount that comes from the patient's tolerance and strength: and the cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a nail-shaped cautery, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in incipient gibbosity.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often happens to small infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you will find in the last vertebra of the back and its nodes that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in this form.
And let the cautery take hold of every part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, [make] two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place until it heals with what we have said.
And beware lest you apply the cautery to a hump which is formed in a spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in gout and the pains of the joints. Chapter 46.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which are poured out into any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name it gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of healing, and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is so that one cauterizes him after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Whose form is this.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
But if the pains ascend to the knees, or the other joints, and this happens many times, then cauterize it above each knee with three cauteries, or four on every side, with this same clavus-shaped cautery. If, however, more are necessary with this cautery, then cauterize him. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
But if the pains ascend to the knees and the back, then administer what we said of cautery in its chapter.
But if the pains are only in the hands, then puncture around the wrists, as if two lines are rolled around.
But if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, a point above every node, and above the ridge of the hand.
But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not deprive the patient of good regimen, of the reception of medicines.
For if good regimen is done, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with God's help with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Chapter XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is beginning to be near: then it is necessary that you order the patient to omit eating on his day.
And that he use lenitives, so that stool descends from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath, until the bladder or intestine emerges or appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cautery under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which is of this form, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Then return the intestine or bladder to its cavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand on the place, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the legs of the patient, and placed a cushion under him, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery on the mark, your hand with the cautery standing straight.
And hold it until you reach the bone with it; or repeat with it another time if you have not reached the bone with it on the first attempt.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and there results from it for the patient either death or great harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be thin, according to their size.
Then treat with other ointments until it is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you provide his nourishment for the length of time of his treatment, which softens his bowels: so that the intestine does not come out during straining and evacuation.
Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another forty days.
For when he uses this regime, thus he is healed with a complete healing.
But when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be as one-third of it.
Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not increase.
And now some earlier ones have said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with a hot iron, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help it: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of every limb be according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it heals from the first cauterization, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cauterization on it.
Because it is customary for these pains to move from one limb to that which is near it.
Therefore it is necessary that you pursue them with cautery, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Chapter 49.
Lepers, moreover, are sometimes aided by cautery with the greatest benefit.
And especially the type of leprosy which arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you wish to cauterize it, consider.
If therefore the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it does not descend, nor stand still: and you fear for the patient, that corruption will seize upon his whole constitution: then cauterize him upon the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, noticeably, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two upon the two temples, and one behind upon the nape of the neck.
And lastly apply your hand with the cautery lightly, until it imprints a small mark upon it, and the scabs are loosened from it: so that the exhalation of gross vapors from it may be relieved, and cauterize also with a cautery upon the spleen itself, as has preceded.
But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head, and with a cautery upon the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries upon the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries upon the vertebrae of the neck, and six upon the vertebrae of the back, and one large one upon the haunch near the coccyx and one above it, in the almeidati: and two upon the hips: namely upon each hip one, and two upon the knees: one upon each knee, and two upon the shoulders, and two upon the elbows, and two upon the tenderness of his chest: and cauterize him upon every joint, of the joints of his fingers and toes: and cauterize upon every heel of his feet, and the wrists of his hands.
And beware of the nerves which are upon the back of the heel, lest you burn them. And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery upon the pubic bone, and another upon the stomach, and another upon the liver.
And know that the more you add cautery, the more is the help, and the more beneficial.
And know that the patient does not find pain in cautery, as healthy people find it: because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to what preceded in the kinds of instruments.
Chapter L.
When a limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to what the size or smallness of the limb deserves.
And let your cautery penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes cauterization is done for some numbness which happens in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Truly, let no one presume upon this except he who is wise in the anatomy of the limbs, and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Albaras.
Chapter 51.
When the albaras becomes chronic, and nothing from the arts of medicine benefits it: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery a little, according to the amount of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with the flour of the herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: of each let there be one part; let all these be mixed, and spread upon a cloth, and applied to the place, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in cancer.
Chapter 52.
When the cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it is rolled up.
The wise, however, have said that it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery in the middle.
But it does not seem so to me; because I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen that happen several times. And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said; or with many cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Chapter 53.
When someone has an adubelati, and it is slow in maturing, either because of the superfluity causing it, or because of the age of the patient, when he is decrepit and has little blood, or because of the time, and one wishes to hasten the maturation of the adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it itself will hasten with maturation.
But if you wish its perforation with a cautery, then a fire cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the diseased, so that the flow of pus may be alleviated.
Then care for it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corroding ulcer. Chapter 54.
A corroding ulcer is nothing but a corruption in a limb that moves, and corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore if you see a corroding ulcer in a place that will tolerate cauterization with fire, then have many fire cauteries, small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place where the corroding ulcer is.
Then cauterize it from every part until you eradicate the whole corruption, and nothing at all of it remains. Then leave it for three days, and apply crushed sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas, until all the eschars and all the corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Therefore if you see that after three days flesh grows in a healthy growth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And a corrosive is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine.
For it arises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker help: and indeed I have already spoken of its cauterization with a sharp medicine in the division: therefore take it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in nails and warts. Chapter 55.
Often this sickness happens in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing which harms the foot. And indeed cautery in them is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for that with fire, make a concave fire cautery similar to a vulture's feather: which is made from iron, according to the quantity which contains the nail on every side: and let it be of thin edges.
Then place it, ignited, upon the nail. Then roll the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus. Then plaster it with wild mallows, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster upon it at night. For it itself will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the place with a flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
But if they are not inverted, and happen many times on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply a cautery to them with warm water: and it is so that you take a small tube of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather: and place it over the nail, or wart.
Then throw into the tube a small quantity of warm water: hold your hand, and you revolve it with a slight compression of your hand, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the nail, and the warm water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait a little for the biting of the warm water for one hour.
Then leave it, for the nail is eradicated with its roots.
Do this with them one after another, until you come to all of them that are in the body.
Then care for them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
Chapter 56.
When tremor happens to someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, upon the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and upon his stomach a cautery.
For tremor rests with olive cautery, and the health of a cold illness hastens. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes foul things are expelled in the body, that is, pustules, which are made from gross corrupt matters.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary that they be cauterized on every head of the pustule with a fine cautery with myrtle wood, whose end is lit with fire.
Or with the root of long birthwort.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized immediately, at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and they do not increase; and the superfluity making them is broken, and is healed from them.
However, it is necessary that it be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Very often there occurs a flow of blood from an artery which is cut in a wound, which happens externally, or in the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to cut it off.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and press it firmly until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing comes out from it. Then put in the fire small olive-oil cauteries, and many large ones; and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place in which the artery is broken, and place the cautery upon the vein, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
But if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries which are prepared in the fire. Therefore do not cease doing this with one after another until the bleeding stops.
And beware lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another harm befall the patient. And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the bleeding is stopped.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the bleeding is stopped. Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Or medicines with the property of staunching blood are placed upon it, and it is bound with a suitable compress.
But he who manages its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the application of cauterizing agents, and the like, does not completely benefit him, except rarely.
But if this should happen to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present, then he should begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have described, and constricting it strongly, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
And the finger is not removed, pouring cold water of intense coldness constantly over it, until the blood clots and thickens, and is excised. And meanwhile he should consider what he needs from a cautery or from medicine.
The End of the First Part.
Book of Surgery of Albucasis Part II. Concerning Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds and similar things.
We have already said in the first chapter, every illness in which a cautery with fire and burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I placed chapters there from the head to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that what is sought may be lightened for the seeker. And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter is, from the terror, that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that it is necessary that caution be more vehement in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often falls, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit, or cure of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death falls upon many of them.
And I warn you, lest that fall upon you in which there is hesitation, for sometimes there fall to you in this art kinds of men with kinds of infirmities.
For among them is he who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him: because of the vehemence of what he finds from his illness and the length of its malice.
And with illness is from fear which signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his wealth, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious. Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be more vehement than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything of it, except after certain knowledge, which verifies with you that to which a laudable outcome arrives.
And use in the treatment of all your sick, prognosis and indication of that to which health is suitably directed.
For in that is for you help in the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you direction and inspiration: because that is in his hand.
And I indeed have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: that the thing which you wish from it, and of which you have need, may be lightened for you.
Concerning the treatment of water which gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this infirmity very often happens to children at birth; or when the midwife constricts the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this sickness in others than in children: and death has hastened to all whom I have seen of them; therefore it seemed to me to omit an operation in it.
And indeed I saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until it could not sit upright because of the size of its head: and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture indeed, either gathers between the skin and the bone; or gathers under the bone upon the dura mater.
And the operation in that, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with one cut in width: and let the length of the incision be about two fingerbreadths, until the moisture flows out.
And this is the shape of the spatula.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head opened on every side: and the water is depressed when you compress it with your hand inwards, and that is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this manner.
And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Then moisten it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the binding, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound equally.
And feed the patient all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes it is greater in the occiput, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear to you: and incise it as much as is possible for you.
And observe that you do not cut an artery, and that a flow of blood occurs, and that the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of the moisture.
Concerning the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When catarrhs happen to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and it becomes chronic, and the treatment of medicines does not help: then the final treatment in this is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the patient shave his head.
Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Then let the patient bind his neck with any cloth of his.
Then consider where the vein pulsates.
And the locations of both are the depressed places which are behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain men.
Then mark with a cautery on each side: and incise each with a sharp spatula on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and let this be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, introduce the spatula under the artery, and incise it upwards with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
For when a vein is incised, blood flows out with a pulsatile flow, which leaps inwards with a frequent leap.
But if the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers.
Then mark with cautery, and incise to the bone.
And that which it is necessary to let out of blood, is six ounces and perhaps you let out more, or less from it. All that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the infirm and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if something of the sifac remains at the bone, then incise it, lest a hot abscess occur: then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic headache, or acute catarrh due to acrid humors and heat in the temples, or chronic headache and similar conditions, and he is treated with medical remedies and they do not help, then we have found in these illnesses that extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have described, is effective.
And the method of operating in their extraction is that the patient should shave the hairs which are in the temples, and direct [the attention] to the artery appearing in the temple.
For it is shown to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by the intensity of cold.
But if it is hidden from you, then let the patient bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or steam the place with hot water, until it appears to you in manifest appearance. Then take a spatula, which I formed a little while ago. Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Then throw a hook into it, and draw it upwards, until you draw it out of the skin, and make it escape from the tunics which are beneath it on every side.
But if the artery is thin: then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Then cut from it a part according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and that no flow of blood occurs.
For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not rise completely. Then evacuate from the blood about six ounces, up to three.
But if the artery is large: then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with double thread, strong, of silk or of alhod cords, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the healing of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures.
Do this at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a knife-cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
And it is a better operation, unless the patient has a fever, or is of a heated complexion.
Because cautery is among those things which help to end humidities.
Therefore it is a better remedy.
And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries that the place be filled with old cotton; and that properly made pledgets be placed upon it.
And after dissolution it should be treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to grow, and with linen cloths, until it is healed.
But if meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi; and bind your hand until the blood is cut off.
But if none of these things is present to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood clots.
And bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness ceases, and bind it as is necessary.
And of what is lighter and easier to extract from an artery, it is that you cauterize a vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to an almond.
However, they are of much less sharpness than two knives.
Because if they are sharp, like two knives, cold hastens to both: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this therefore the work is better than all work, and lighter, and easier.
And let the space which is between the two knives be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with a branding iron: and place both very hot, until they arrive at the mouth, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities is lengthened.
For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Concerning the care of sharp, constant flow of tears from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When there are constant tears, and their flow is from the veins which are on the outside of the skull, and nothing of medicinal cures helps with them, and you see the face of the sick person already reddened, and he feels a crawling on his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are thinned, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with corrosion, and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears; then the ancients needed in their cure this operation, and they named it a cure with the Knife.
And it is so that you should instruct the sick person to shave the hairs which are on his forehead.
Then incise three equidistant fissures on the forehead according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of the fissure be about two fingers, and one fissure be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the muscles, and the third from the other side; and beware of cutting the arteries which are on the two sides; and lengthen your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of each incision be the amount of three joined fingers; and have a prepared piece of sponge, or much dried cloth, with which you will dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which the following is soon the form.
From the incision which is from the side of the temples, up to the second incision; and scrape with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, with the sifac which is above the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, press out the places with clots of congealed blood. Then put into each fissure a pledget of old linen, and place over them pledgets soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the ligature, and administer a plentiful infusion with warm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs in the eyes from the interior of the head.
Chapter V.
When sharp, acrid, persistent catarrhs affect someone, and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their sight already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is sharp, intense pain deep in the head, and sneezing follows: then understand from these occurrences that those materials and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
And the best treatment for them is this.
And it is that you order the patient to shave his forehead.
Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to one side, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision go to the bone: and keep your hand away from the temporal muscles which move during mastication: until the bone is uncovered: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old linen or linen strips.
Then bind it above with pledgets: and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you unbind it, and you see that the hot abscess is now diminishing: then you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of resin: and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear. Chapter VI. Whatever falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar, and things similar to them; or some animal.
When therefore a stone, or a kind of stone from those which are not added to, nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then instill into the ear something of perfumed oil, or sesame oil.
Then manage its extraction, and make him sneeze with sneezing powders, and close the nostrils at the coming of the sneezing, after you place around the ear pieces of cloth, or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
For very often it comes out with this treatment.
But if it does not come out, then manage its extraction with forceps, that is, with fine tweezers: whose form is this.
If therefore it comes out with forceps, it is good.
And if not, then manage its extraction with a small, thin, blunt hook. If therefore it does not come out by that, then make a cannula of bronze, and insert the end of the cannula into the hole of the ear deeply, and plug what is around the cannula with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for the wind except through the cannula: then extract it with your strong suction. For very often it comes out with what we have narrated.
But if it does not come out in this way: then take some helkalimbat, or some birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a moderate amount: and place it on the end of a rod after you have neatly wrapped cotton around it: then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incise, before a hot abscess or a spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is that the phlebotomist first bleeds the patient in the cephalic vein: and draw from him blood according to his strength.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fat in the depressed place: and let the incision be of a lunar shape, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever is possible for you from the instruments.
Then sew up the incision at your leisure with speed, and care for it until it heals.
But if the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell, then manage its extraction.
But if it does not obey you to exit, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this form.
And manage with it the excision of that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do that when you think that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with a subtle forceps, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is eased.
In the water however which enters the ear, it is necessary that the infirm person use sneezing with the head held back first: and he has already filled his ear with a little old cheese: and is lying on that ear in which is the water.
If therefore it exits through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire a little, and let the infirm person introduce one of them into the hole of his ear: and let him jump on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Therefore let him not cease doing that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
And now the water exits so, that you take from a pyre, or from a rush one, and introduce one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burnt.
Then repeat another rush, and do this many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a tube as was previously described for the stone.
In the extraction however of an animal entering into it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of a large body, which is apparent to the senses: then manage its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its matter is easier than all things which are held in the ear.
In the extraction however of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise of distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun.
If therefore something of worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the form, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate: then suck with it with strong suction.
Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
But if they do not obey you to come out, then seal around the edge of the cannula with wax, as I said in the case of a stone.
And if they do not come out with what we have said, then administer distillations which the ancients have already tested in the killing of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring out of oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As you see, make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, with a small hole, wide above.
Therefore let that which pushes what is in the concavity of the cannula be made neatly of bronze.
And if you wish, take a radius and wrap cotton around its end neatly; then pour oil or juice or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the radius with the cotton from above, and press it with your hand with moderate compression until the oil is impelled into the concavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear should already have been heated a little with fire; and beware that the thing which is distilled into it is not very cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.
Concerning the treatment of blockage happening in the ear.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes certain infants come forth from the wombs of their mothers imperforate.
And it also happens to some people that there is a blockage in the passage of the ear from a wound, or from flesh growing there.
And this blockage sometimes occurs in the depth of the opening of the ear, which sight does not reach; and sometimes it happens at the exterior of the opening a little, and sight reaches it.
Therefore that which happens in the depth of the ear, and which sight does not comprehend, is in most instances difficult of healing.
And in that which sight reaches, it is necessary that you place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look into it: then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a thin spatula, whose form is that which follows, let its extremity in which there is a certain small width, a certain part of which is sharp: and let the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides: so that it does not injure the ear.
If therefore the blockage is from flesh grown in the passage of the ear: then hold it with a thin hook, and cut it with strong ease, until all the flesh is removed.
But if the blockage is in the depth of the ear: then take a thin, smooth probe, and heat it slightly with fire: then insert it into the passage of the ear.
If therefore you feel the blockage with it, which the sick person finds with difficulty of hearing, attempt its opening with ease: and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a pledget according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Or take a pledget, and soak it in rose water, and powder over it crushed vitriol, and use it.
But if you see the ear already festering: then it is necessary that you remove the pledget, and leave it with another pledget, which you will wrap in cerate which is made with rose oil, until the warm abscess subsides: then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding should occur: then submerge a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the remaining treatment, which stops the flow of blood, described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of a stye on the eyelid.
Chapter VIII. Those styes which occur on the eyelids of the eye, are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary to grasp them with forceps: or with a hook, and to cut them out with a spatula from their roots.
Then place pounded vitriol on the area.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after incision.
For often they return when something remains of their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of the eyelids' hailstone.
Chapter IX.
Very often something happens in the eyelids which is similar to hail in its strength and hardness, and because of that it is called hailstone: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation in them is that you consider then, if it is a hailstone proceeding in that which appears of the eyelid, and they are moved to every part, and its matter is easy.
Therefore find a fissure upon it lengthwise.
Then flay it from every side easily until it comes out.
Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
But if its excision is not prepared for you except after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision a little, then that harms the patient in something.
But if the fissure is large, then unite it with a suture and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and fills it with flesh.
And if the hailstone slopes towards the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then invert the eyelid and suspend the hailstone with a hook, except that you need an incision, and press it on all sides.
If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, it will not harm in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water, and treat the place with that which produces flesh, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the axirnath of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is fat which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid; and it happens most to boys; and it weighs down their eyes, and catarrhs happen to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them; and therefore you see them lying down on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, which swelling has now covered; and the prominence of the axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person puts his head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare a pledget in it, and make from that pledget a circle according to the quantity that contains the axirnath on every side.
Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on every side, so that the axirnath may collect in the middle of the circle.
Then make a cut in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, making incisions across, and let not the incision be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you cut the whole skin until you arrive at the axirnath; for in many dispositions the axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore draw it out with the cloth which you have infiltrated between your fingers to the exterior: and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed: and beware lest you add to the incision, so that you do not arrive with the lancet to the eye, and injure it.
But if the axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, add a little to the incision easily, until the axirnath comes forth.
Then draw it out, as we have said.
Then submerge cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and bind it with powders.
And some men grind salt and put it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may be liquefied.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if it happens in a place of a hot abscess, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Concerning the ways of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whence it happens that it is wrinkled as it ought not to be.
Chapter XI.
When superfluous hairs are born in the eyelids besides the course of the natural hairs, and grow old: then they harm the eye, and cause various sicknesses, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and albugo, until it becomes a cause of destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was premised in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Or by tubes, according to what I shall say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle into it, in which is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with the thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a probe.
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid below the added hairs with a spatula, falling from the larger lachrymal [gland] to the smaller lachrymal [gland].
Then remove the thread, and place a small pledget of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: then mark above the eyelid with cautery, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape is made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because this varies in men.
For there is one who needs a large amount to be incised from the eyelid, according to the amount which is softened from the eyelid. Then with a spatula incise upon the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger lachrymal [gland] to the smaller lachrymal [gland], and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, such as is the thickness of a ray.
Then introduce a hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then flay it completely. Then join together the two lips with a suture, with a needle and fine woolen thread: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere that which superfluously protrudes from the threads over the two eyebrows, with certain sticking substances, if you wish to do it: and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days: afterwards treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts.
For the eyelid is raised at the closure of the wound and its joining: but it will be better in the future.
The ancients taught this method of treatment, Ataxmir.
Nevertheless, there is concern about the patient, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, separate or joined, according to this form which follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with evenness of incision.
But if it is not possible for you to hold a hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the greater lachrymal, and a second thread near the lesser lachrymal: and bring together between your fingers the threads with evenness.
Then raise your hand with an even elevation: and raise the skin on which the mark has been made, as we have narrated.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it, until it is healed.
But if an abscess should occur at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with cerate, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that their hairs are turned.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
And it is, that you turn back the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have related.
Then skillfully make two canes, or two slender pieces of wood: whose length shall be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width shall be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully apply each over that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the two canes from both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. For the constricted skin will die, and will blacken, and will putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then incise it with scissors.
Then treat it until it is healed.
When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two tubes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
Concerning the elevation of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The operation in this is, that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread. Then you bring together its ends, and tie each with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place in Alinxotati another fine thread under it shortly, and knot its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient place his head in your bosom, and be near the sun so that the operation may be clear: because it is a subtle, or minute, operation.
Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the Alinxotati: and insert into the Alinxotati that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the Alinxotati is pulled, and the hair does not come out with it: you will pull the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have placed in it, until the Alinxotati comes out from the upper hole, and you see it with the sight of the eye: then indeed you will pull the Alinxotati and the thread: and pull out both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and it will be lifted with it; or leave it, until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
Concerning the care of the Alxatrati which happens in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental therefore happens from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is that you split that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and you place between them a pledget of linen, and you bind it, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things which dry and constrict; for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocate with water in which althea, linseed, and diachylon ointment has been boiled, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap with it a pledget, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all your ingenuity that it not consolidate, according to the form which it was at first.
And this indeed operation which we have spoken of, is nothing but a certain rectification of Alxatrati, that the form of the place not return completely to what it was. Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which occurs below, is that which is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental one arises from a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you insert it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread arrives at the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and incise it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it ought, it is good.
And if not, take a radius, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is made from them: until when they are joined their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with a wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have said, of softening medicines and linen cloths, until they are healed.
And if an abscess occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a linen cloth, according to what we have said.
And the sum of the discussion about the treatment of an abscess, when it is above or below, is that the operation proceeds in it according to how the abscess is prepared.
For it is of many diversities in form: and the skillful surgeon prepares the method with whatever way is possible for him, until he restores the form to its natural form, or near it, and the patient himself, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and instruments in many situations.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid and lift it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not have the sharpness of cutting spatulas, but rather be somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed and injures the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you are scraping away that adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the whole adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with water: or instill into it from a sieve made from ziniar dissolved with water.
Then separate the eyelid and eye with a linen cloth: and place on the eye wool infused with egg white: and after the third day use a sieve, and with solidifying agents, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of flesh of the tear ducts.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the nail is according to two methods. Or it is sinewy: and is similar to hard, thin parchment.
Or it is not sinewy, similar to congealed white moisture: which when iron touches it, or you try to seize it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not fix itself in it.
And both types do not begin except from the greater lachrymal [duct], until it gradually goes, until it covers the vision, and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operating in its incision is: that the sick person puts his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Then collect the growth with a hook of little doubling, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, or an ox, or a cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the growth: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the growth with thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the growth which follows the pupil, as if you were scraping it with the hair to its end.
Then incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that a constant flow of tears may not result from its incision.
And sometimes the growth is extended with a hook alone: or with thread, as we have said.
Then scrape it with a smooth spatula, whose form is this.
And beware lest the spatula touch the corneal tunic, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Then after the incision, throw into the eye something of crushed salt, or of a powder made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Then treat it with what is appropriate, until it is healed. But if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is treated many times with medicines, and is healed as I have narrated in the division.
But if you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a thin, smooth spatula, of weak sharpness, according to this form.
And shave the nail from above with reason and subtlety.
But if you see that it is rarefied and broken, and the shaving impresses upon it, then distil from your hour into the eye some eye-salve made from zinc, or from red eye-salve, or crushed salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation on it, until the whole of it is removed.
Unless there is a warm abscess in the eye contrary to this: for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it is healed. Then repeat the operation on it with reason, until it is healed.
But the eminence of the lachrymal flesh, if it harms the eye with great harm, should be suspended with a hook, and a part of it incised: and do not extend the incision, lest the flow of tears be impeded.
Then drop into the lachrymal duct red  eye salve, or that made from  verdigris, until it is healed. Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and the flesh born in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes a red, fleshy growth is born in the eyes of men, either superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a wild rose.
And the operation in it is also, that the infirm one puts his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with hooks suitable for it: and hold it with one forceps, or a pair.
Then incise the flesh first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel.
And beware of the eye, lest you injure it during the operation: and let your incision be that with which you incise it, either with a spatula, which we have described in the incision of the nail: or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, according to what its form will become after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed, and all the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or instill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye externally cotton with egg white: so that it may be protected from hot inflammation.
But if some of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear hot inflammation: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which soothes inflammation.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh which occurs in the eye from this type.
However, it is necessary that you avoid treating any weak eye, from a natural or accidental cause, by operating with iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations, until you see that the member is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the removal of a cataract from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Cataracts are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent the sight from performing its function: and they weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which is the cataract is strong, and there is no illness in it other than the cataract: then remove its cataract.
And it is so that you instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks joined in one body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors skillfully, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are resolved: and beware lest you injure the eye with the ends of the spatula.
And let your operation be at midday in front of the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red vitriol: so that by its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the sebum.
But if it is not possible for you to collect all of it at that time, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until its pain is settled: and it is secured from a hot abscess: then repeat on it in the same way, until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of the Arissati to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians name Arissati a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what its description preceded.
And if it is not healed, then there is no skill in it: except that you should incise above the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is uncovered.
When therefore the bone is uncovered, and you see in it corruption, or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is named the rough head.
Let it be made of untempered iron, and let its head be round like an awl, which should be pointed with the point of a file, or the point of an aliskilfer with a fine point: and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone. Then roll it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that that corruption is now scraped: and do that several times.
Then roll it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that that corruption is now scraped: and do that several times. Then restore the place with drying styptic medicines.
If therefore the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not fester, and no accident happens in it: then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is nothing in it but to reduce the fistula to the hole of the nose, according to this form.
And it is, that you uncover from the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone is uncovered, then take a trepan according to this form, let its iron extremity be triangular: and let its wood be a pyramid narrowed to the extremity, as you see.
Then place it upon the bone itself: and let it be near the lachrymal duct: and lengthen your hand from the eye a little.
Then revolve your hand with the trepan, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: through this that he finds wind coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with drying styptic medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens: then the matter which was poured out to the exterior, returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter on the patient.
Concerning the reduction of a protrusion of the eye. Chapter 20.
When the eye protrudes with its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision: then it is necessary that you loosen the patient; then you should bleed him; afterwards you should apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Then bind the eye from above with a plaster with many small pads.
And the method of the small pads is: that you take many soft cloths, and each cloth of them is doubled four times: make many of them: then place them one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth with a strong binding.
And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if the binding again softens, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly: then remove the binding after a day and a night, as we said.
Therefore if you see the eye has returned to the coat of the grape, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the small pads, and the binding, and the cupping glasses, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the grape coat.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the grape coat, then it protrudes and comes forth outside the eyelids like a grape seed, and the appearance of the man is disfigured because of it, and it is necessary to incise it: then the operation in it is, according to what I relate: and it is, that you insert a needle into the root of the grape from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle in which is a double thread from the lachrymal part, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the grape around the needle; and tighten it much.
Then remove the needle, and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and leave it until the thread falls with the grape.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the grape is constricted from every part with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds a large prominence.
Then it is perforated with a fine spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and the white moisture flows, and the eye descends, and enters immediately: then tighten it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of alcomnati.
Chapter XXII.
This illness which is called alcomnati is nothing but pus which gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not itself.
And the method of operating on it is to make the sick person sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Then take his head with your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Then let it be fixed, and not descend, and the light be resolved: and let the sick person see things as he saw: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and incise with it above the corneal layer a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the cornea, until the pus comes out.
When therefore it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then let it be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already spoken of the species of water in the division, and what is suitable for perforation by a statement declaring and explaining, then take that same thing according to health.
Then therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands squarely, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his sound eye, and bind it tightly: then the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which is the water, is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take in your right hand an almond, if the eye is the left: or in your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the end of the almond near the cornea by the thickness of a ray in the very apparent whiteness of the smaller lachrymal eye: then push the almond with force: and you revolve with it your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye: and you feel that the almond has now arrived at the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almond to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and that is the cornea of the eye.
For you will see them in the pupil itself, by the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Then put the almond up to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almond comes out.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almond with ease: and you roll your hand gradually. Then dissolve something of clear gem salt in water: and wash the eye inside with it.
Then place outside the eye a whole pledget, or wool infused with rose oil and egg white: and bind with it the healthy eye.
But we, and those who are of our time, place on it crushed cumin with egg white.
But if the almond does not obey you at entry into the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose form is this.
Therefore pierce with it only the conjunctiva, and do not put your whole hand in the hole: and it is only to make a subtle way to the place of the almond.
Then introduce the almond, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, let a properly made bed be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and let him be forbidden all movements, and coughing: and place his food, that which soothes his nature: and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage remain in its position until the third day. Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his sight: and make him see things.
Then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that he do this at the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather it is fitting that he avoid it: because water quickly ascends through vehement gazing.
But if a warm abscess occurs, then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day: and rectify it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed: then bind up his sight, and place on his face an oral medication by which his sight may be governed under it for a few days, him being in that dark room.
Then let him gradually leave the house, and converse in his own rooms.
And know that in the cautery the student is not excused from vision sometimes: for then let him dare the operation.
And now indeed there has come to us a certain one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that there was made in Alayrach a perforated tube, by which water is sucked.
Truly therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has made it: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of tube, that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon them.
Let them be made of bronze properly; and let their ends be triangulated with this same subtlety, and the end sharp.
Forms of tube.
Concerning the care of flesh grown in the nose.
Chapter 24.
Sometimes diverse fleshy growths are produced in the nose, of which some resemble a many-legged scorpion; and of these there is cancerous flesh, stony, dark in color; and of these there is that which is soft flesh, not dark in color.
Therefore in that which of these fleshes is soft, not malignant, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you cause the infirm person to sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and throw a hook into those fleshes; then draw them outwards, and incise that which you have grasped of them with a thin sharp spatula from one side, until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
But if something remains of that whose excision is not possible, then shave it with one of the fine instruments easily, until nothing of it remains.
But if blood dominates you, or a warm abscess happens: then oppose it by that which is necessary: or it is of malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Then let vinegar, and water, or wine be thrown into the nose after the incision.
But if the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is now healthy.
If however the moisture does not penetrate as it ought, then know that within it is flesh grown in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then therefore it is necessary that you insert a linen thread which has a certain thickness, and tie many knots in it: and place between each knot the quantity of a finger, or less: and let the sick man contrive to send one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it similar to azer: and let him draw his breath, until it reaches the cavity, and comes out over his throat.
And indeed boys often do something similar to this in schools: and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Then take and saw the flesh with the knots which are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread: and put into the nose after wiping away the blood a pledget which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then finally put a lead tube in the nose for a few days, until it heals.
But if it needs treatment which dries, use that.
To make a head-purger, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: let it be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its channel similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for making a head-purger should be full, open; which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish of juices and liquids.
And this is the form of the instrument. Concerning the care of nasal polyps.
Chapter 25.
Often a polyp grows at the tip of the nose, and becomes large, and increases with the days, until its appearance becomes foul.
And because of that it is necessary that you cut it out at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it.
Then place on the location, either a cautery, or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed, until it becomes large, then consider, if it is stony, hard, dark in color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: because it is a cancerous abscess.
For many times I have seen, he who incised such an abscess, and great harm happened to him who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible in all of it, then empty the diseased area, and incise it without fear, without dread: and treat the place with that which dries and constricts, until it is healed.
Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when a discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, the operation benefits little, except in certain men.
Therefore, when something like that happens to someone, you ought to consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood: and then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture: then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the discontinuity are already separated, and each part has healed: then it is necessary that you scrape away all the part from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Then bring together the two lips with suture, and tighten them, and powder over it dragon's blood, and crushed olibanum: and put over the powders a piece of diachylon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bandaged for two or three days.
Then untie it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is to bring together the discontinuity, either with needles, as we have narrated in the suturing of the belly: or bring together the discontinuity with thread, as I have let you know.
Concerning the extraction of knots from the lips.
Chapter XXVII. Many people indeed often have hard abscesses in their inner lips similar to grains of barley: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the lip, and incise over each knot, and lift it with a hook, and incise it on every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with crushed alum, until the bleeding stops.
Then let it be washed with vinegar, and let the place be treated with it, where there is astringency, until the wounds are healed.
Concerning the incision of proud flesh upon the gum.
Chapter XXVIII. Often there grows upon the gum an excessive flesh, which the ancients called abuluss.
Therefore it is necessary that you suspend it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and incise it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow.
Then place upon the place pounded alum, or other astringent, drying powders.
But if that flesh returns after treatment—for often it returns—then incise it a second time and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, foul crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth, on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, and sometimes they blacken and turn yellow and green, until corruption from them reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through it.
Therefore you ought to make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth on which you see crusts and things like sand, until nothing of them remains; and similarly deal with the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other things until they are cleaned.
If therefore that which is in them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second, and a third, until finally you achieve what you wish.
And know that a tooth needs scrapers of diverse forms, many shapes, according to what is prepared for your operation; because the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from below is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
And these forms of scrapers should be prepared beforehand, which you see.
Concerning the extraction of aching teeth.
Chapter 30.
It is necessary that you treat the tooth for its pain with all skill, and delay in its extraction.
For there is nothing that can replace it when it is eradicated: because it is a sublime substance: until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary, when the patient is compelled to eradicate it, that the aching tooth be firmly and surely grasped by you.
For often pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a sound tooth and eradicates it: then the pain does not depart, until the diseased tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen this from the practice of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is ascertained by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Then place large forceps on it in a good position, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have now held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it on every side easily, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
But if the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and tighten it with the end of a thin rod, so that it is not broken at the time of your tightening upon it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you act carefully with scarification around the gum on every side very much.
And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the patient from that evil which is greater than his first pain.
And beware lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness concerning its eradication, except that they administer what we have narrated.
For very often they cause great illnesses to happen to men, which are more difficult to break, and all, or some of its roots remain; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have often testified to that. Then let it be rinsed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt. But if a flow of blood should occur from the places (for it often happens), then grind something of zegi, and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved, let them be of long ends, short handle, thick, so that they do not bend when pressure is applied with them to the tooth: let them be like you see of thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not yield to each other, nor bend: of short ends, and let them be made of good iron, or of properly made steel, of straight ends: and at their ends let there be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with a decent, strong constriction.
And sometimes the ends are made like the shape of the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of broken jaw bones.
Chapter XXXI.
When, in the eradication of a tooth, something of it remains, then it is necessary that you place a poultice with butter on the place for one or two days, until the place softens: then introduce into it forceps, or pincers; the ends of which are similar to the mouth of a bird which is called a stork.
This, however, is the shape of the forceps.
Let their ends be made like a file within: or like aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you scrape above the root, and uncover all the flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called a small lever, of which this is the form.
Let the extremity be short, somewhat thick: and let it not be brittle, lest it break.
If therefore the root comes out through it, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments, whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular at the end, in which there is a certain thickness.
The form of a triangular end, slender.
It is also helped with this instrument having two branches, of which this is the form. And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the matter of teeth.
Also let there be help with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this form, of a twisted triangular end, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break: and let it not be soaked.
And know that the instruments for teeth are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the skillful artisan, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument, according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Because there are illnesses to which the ancients did not describe an instrument, because of the diversity of their kinds.
But if a bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then examine it in its place with that which is suitable to it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a gouge, whose form is this.
Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone may be tightened, or held with it, and not escape and move, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then shave it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the sawing of teeth projecting above others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth project not according to their natural course, the form becomes foul thereby; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those who are for sale.
For if a tooth is grown after another tooth, and is not located, or its sawing or filing is possible, then eradicate it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then incise it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of strong iron, very sharp at the end.
And let your incision, by which you incise it, be over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
But if it is prominent and exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of iron, of which this is the form.
Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle of very small points, like a file with which needles are made; with which the tooth may be filed little by little over many days easily, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, finally shave it with certain razors.
But if it is a tooth, from which a part is broken, and injures the tongue: then it is necessary that you file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even: and smoothed, and does not injure the tongue, nor impair speech.
Concerning the fastening of teeth with gold threads.
Chapter 33.
When a shaking and movement happens to the front teeth from a blow or a fall: and the sick person cannot bite on what he eats so that it does not fall out: and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment has not worked: then the method is that they be fastened with gold thread; because silver turns green and rots after a time; but gold never changes.
And let the thread be medium in fineness and thickness according to the amount it takes between the teeth.
And the manner of fastening is that you take a thread, and insert the double of it between two healthy teeth; then weave with the two ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether it is one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving until the part from which you began; and tighten your hand with skill and wisdom until it is not moved at all; and let your tightening of the thread be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors; and join both, and twist them together; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue; then let it remain so bound.
But if it loosens or is cut, tighten them with another thread, and it will remain thus for the whole time.
And this is the form of the teeth, and the manner of fastening two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after the fall of both, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and this is done only by a skillful, prudent, and experienced craftsman.
And sometimes something is fitted from the bones of animals; and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and is placed in the place from which the tooth is supported and tightened, as we have said; and it remains, and serves for a long time.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which happens under the tongue and prevents speech.
Chapter 34.
But if in it there is something of hardness and knotting, and it is from the healing of a wound: then throw a hook into it, and split it across, until you incise the ligament, and the knotting is loosened.
But if a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded alum on the place. But if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a slow cautery, which is suitable for it; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed. Concerning the extraction of a ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Chapter 35.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it is magnified so much that it fills the mouth.
If therefore you see it of a dark or black color, hard, to which the sick person feels no sensation: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
And if it inclines to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw in it a hook, and incise it with a thin spatula, and free it from every part.
But if blood overcomes you in the hour of your operation, then place on it crushed alum until the blood is stopped: then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Then let it be washed with vinegar and salt: and cure it with the remaining treatment suitable for it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will perforate it: or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then it must be incised.
And the operation in it is that you should consider before its operation, if the heat of its abscess has quieted completely, or is lessened by some diminution: then therefore make the sick person sit before the sun, and let his head be in your bosom: and open his mouth, and let a servant take [a tool] between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, of which this is the form. Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
Therefore, when you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your vision falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you draw something of the tunics with it.
Then incise it with an instrument, of which this is the form which follows.
It is similar to scissors; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other sharply: therefore take care that it is made of tempered iron, or imbued alfuled.
But if this instrument is not present, then incise it with a spatula, of which this is the form.
Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you incise one tonsil, incise the other according to this same kind of incision.
Then after the incision let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
But if a flow of blood happens to him, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and things similar to them from among the styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses are produced in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore incise them according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I indeed once treated a woman of an abscess which had formed between her throat, which drew towards blackness, little sensation, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her eating, and drinking water: and she had already come to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches until they came out above the two openings of the nose.
Therefore I hastened, and fixed a hook in one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out from it.
Then I cut it off where it was grasped from the opening of the nose.
Then I did the same to that which protruded from the other opening of the nose.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it: therefore the woman's throat was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Therefore I did not cease to incise that abscess many times for a long time: and the abscess succeeded in the place of that which I incised, until it was greatly prolonged and with it that.
Therefore I devised, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore it stopped from increasing: then I went away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
Concerning the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Chapter 37.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and becomes an abscess, and is long: then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot abscess has subsided from it, and it is thin: then it is necessary to incise it.
And that which is gathered from it is round, and has no length, and is bloody, or brown, or black, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
For in it there is fear for the patient.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I described, from its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit facing the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument, the description of which preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula, and pull it downwards: and incise it with one of the two instruments which I described in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you not incise from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise more of it, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision use what we have described in the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision: then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
And the method of cauterization in it is not, except with a sharp instrument; and it is that you place the head of the patient in your bosom.
Then press his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Then take of the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterizing, and mix with it unquenched lime, and put it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the form.
Let the extremity of it in which the medicine is placed have a concavity, like the concavity of a spoon's bowl.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself; and let the patient be lying on his side, so that the saliva may run from his mouth from the inside of the medicine, so that nothing from it may descend to his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you should hold it over the uvula for the amount of half an hour, until you see it now blackened, and the biting of the medicine calmed.
And if you wish to take a pledget, and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the pledget with medicine, and insert the spoon with the pledget into the cannula from above, until the pledget adheres to the uvula. Do this many times, until you achieve what you wish of the cauterization of the uvula.
Then leave it: for it itself dries and falls after three days, or four.
But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the uvula with a pledget soaked in butter, and clean with it what is around it of the medicine: and rinse with cold water.
And it is to be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Therefore this method of treatment is healthier than incision and further removed from fear.
And sometimes the uvula is also treated with something finer than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, in this way.
Take calamint, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sage, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and combine all of them, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be luted with clay properly: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Let it be made of silver or bronze: and let the end, in which a pomegranate is placed, be inserted into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor ascends to the uvula through a small tube, until the uvula is much darkened.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the arrival of the abscess.
For it often adds to the abscess: and it is not fitting that you do it except at the decline of its hot abscess.
But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and place on its end an eggshell: so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned; because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is among good treatments with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often a bone, or fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore it is necessary that you extract what of them is apparent upon which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument towards the sun, and it is made clear to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the infirm person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the infirm person swallow a piece of turnip, or the root of lettuce, or swallow a morsel of dry bread: or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge; and tie it on a thread, then let him swallow it.
When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it comes out. If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be somewhat thicker than a radius, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which he may easily insert into his throat; and let him have his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing should occur, and let him push the bone or spine with it, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
But that the sick man should insert it is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing; and let him push it downwards, or draw his hand with the instrument upwards, all of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter 39.
When a leech is medicated with that which I mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then examine in the throat of the sick man before the sun, or by the sun, after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
If therefore your sight falls upon a leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine tweezers carefully.
But if it is not possible with them: then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the throat of the sick man as far as the throat: then insert into the concavity of the cannula an iron heated with fire.
Do this many times: and let the sick man abstain from water the whole day.
Then let him take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water.
But if it does not come out with what we have recounted, then fumigate the sick man with bugs, or with asafoetida with the instrument which I recounted in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this many times, because it itself will fall.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot is covered with a cover, in the middle of which there is a hole: and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then throw in the fumigation, and let the sick man put his mouth to the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has now reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall.
But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt and garlic, and not drink water. Therefore it is necessary that it come out with this regime.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon the eye itself.
It is similar to forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is a roughness like a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go of it completely.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and care in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to what comes to mind of them, namely one, and one in this book: and they differ in their perforation, and incision of them in two ways.
One of which is from the species of the abscess itself, and that which it contains of humors.
And the second method is because of the places in which it happens in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And among abscesses there are some which it is not necessary to perforate except after the maturation of the pus in them and its completion: and among them there are some which it is necessary to perforate while they are raw, and not matured according to completion.
Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration is prolonged until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: wherefore it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that limb.
Or there is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that member, or through it the principal member.
Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it immaturely: and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and a fistula be formed, or it be formed in its end which is not healed. It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of an abscess which has matured according to its completion: and that is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and the other signs. And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of more vehement eminence: and let the perforation go in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and lastly in all equal places, in which there is no reflection.
However, in those which are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
When however the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you delay its perforation, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and foulness, and perhaps its lips and its depth will harden.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body in necessity: or according to that which the member needs.
And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a large perforation: or many incisions according to the likeness of the magnitude of the abscess.
And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be hollowed out: and incised when it has already become like a cloth, and has become at the point that it is already dead: as that which happens in many, such as boils and buboes.
And some of them are those which are cut with a three-angled incision.
And of them is that which is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like the abscess of the groin.
And some of them are those in which a round incision and a lunate incision are administered: and similar to them from among the incisions.
That, however, which does not have a head, such as are soft superficial abscesses, it is necessary that you perforate it with a superficial or only flat perforation.
And it is necessary, when an abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, that you do not hasten and extract all the pus at that time:  but rather extract a part of it from it.
Then stop up the abscess until another day.
Then extract something of the pus again.
Do this many times gradually, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old, decrepit person; for the animal spirit is often dissolved from the body with the exit of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
Therefore if the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply linen cloths, or old cotton.
And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures of perforation, then it is necessary that you insert a linen cloth into each fissure, until they meet each other.
And if in the abscess you have cut away part of the skin, or have hollowed it out around the edges: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is woven, or is scraped with flax lint without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them: and apply it to the place of bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have recounted in many places of this our book, and from the division.
But if it is in the winter time, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse little powders with warm wine and oil: and place them on the places.
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place powders soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all that cold.
Until when it shall be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you resolve the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer in its treatment that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
This therefore is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the way of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment summarily individually.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the skin of the head.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the species of Nodes, which contain tunics, which are sacs for them: as if they themselves were the wattles of a hen.
And their species are many.
Some of them are fatty; and some of them contain a humidity similar to mud; and some of them contain a humidity similar to cooked vegetables and porridges; and similar things; and some of them are hard, like stone.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as an artery does not oppose their incision.
And the operation in their incision is that you should explore them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if it is that which contains humidity, then incise it with a longitudinal incision, a superficial incision: according to this form.
And begin with the incision from line b. to line g. When therefore the humidity is evacuated, then scrape out the cyst which contains that humidity, and do not leave anything of it at all.
For very often it returns, if anything of it remains. Then dip a pledget in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remains of the cyst. Then repeat on it a pledget with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
But if the abscess contains a fatty node, then cut it according to this form, the incision having the form of a cross; and throw hooks between the lips of the incision, and scrape it from every part; and try your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
But if an artery opposes you, then do what I shall tell you afterwards.
And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said. And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it is of little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in certain men, with which there is entirely no moisture.
Or place their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus may be relieved downwards.
Then treat them with what is suitable for them from treatment.
Concerning the incision of the Strophulae in the neck.
Chapter XLII.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those which of them occur in the neck, there is one, and many: and they are generated from one another: and every Strophula of them is within its own tunic, just as it is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the kinds of these Strophulae are many.
And of them some are stony: and of them some contain humors: and of them some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that one of them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose evident color is near to that of the skin, and moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the jugular vein, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you ought to cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line b to the line g, and flay it from every side: and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is important to be cautious, lest a vein or nerve be cut.
And let the spatula not be very sharp: lest it injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
But if you cut a vein or an artery, or it prevents you from operating, then put on the wound crushed egg-white, or some powders which staunch blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to suppurate.
For the blood is stanched. Therefore return to your operation until you complete it.
Then take care of it.
If the entire pustule is incised, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and dress it immediately, after you see that absolutely no excess remains.
But if you see that excess remains because of the size of the pustule, then it is necessary that you proceed to incise its root and extract it: and administer the suture which we have described.
And which of the pustules contains moisture, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that the place of its maturity appears to you: and place the perforation from that which follows the lower part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer after the perforation a pledget with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound to be already cleansed: then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it heals.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients said that this incision is in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their speech.
However, in those having quinsy, the incision of the epiglottis must be avoided: since no help is done by it; because all the veins and the lung are weak.
Truly in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in the two tonsils, when there is no illness in the trachea, it is necessary to use incision of the epiglottis, to escape from the destruction which happens from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do it, we must incise the epiglottis between three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across, in that which is between two circles, to the extent that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage: and indeed this place is suitable for incision, since it is free from flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
But if the physician is timid, then it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then he should cut the skin, until when he arrives at the trachea: he should avoid a blood vessel, if he sees any of them.
Then he should cut the membrane which we have described: and the incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm which comes out of it, with that which is broken, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis.
The sum of this discourse which we have narrated is this:  unless they see that one of these abscesses has already blocked the throat of the patient, and the patient is close to death, and wishes his breathing to be cut: they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient breathes through the wound site with a certain respiration, and is saved from death; and for this reason they order that the wound be left open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed, and its malignancy lasts for three days, or thereabouts: then they order the wound to be sewn and cared for until it is healed.
And that which I saw with my own eyes is that a maidservant took a knife and put it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the windpipe.
And I was called to her treatment, and I found her roaring like the roar of the dying.
I therefore uncovered the wound, and found little blood which had flowed from the wound.
Therefore I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor the gullet; and wind was coming out from the wound.
I therefore cleansed and sutured the wound, and treated it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice: and after some days she returned to her better condition.
Therefore I say: that in the incision of the epiglottis there is no fear.
Concerning the incision of a throat hernia.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is found much in women.
And it is according to two methods: for it is either natural or accidental. In the natural one certainly there is no pus.
The accidental one however is according to two methods: of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
And the other method is similar to an abscess which comes from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and it is not necessary that presumption be made to it with iron, except in that which is small: and you prove it, and investigate it with a probe.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected with any veins: then cut it, just as nodes are cut: and extract it with what contains it from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then explore the whole of it.
Then treat the place with what is necessary from treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision upon the kinds of nodes.
Chapter XLV. There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary that I relate here the difference between a Node and an Exitura, since it causes doubt. I say therefore, that when an Exitura is heat, and fever, and vehement pains, until the boiling over of superfluity is settled, and putrefaction is completed: then indeed fever and heat are quiet.
With a Node however there is not heat, nor fever, nor pains, and a sifachin cyst contains them, which is a proper sac for them, and is according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and larger and smaller.
And they are according to two kinds: either fat: or they contain humidity.
And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division. Therefore it is necessary, when you arrive at the treatment of a Node, that you examine it, and investigate it firstly with an instrument which is called Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter which is after this.
And the method of investigating abscesses, and all Nodes is, that you take this instrument, and introduce it into the most humid place, which you find in the abscess: and you revolve your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Then move your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider that which comes forth in its track.
If therefore a running moisture comes forth, whatever its colour may be: then incise it with a superficial incision, according to what I said in the other abscesses.
And if no moisture comes forth in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty: therefore incise it above with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from every part with ease: and keep the cyst if you can over it, so that you extract it whole with the Node.
But if the cyst bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piecemeal, until nothing of it remains.
For if a little or much of it remains, the Node returns to a great extent.
But if it overcomes you, and a little remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with certain sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place over it what sits a hot abscess, and treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
If therefore the Node is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with that which incarnates. But if you have a pulsating or non-pulsating vein opposite: then hasten, and fill the place with pounded zegi, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of the blood ceases: then return to incising what remains of the Node.
Concerning the instruments for cutting and perforation.
Chapter XLVI.
Of these are the shapes of the intromittents, and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and of them there is a medium one, and of them there is a small one.
Let them be made of well-tempered iron, square-ended, so that they readily enter the abscess.
And these are the shapes of the perforating instruments, and one of them is called a beris, that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating by means of them abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes from what is between them of bones.
And others are made round, smooth, soft, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of citrine, or of bronze, or iron, or silver. And the best of them are those which are made of citrine.
And they are also made from black lead, which are suitable for investigating by means of them fistulas, whose cavities have reflections, so that they are reflected with their softness along with those reflections.
And again they are of three kinds. Because among them are long ones, among them medium ones, and among them short ones, according to the amount of the size of the fistula and its stricture. The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds. Because among them are simple ones, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
And among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and skinned: and they are of three kinds: for among them is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Their ends with which the cutting is done are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except that with them help is given in the skinning of nodes for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that the sick man may be healed by them, and find some tranquility from the burning which he finds in the skinning of an abscess.
These are the magdae, and they are of three kinds.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to a spatula with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end is a hidden spatula-point: and in it it runs inwards and outwards when you wish, as you see.
The shape of the spatulas which are hidden between the fingers in the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The shapes of the cupping-glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat long, as you see: and let them be thin.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping-glasses be with you, large and small: so that you may cut off blood with speed when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
However, do not use them in cutting off blood in every place of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the thighs of the leg, and the hip, and the thighs of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar to them, from fleshy, moist places.
And sometimes small instruments are made from them, similar to the husks of pistachios, according to their form: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Concerning the care of the nipples of men which are similar to the nipples of women.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the nipples of some men swell upon the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they are similar to the nipples of women: and they remain badly festering.
He who therefore abhors that, ought to cut above the nipples with a lunar incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then flay all the fat.
Afterwards fill the wound with incarnative medicine.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and tend it until it is healed.
But if the nipple declines downwards, and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that it be split on its two upper sides with two incisions similar to the lunar figure, each of which is joined with the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards flay the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said of suture and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it is healed.
But if you do not complete the incision of what you ought to incise, because of the patient's restlessness, or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a pledget soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then tend it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess which occurs under the armpit.
Chapter XLVIII. Those abscesses which occur under the armpit are of the hard kinds of strumae, which contain cysts, and some of them contain fluids.
Those therefore which contain fluids ought to be incised with a lunate incision, in this manner, from line b. to line g.  When therefore all that is in the abscess of pus is evacuated, then fill it with old tow, and leave it until another day.
Then let the tow be removed, and let it be treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
But if the abscess is of the kind of nodes of strumae, then incise it as we said in the section on strumae equally.
But if the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said previously.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs because of an artery and vein.
Chapter 49.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it is consolidated, then an abscess often results from this; and similarly it happens with a vein also, that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a grating in it.
And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is a mistake, especially that which is under the armpits and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Therefore, its treatment with iron must be avoided, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, must be avoided.
Therefore, for that which is from the swelling of the opening of an artery, make a longitudinal incision in the skin.
Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery; and free it from the tunics until it is uncovered.
Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with double thread in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood which is in it flows out, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer a treatment which produces pus, until the ligatures fall off; afterwards treat it with ointments suitable for it, until it is healed.
But if there is an abscess because of a section of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what you can of the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Then tie the abscess with a good ligature: according to what I said to you in the ligature of a grape, from two parts with two ends of thread. But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the needle: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until when comes out what is in it: then incise the superfluous skin, and leave what is tied of it.
Then place on it a small pillow which you have submerged in wine and oil.
Then administer the treatment, which is done with linen cloths and ointments, until it is healed.
Concerning an abscess which happens from the twisting of the nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess happens in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess happens in the nerves: which happens in them through a blow, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things; and it happens mostly in the places of the joints, or the heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many conditions without pain: and when it is squeezed forcefully, the sick person feels in it something like numbness.
And it is not an abscess collected deep in the body, indeed it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and it does not go forward, or before, nor backward behind.
Therefore, what is of them in the joints, it is not necessary that it be invaded with iron.
Perhaps, indeed, a contraction will happen.
But in that which of them is in the head, or in the forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it: then remove it, and close the wound with suture: and treat it, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which happens in the abdomen.
Chapter 51. It happens to some men many times in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies,  thelil, which are called Fungalia, because of their similarity to fungi.
Whose root is slender, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted.
And some of them are small; and some of them become very large.
And indeed I myself have seen a man, and in his belly were two thelil, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, small root, and their lips were inverted, and they were split, and moisture always flowed from them.
Therefore I cut them, and found in one about eighteen ounces in weight and in the other about six ounces. And the operation in cutting them is that you should consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the thelil is white, moist, with a slender root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and let cauteries be ready for you in the fire.
For very often much blood is expelled during its section: therefore, if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it quickly.
But if you see the patient is fearful and timid of incision with iron, then take a suitably made lead thread, and tie the thelil with it: the method of which is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead ligature.
Therefore do not cease tightening the lead, as often as it presses on the thelil, until it is cut off, and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the thelil has a thick root, then there is something of fear and dread in its incision: especially that which is in the belly.
Nevertheless, it is possible to incise half of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you presume to incise a thelil which is brown in color, of little feeling, foul in appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess; and I shall come to the remembrance of Cancer after this.
Concerning the treatment of the protrusion of the umbilicus.
Chapter 52.
A protrusion of the umbilicus happens from many causes.
Or from fissures of the fascia which is over the belly; and from it protrudes fat or intestine, according as it happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood which flows from a vein or from an artery, according to what has been said before.
Or from wind constricted there.
But if it is because of a fissure of the fascia and a protrusion of fat, then it is similar in color to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain; and it appears in various places.
And if it is because of the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is, with that which we have narrated, of more significant variety.
Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is much magnified at the entrance of the bath, and considerable effort.
If however it is because of moisture, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor constricted, nor is anything added.
But if it is because of blood, then with these signs a swelling appears tending towards blackness.
If however it is because of a growth of flesh: then it is a serious swelling, large, hard, and fixed according to a single quantity.
If however it is because of wind, then its touch is soft. And the operation in that is, that you consider then, if the protrusion of the navel is because of blood of an artery, or vein, or wind: then it is necessary that you are forbidden from its treatment.
For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of swellings because of an artery and vein.
But if the protrusion of the navel is because of intestine, or hernia: then it is necessary that you instruct the patient, insofar as he holds his breath, and stands standing stretched out.
Then mark with a cautery around the whole navel.
Afterwards instruct him, that he lie on his back between your hands.
Then surround with a broad spatula around the navel over the place which you marked with a cautery.
Afterwards extend the middle of the abscess upwards, with a large hook.
Then tie it around firmly with thread, or with a strong silk cord: and let the knot of the ligature be secure.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligature.
If therefore you find it already seized by the ligature: then pull on the ligature, and insert your index finger, and push the intestine into the interior of the abdomen: and if you find a hernia, then seize it with a hook, and incise its excess.
But if an artery or vein is contrary to you, then surround it greatly.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles into the circumference which you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then constrict the abscess in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls by itself: or incise it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments, until it is healed.
But if the prominence of the umbilicus is from raw flesh in it, or from humidity: then it is necessary that you hollow out the abscess, as we said.
And extract the blood, or humidity, which you find in it.
Then treat it with what solidifies the place.
Concerning the care of cancer. Chapter 53.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it: nor have I seen another before me who has succeeded in it.
And the operation in it, when it is situated as we have said, is that you precede, and relieve the patient of black bile sometimes.
Then phlebotomize him if you find him with manifest repletion.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation, in which he is placed with the operation.
Then throw hooks into the Cancer which are suitable for it.
Afterwards hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to exploration, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood run, and do not cut it off quickly, but rather press the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever is possible there of instruments.
But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter 54.
We have already recounted in the division the types of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs, and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only a type of ascites alone; and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympanitis, nor in the case of hyposarca entirely, for that is deadly.
When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanitis, with medicines, and your treatment has not helped, then consider.
For if the patient has already suffered weakness, or has another illness besides dropsy, such as a cough, or diarrhea, and things like that, then beware of treating him with iron, because that is dangerous.
But if you see a patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the method of operation in him is that you raise the standing patient between your hands, and the assistant behind him presses his abdomen with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a spiny spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two sharp parts, long, the sharp end like a spatula.
However, let there be some shortness in it gradually, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation as far as the intestine and injure it.
Then consider.
For if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen the incision from the navel by the amount of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubis.
But if the generation of dropsy is due to illness of the liver, then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Then perforate the whole skin with an instrument.
Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with a spatula between the skin and the fat, as if you are flaying it; and let the amount that is flayed be the amount of a fingernail, or thereabouts.
Then perforate the fat until the spatula reaches the empty place; and that is the place of the water.
Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument, of which this is the form.
And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: which in its lower part has a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other: and its end is incised, according to the manner of the incision of a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a moderate amount.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the patient dies from the dissolution of his vital spirit; or a syncope occurs to him which approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the amount of his strength, and according to what the patient's conditions signify to you from the strength of his pulse, and from the goodness of it.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Which is because it is immediately retained because of the skin which retains the opening which is on the sifac: of which I have spoken, so that you pierce it according to that method.
Then repeat the instrument on the following day, if you see the patient tolerating it: and also withdraw a small quantity of water. Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until nothing remains of the water but a little.
But if you are worried about the patient, and you leave a large amount of water: then treat him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and let him suffer from thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water: according to what I have narrated in what precedes.
Concerning the care of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Chapter 55. When one of the infants comes forth from the womb of its mother, and its urinary passage is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is not in its proper place.
Therefore it is necessary to help with its perforation immediately upon birth with a very fine spatula, according to this form.
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening and bind it: and keep it in for three or four days.
When therefore he wishes to urinate, let it be removed, and he will urinate.
Then replace it.
And if you do not put in lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
But he whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are injured.
That is because, of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis; wherefore he cannot urinate forwards, until he raises his penis with his hand upwards. Nor is there generation for him, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul disease.
And the method of operation in this case is that the patient is laid on his back.
Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and incise the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp instrument, or a sharp spatula: just as is the incision of a reed, or as you shave something, so that the middle of it comes to resemble the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as it ought.
And beware in your operation of a flow of blood.
For that often happens.
Therefore oppose to it that which stops blood, and care for the wound, until it is healed.
Concerning Albucasis, what happens in the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter 56.
These things often happen to the penis according to Albucasis, and it is a protrusion of foul flesh.
And of it, one is malignant, and another not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a thin hook, and you should cut it away until you cleanse it entirely.
Then place on it lint soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterwards with diafinicon ointment until it heals.
But if the Albucasis is malignant, of foul colour, then it is necessary that you apply a cautery to it after its incision and shaving.
But if the Albucasis is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the Albucasis is between the foreskin, and part of it outside: then it is necessary that you remove the Albucasis which is inside first, until when it heals, then treat the outside: because when you treat it simultaneously, the foreskin is not secured from being perforated.
And now blackness and corruption also happen in the testicles and foreskin.
Therefore, it is necessary that you hollow out everything that is already blackened, and that wants to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Then spread over it afterwards with honey which has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate rinds, and of crushed, sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
But if a flow of blood happens, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For a cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for a flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted.
But if the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole thing is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary that you introduce into the passage of the penis a small tube of lead, so that the sick man may urinate over it.
In the adhesion, however, of the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this adhesion indeed does not happen, except in him whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon it: and sometimes adhesion happens because of a wound, or an abscess: therefore it is necessary that you scrape it with a blunt spatula, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
But if it is difficult to distinguish them exactly, then it is necessary that you scrape something from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
That is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it is perforated because of its thinness quickly.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then it should be treated with astringent wine, until it is consolidated. Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the cure of an error happening to them.
Chapter 57.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we should mark in it a better operation, and a lighter way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books; because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
That is, because I have found the greater part of surgeons and phlebotomists use cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and they use cautery, and binding with thread, and incision with a nail.
And I indeed have already tested all these methods, and I have not found a better one than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, very often the skin escapes.
Because the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is incised, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is forced to make an incision to cut the other, and future pain.
And with the cleansing which is done by cautery, that is, a finger-shaped instrument which seamstresses use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not secured: because perhaps it enters its opening.
But in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron escapes, and spoils your operation: and indeed a child's skin is short by nature, and very often they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen that.
However, cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread has revealed a good method to me: because scissors are proportional in incision: therefore, because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation in one time: and a compression is made with a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis from every side, with which no error falls at all.
And the proper method of operation is that you make the child, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, understand that you are not doing anything except tying a thread around his penis: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way that is possible for you, from what his intelligence receives.
Then insert your hand to his penis, and inflate the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it from the dirt that has gathered on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Afterwards tie a second ligature a little lower down. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature with a good hold, and incise between the two ligatures.
Then raise the skin quickly upwards, and draw out the head of the rod.
Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better) and put powder on top: and over the powder a cloth in which is spread the yolk of an egg boiled in rosewater, beaten with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on it until the next day: and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Now the shape of the forceps for cleansing is this.
Let the two ends be blunt, and let them be meeting: lest a branch of the nail come out in them: and let the length of the two sharpened parts be like the length of the two handles equally.
An error however occurring in cleansing is: because perhaps the whole inner skin escapes, or a part of it at the incision. Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your nail before the suppuration of the place: and incise it according to equality.
But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then draw it out with a hook, and incise it.
But if three days pass it, and what is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated: then leave it, until the warm abscess settles, and flay it easily, and incise it as it is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod.
For that will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders, which we have recounted in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the higher parts, that also will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Chapter 58.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and similar things from those which we have mentioned in the divisions of treatment.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that the patient be bent over on his knees.
Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as possible.
Therefore, the neck of the bladder is compressed to expel the stone backwards: wherefore the urine is released.
But if it is not released by what we have said, and the matter is severe for the patient: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like the quill of a bird's feather in the slenderness of a ray, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: to which there is a slender tube at its head.
And the method of exiting urine through it is that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton at its end, a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if anything of the wool is superfluous, but insert it into the tube forcefully, like an elevator.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and make the patient sit on a seat, and rub the bladder and its neck with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the penis easily, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Then double it upwards from the part of the navel. Then push the syringe inside it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has now reached the empty thing: and this is not done according to this order, except because the passage, in which it goes, is one in which there is tortuosity.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For the urine will follow the wool.
Then draw it out, and make the urine run through the urinary passage: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease doing that, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
For it is deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
And the concave place, in which is that which impels, should be according to the quantity which fills it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, the moisture is drawn in: and when it is impelled, it is expelled with it to a distance: according to what the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is thrown in the battles of Mars.
Therefore, when you wish to throw moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with it that which impels upwards, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then insert its end into the tube, as we have described in the syringe.
Then impel the moisture with that which impels it; for then the moisture immediately arrives at the bladder, so that the patient feels it. The shape of a slender clyster by which the bladder is clysterized.
Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they are rolled up. Then gather the circle, as the alsofratu is gathered: after you put into it what you want of moisture, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Concerning the extraction of a stone.
Chapter LX. Now we have spoken in the division of the kinds of stone, and its cure with medicines: and I have spoken of the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs of all of it: and I have spoken of the stone in which operation with the hand and incision falls: and it is the stone generated in the bladder properly: and that which is fixed in the urethra: and I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that the stone generated in the bladder happens most to boys.
And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its thinness: and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs his penis, and labors with it, and often it hangs down. Then it is raised, and the anus comes out with it in many of them.
And the healing of boys is easy, until they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in old men.
In young men, however, it is moderate, in that which is between that: and whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if small, the treatment is the opposite.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with a clyster, which draws out all the stool that is in his intestines; for it sometimes prevents the finding of the stone during the search. Then let the patient be taken with his feet up, and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or rise from a high place sometimes.
Then make him sit prepared between your hands, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the whole bladder may slope downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately with the incision upon it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a grown young man: and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place, of which you wish to make an incision: and instruct the assistant, that he press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant, that he extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand, that he remove the skin, which is under the testicles in the part from the place where is the incision.
Then insert the cutting instrument, whose form is this.
And cut in that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide externally, and narrow internally, according to the amount that the exit of the stone from it is not greater.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
And know that of a stone there are angles and edges, wherefore its exit is difficult because of that.
And from it is a smooth one, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Therefore to that which has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
But if it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you work upon it: or that you tie around it with a suitable bandage, whose end is like the moon, which binds the stone, and does not slip from it: or that you insert beneath it a slender instrument, of curved end.
But if you cannot [work] upon it, then enlarge the opening a little.
But if something of blood overcomes you, cut it away with a scalpel.
If however the stone is more than one, then push the largest first towards the opening of the bladder.
Then incise upon it.
Afterwards push the small one after it: and similarly do if there are more than two.
But if it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut into it with a large incision.
Because one of two things happens to the patient, either that he dies, or that continuous urinary dribbling occurs to him; because the place does not completely heal.
But manage its expulsion until it comes out; or contrive its fracture with forceps until you extract it piecemeal.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot abscess may be seated.
Then lay the patient on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When therefore you have loosened it, bathe the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs in the wound, and corrosions, and similar things: as if the blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented from flowing out: and this is known from the passage of blood with urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and apply to every kind of it that which is suitable for its treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment that you bind the two hips together, and bring them together, because of the medicines which are placed on the area.
But if the stone is small, and is in the passage of the penis, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is prevented: then treat it with what I relate before you arrive at incision.
For many times you will be excused from incision by this treatment, for I have already proved it. And it is so that you take a perforator of  steel, whose form is this, with a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie with it the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the perforating iron into the penis easily, until the perforator arrives at the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually: and attempt its perforation, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis.
For it is broken, and comes out with the urine, and the sick man is healed.
But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something which prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures.
Then pull it out.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and clean the congealed blood which is in the wound.
And the ligature of the thread under the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not return to the bladder: and the other ligature above, except so that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, that you raise the skin upwards, so that it returns to its proper place, and covers the wound, as we said.
Concerning the extraction of a woman's stone.
Chapter LXI.
A stone is rarely generated in women.
But if a stone should happen to one of them, then the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for many reasons.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin. And a second is, because you do not find a woman who will uncover herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or has a husband.
A third is, because you do not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially manual operation.
And a fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity compels to that, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-skilled: and few are found.
If however you lack that, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a well-taught midwife in women's matters, or a woman who has some skill in this art: therefore make her present, and especially instruct her, that she may do all that you instruct her from the examination concerning the stone. First, that is, to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, let her constrict it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the afflicted woman, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with the greatest of her strength, until she arrives with it to the root of the thigh.
Then let her cut upon it at the opposite half of the vulva at the root of the thigh, on whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and let her finger not be removed from the stone, constricting under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Then let her insert a probe into that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then let her add to the incision according to a proportionate amount so that the stone exits from it.
And know that the kinds of stones are many. For among these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Know therefore its kinds, so that this may signify to you what you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place pounded alum, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stopped.
But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it tightly with a suitable bandage: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Then take care of the wound.
Therefore, when the sharpness of the blood has subsided after days, and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
Concerning the incision for watery hernia.
Chapter 62.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white membrane which is under the skin of the scrotum containing the testicle; and it is called a membrane. And sometimes it is in its own tunic, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it is considered a different testicle, and is the skin of the testicle between the white membrane which we have mentioned; and this does not happen except rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For either its color inclines toward yellow, or it is red and bloody, or foul and black, or it is white and watery, and this is what is most common.
For if it is in the white tunica we have spoken of, then the abscess is round, somewhat long like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
And if the moisture is in its own proper tunic, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and because of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white tunica, then it falls under the sense.
When therefore you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with the introduced square, whose form preceded.
According to that therefore which comes forth in the track of the introduced instrument, judge concerning that which is between it.
When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the patient, that he be bled if that is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him be laid on his back on something a little high, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit you on his left, and instruct the assistant, that he sit on his right, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the flank of the belly.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, even near to the pubis: and let the incision be made according to the straightness of a line equidistant which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane containing: and flay it and observe, or beware of this, that you cut it: and let your flaying with which you flay it, be from the part which hangs with the egg more: and subtly search with the flaying according to the quantity which is possible for you.
Then perforate the membrane full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water. Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the membrane upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles containing: and incise the membrane however it is possible for you to incise it, either with its totality, or piecemeal, especially its thin side.
For if you do not exquisitely search, in its incision there is no security, lest the water return.
But if the egg proceeds outwardly from its skin in the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the membrane, replace it.
Then unite the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
But if you find the egg corrupted by blackness or something else, then it is necessary that you ligate the vessels which are its suspensory, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut away the testicle with its suspensory, and extract the egg; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
But if water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two roots: therefore cut the other part as you did the other equally.
And if it seems to you that one operation is sufficient, then do it: then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool submerged in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside other wool which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the scrotum: and place on top folded cloths, which are compresses: and bind them on top with a bandage which has six [layers] according to this form.
Then two cloths are taken, and sewn, and filled with carded wool, according to this likeness: and let the ends which press be made of tow, or moist wool: and let them be gathered with a tightening in the lumbar region of the breeches: and one end should reach above the anus to the back, and the second should reach to the part of the pubis: and two ends below to the two hips, and two other ends to the two groins, and let the whole tightening be gathered in the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this root is treated artificially with cautery in place of incision with iron: and it is that you take a thin, knife-shaped cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have related: until when white pus containing water is revealed: then take a cautery, according to this form.
It is similar to a Greek letter.
Then perforate that pus with it, and it is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then extend the pus with hooks, and scrape it with a thin, heated cautery, and incise it as much as possible, until you eradicate all of it.
And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
But if a hot abscess, or blood flow, or something else opposes you during the incision, or during the cauterization, then you must treat what opposes you with the treatment that suits it, as has been stated before.
If, however, the patient is timid and does not await this operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I shall relate: and it is.
When it is confirmed to you by what we have said concerning the signs, that the abscess is watery, then you must make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatula; and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a pledget over the place, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water may run out; then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is opposition to the egress of water at the time when you perforate it, and this is only because a white membrane makes opposition at the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of the water, then it is necessary that you introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsies is drawn off, the form of which has preceded; or add to the operation of the wound a little.
And know that the water returns and is collected after six months, or thereabouts.
When therefore it is collected, then let it be perforated in the same way, and the sick person will pass his days.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy fistulas.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the incision upon this fistula, there is fear leading to destruction in many conditions.
Therefore its dismissal seems to me to be its salvation.
And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Therefore I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are formed: and this happens from many causes, namely. Either from an excess of something sharp or acrid, which is poured out to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it happens from a knotting of the arteries, and their swelling: as its mention has already preceded: or from a swelling of the veins.
Therefore, that which is from them [i.e., from among these causes] from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
That, however, which happens from the swelling of the veins, does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers. And now it is possible that an incision is made upon this kind and upon the remaining flesh: and it is, that you cut the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the testicle upward, and extract it with the white sheath; and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and ligate the vessels; and incise the spermatic cord after you free it from every part of the parts of the testicle.
If therefore the testicle is consolidated with those newly grown flesh, then it is necessary that you pull the testicle and incise it. And if there is adhesion between something of the sheath, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion, and incise it with a round incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you incise all of it, and extract the testicle, as we have said. When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas, which is with a vine.
Chapter LXIV.
A vine is a swelling enveloped in a certain wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and it makes movement and exercise, and walking, difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness is fear, because of that which preceded its remembrance.
Truly it is necessary that we speak of the operation on it according to what the first ones did. Therefore I say that it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then incise with a broad, sharp spatula with a transverse incision in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are uncovered.
Then flay from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the foul, corrupt humours.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which pus is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle may fall away.
For there is no harm through that.
But if it happens that a vein affects all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed with the vessels: lest the egg be deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and waste away, or dry up, and there be no benefit with them.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal fistula. Chapter 65.
Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from the sifach or its extension.
And these two types happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach.
Is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and there is an equal abscess towards the depth: because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And its sign when it is from a cutting of the sifach, because it causes a vehement pain suddenly from its beginning: and the abscess is different, appearing under the nearby skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes the zirbum exits with the intestine: and this is named intestinal Ramex, and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes excrement runs into the intestine, and is retained there: and with it is the destruction of the sick person: because it causes a bad pain, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of this kind of illness with iron there is fear: wherefore it is necessary that the case be avoided in it.
And the method of operation is, that you instruct the sick person to return the intestine with his hand to the inside of his cavity, if it obeys return.
Then he is laid supine upon his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin to the upper parts, and cut the whole skin of the testicles lengthwise.
Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and the incision should be of such a size that the egg may, if possible, come out of it.
Then flay the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until, when the white siphak is uncovered, hard on every side: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and absolutely loosen with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand: and with this extend the white siphak upwards with your left hand: and raise the egg with the siphak to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards: and you loosen the adhesion which is behind with complete loosening.
And search with your fingers, so that there may be nothing there of the intestine involved in the hard white siphak.
But if you find something of it, then push it downwards to the belly.
Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads: and insert it near the last siphak, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over some with a figure which is in the manner of a cross: and tie with them the alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until nothing from the vessels which nourish them can send anything to them: so that a hot abscess may not happen from it.
And place again a second ligature outside the first ligature, less than two fingers distant from it.
And after these two ligatures leave from the siphak, which is under the skin of the testicles, the amount of the size of a finger: and cut all the rest according to the roundness, and remove from it the testicle.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles an incision, from which blood and pus flows: as we have related in what precedes.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound: and apply the ligature which we have described.
And sometimes the white siphak which we have mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing the flow of blood.
For this often happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be moistened with warm water: and place on it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Concerning a cupping instrument with a tube.
Chapter 66.
In this cupping instrument I have not seen anyone who dared to operate on it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have narrated in the cupping instrument which is with a tube.
That is, to tie the vessels after the incision upon it with ease below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away; and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groins.
Chapter 67.
When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all hours: truly if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And that happens from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groins, as we have said.
That is, because the sifach is extended; then it softens, and the place suppurates, and protrudes.
And its cure is with a cautery, as its account preceded.
And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is, that the sick man lies on his back between your hands.
Then cut the place of the rupture of the abscesses and the protruding part, with a cut across, according to the amount of three fingers.
Then constrict the alsifak and what are under the skin, until when the white sifach is uncovered, which is under the skin that follows it.
Then take a radius, and place it on the protruding place of the sifach, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew two protruding places on the end of the radius from the sifach, and connect one of them with the other with a suture: then withdraw the end of the radius.
And do not cut the alsifach completely, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal rami. Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Therefore, when you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
For the sisach is contracted, and no prominence is added to the rupture.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, on account of which the flesh which is between them is softened, and its appearance is made foul.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked in its cure, that he make the sick man lie on his back, and cut away all the skin which is softened upon the natural skin. Then he shall bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, sew first the superfluity of the softened skin with three sutures, or four, and make the suture firm.
Then treat with the treatment of the other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
Concerning castration.
Chapter 69.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law: and because of that it would be permitted to me not to mention it in this my book: and its mention is not necessary, except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it: and that he should know the treatment of him to whom it has happened.
And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
I say therefore that castration is done in two ways. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and incision.
Now in that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to the touch.
But in castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Then treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite in two ways.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite from men is according to two ways.
One of them is that which appears in what follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like the vulva of a woman, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one species, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubis like very small male testicles, projecting outwardly: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them disappears.
Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second kind of men, however, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Concerning the incision of the frenulum, and of the prominent flesh in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXI.
The frenulum is perhaps added to a natural thing, until it is defiled and its appearance becomes foul; and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it is spread out like in men, and reaches even to coitus.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold the excess of the frenulum with the hand, or with a hook, and incise it; and do not be excessive in the incision, especially in the depth of the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
The flesh that arises is flesh which is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it goes out to the exterior according to the likeness of a tail; and because of that some first name the illness tailed.
Therefore it is necessary that we incise it just as we incise the frenulum, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the imperforate vulva of a woman.
Chapter 72.
Alratica is, that is, the vulva of a woman is not perforated, or the opening is small.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from a preceding illness: and this indeed happens either from added, grown flesh, or a thin membrane, or a thick one: and it happens either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
And the knowledge of it is made by the midwife's examination, if the obstruction is apparently close.
But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is from a thin membrane, and is close to the two lips: then hasten, and break it.
And it is so, that you place small cushions on the two lips.
Then place the index fingers of your two hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread.
Then extend the two lips forcefully, until the thin membrane is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and let the woman have intercourse every day, so that the place does not consolidate in another way.
But if the membrane is thick, dense, then it is necessary that you cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is of a fleshy nature, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it: and have with you medicines that stanch the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not consolidate quickly, hold it for several days: and administer a pledget of dry linen, then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And sometimes other fleshy growths are born in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be incised in this manner: provided it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, do not in any way oppose it with iron.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor rubea in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the orifices of the veins, until much blood flows from them continually.
When therefore hemorrhoids become old, they become athelil: and I have already spoken in the division of their species, and their signs: and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which not.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
But those of them which are in the orifice of the womb upon which the senses fall, are those which are cured.
It is necessary therefore that you introduce the woman into a cold house.
Then extend the athelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them from their roots.
Then pulverize upon them at the flow of blood from one of the incisive powders without mortification: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things to them.
Then let him push her feet against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and pomegranate bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it upon her back.
If therefore blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, apply cupping-glasses to the back and breasts, without scarification.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarthith, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the branches of alaulat, that is, aglanter, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the place.
When therefore the abscess is quiet, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth however is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
It is necessary therefore that you incise what appears of it, according to what I said in thelil equally: and treat it, until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of the Exitura which happens in the womb.
Chapter LXXIIII.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot abscess.
And I indeed already have spoken of all these illnesses and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of the hot abscess which happens in the womb, when it is of the abscesses which gather pus, and you wish to know how its opening is done with iron.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it redden: if numbness falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps in maturation, until when the acuteness of the symptoms rests.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which surpasses two seats, and she is reclined, or she is laid upon her back, and she draws her feet to the lower part of her belly: and let her hips be spread, and let her put her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable ligature to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the womb is opened.
Whose form comes in those which are later.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix with a radius the depth of the woman's womb: so that that which enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak.
But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions upon the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb may be prevented: and it is necessary that he place the handle, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that he hold the instrument, and that the attendant revolve the handle, until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a linen cloth submerged in rose oil: or in green oil, in which there is some styptic quality: and place the linen cloth, and draw out the section in the depth of the womb.
And place externally upon the womb, and upon the pubis, clean wool submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Then let it be treated after two days with an ointment which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is clysterized with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily, or long birthwort has been boiled: then it returns to the ointment.
But if the wound is hidden internally in the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from its treatment with iron, indeed treat it with that which we have said in the division.
On the teachings of midwives, how live embryos, having emerged according to a non-natural form, are to be treated.
Chapter 76.
It is necessary for the midwife to know first the form of a natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman being compressed downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and that which is upon her of the birth is lightened, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
But that which is besides this birth, is unnatural, blameworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus exits on its feet, and its body exits before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hands exit: or its belly exits: and perhaps it is turned about its neck, and similar things from blameworthy forms.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, skillful in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form of them, and what its nature is, and is signified by it, and is to be relied upon.
When the fetus exits head first in its natural way, and this is vehement for the woman, and birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and steam her vulva with a decoction of fenugreek, and with warm oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and let her break the secundine with it, and cut it with her nail, until that which is in it of moisture flows out: and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then instruct her after the clyster, that she be compressed: and make her sneeze with sneezing powder, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will exit immediately.
But if two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you reduce them with ease gradually.
But if it does not obey in entering, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upward: then shake the seat upon the ground: and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Therefore if the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then incise them, and extract the remainder of the fetus: and bind its hand with a cloth, and extract it evenly: for then it will come out.
The exit of the embryo upon its feet.
When the fetus comes out upon its feet, then it is necessary that you push them upward: then turn the fetus gradually: afterward straighten it.
Then let him take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When therefore they come out as far as the hips, then instruct him that he be compressed, and make him sneeze with sternutatories: for he will come out, if God wills.
And if he does not come out with what we have recounted, then return the fetus gradually, until you place him according to the natural form.
For then he will come out with an easy exit.
But if it is prevented with all that we have recounted: then take of mallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound all in a mortar with a good pounding: then anoint with it the vulva of the woman, and the lower part of her belly.
Then make her sit in warm water until it reaches the hypochondria.
Therefore, when you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make a pessary for her of myrrh: and insert it.
When therefore the pessary has remained for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze: and compress her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with gentle pressure.
For the fetus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus is over the knees and hands.
When it comes out in this manner, then he will succeed in introducing his hands gradually.
Then the woman will be laid on her neck, and her feet will hang downwards: and she will be lying on the bed, and will clasp her hands.
Then press gradually on her belly.
Then remove what is under her feet from the cushions, until she is prepared in the lower part.
But if the fetus does not come out, then take its feet, and move them with a strong movement.
Then press what is above the hypochondria gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Then let him insert his hands, and equalize the fetus gradually: and instruct the woman to bear down, until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Skill will be needed in the reduction of his hand.
But if he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman, and make her walk.
But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with a strong shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
But if childbirth seizes her, then make her sit on a seat.
Then strive at the reduction of the hand, and adjust the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to strain herself, until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with its hands outstretched, and its face is towards its mother's back.
It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it, and adjust it easily.
When therefore it is adjusted, then place on her vulva what we have recounted of oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to move gradually.
When therefore you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean to her right side.
Then instruct her to bear down; and make her sneeze with sneezing powders.
The exit of the prepared fetus is on the side.
When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your fingernail, until it is emptied of moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Then push the fetus inwards, until you place it as is proper: and instruct the woman to bear down several times: for it will itself exit easily.
The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Know that twins are very often born: and sometimes three, and four are born.
However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Five, however, is unnatural, and they do not live at all: and one afterbirth contains them, however many there are: and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing between them, attached to the navel of each of them.
And sometimes they come out as one fetus comes out by a natural, easy exit; and they come out by an unpraiseworthy exit, as we have narrated. But if some of them are difficult at birth, and they arrive at what we have spoken of concerning unnatural positions, then treat them as we have narrated: and let there be a skilled midwife, and let her do what she does with speed and slowness, and let her contrive according to every position with what is prepared for her from skill leading to health.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has been verified by me, that a woman miscarried and expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore all this ought to be in the knowledge of a midwife. For perhaps something similar will come to her; therefore let her oppose it with what is necessary.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division of medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then you ought to consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound health, and is not afflicted with any of the accidents from which loss is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on a bed, on her back, and her head be inclined lower, and her legs raised; and a servant should hold her from two sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body is not drawn out during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the os uteri with moist oils with marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed mucilage. Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her introduce it into the womb with ease.
Then let her seek with it the place in which to fix hooks from the fetus, and suitable places for that.
Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend on its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is on its feet, then in its pubis and middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand: and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have said, until she reaches the empty thing.
Then let it be extended with an equal extension, and let the extension not be according to straightness only, but rather let it be moved to every part, so that its exit is eased: just as is done with a tooth at its extraction.
And it is necessary that that which is between them be softened for the extension.
But if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so that she may revolve with them that which is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then let the hooks be changed to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
If therefore a hand comes out before other things, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then pull it out until, when it comes out completely, you incise it either at the joint of the sole, or at the elbow; and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or constriction happens to it in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary that he introduce between the fingers a spiny spatula, and split the head with it, and extract the water; or break it with the instrument which is called Almisdac, the form of which comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similarly, if the fetus is of the nature of a large head, then it is necessary that you cut with algengematu; or pull it out with misdach, as we have said.
Then pull out the bones with forceps.
But if the head comes out and is constricted at the clavicle, then let it be split until the moisture which is in the chest is poured out.
But if it is not folded, nor does it obey for exit, then cut the head piecemeal, according to what is possible for you.
But if there is an abscess in the lower part of the belly, or if there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary that you perforate it until the moisture runs out of it.
If however the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
But if it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with the cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and split the belly or chest until that which is in them runs out.
But if the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand. Therefore if the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand into the depth of the womb, and with it seek the head, and draw it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb; then let her insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it with them.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot abscess which happens to it, then it is not necessary that labor should be performed on it, rather then it is necessary to administer the pouring of moist, oily things; and administer plasters; and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it may be straightened; then let that which we said concerning a living fetus be administered.
But if that is not possible, then let it be cut piecemeal, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave nothing at all of the afterbirth inside.
Therefore when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning hot abscesses which happen in the wombs.
But if a flow of blood occurs, then let her descend into astringent waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
And I indeed already saw a woman, in whose belly a fetus had died; then she was impregnated above it by another time, afterwards another fetus also died.
Therefore, after a long time an abscess happened to her in her navel, and it swelled until it opened; and it began to emit pus.
Therefore I was called to her treatment, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Therefore I placed on it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out of the place.
Then several days passed for her, and another bone came out.
Therefore I was amazed at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Therefore I examined the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and now she lived in this way for a long time, and a little pus is discharged from the place.
And I did not establish this extraneous matter here, except because in it is knowledge, and help for that which a skillful physician manages with his hand in treatment.
Concerning the forms of instruments necessary in the extraction of a fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the form of a constrictor, by which books are bound, which has two equally sized heads at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
However, this head ought to be more slender than the constrictor; and it ought to be made either of ebony or boxwood.
And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers; and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed in both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two heads.
The form of the head by which the matrix is opened.
Another form similar to that one, more slender, and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a palm: and the width of each is two digits.
Therefore, when you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her legs hanging down, open what is between her legs.
Then insert these two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the lower extremity of the instrument between her hips.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount you wish of the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
The shape of another kind of speculum than the ancients described, the shape of a pusher by which the fetus is pushed.
The shape of the Almisdac with which a small head is crushed. The shape of a hook having one point.
The shape of a hook having two points.
The shape of forceps which has saw teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
The shape of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
The shape of two broad spatulas also.
All these instruments are practiced, and the more their types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the more highly regarded among men, because of their quantity.
Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, but let them be prepared for you.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
Concerning the extraction of the afterbirth.
Chapter 78.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you ought to instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
If therefore it comes out by this, it is good.
If not: then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid; and put into it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamus, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and seseli, and cassia wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and put them over the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end into the mouth of the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.
For the afterbirth will come out easily.
But if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or mallow mucilage. Then let her insert it into the vulva, and search for the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she has found it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
But if it is attached deep in the womb, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and draw it out gradually according to the straightness, so that the womb does not fall with violent pulling: rather it is necessary that it be moved with ease to the right and left sides: then let the amount of traction be added.
For then it obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with medication from a pot with herbs.
But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself over it in repeated extraction.
Truly it is necessary that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, be tied to the woman's hip.
Then give her a clyster with tetrapharmacon ointment.
For it will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will come out.
However, when it putrefies, an evil odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak woman.
Therefore, suitable fumigations ought to be administered to it.
Some of the ancients, however, have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated in the retention of the secundines and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to an alembic, or of copper; and let the wide end be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be placed upon the coals: let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and repeat another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many boys are born, and their anuses are imperforate, which a subtle membrane has already closed.
Therefore it is necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger; and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula; and let her beware of the rectum, lest she touch it.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil upon it.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to defecate.
And now there has occurred an obstruction of the anus also from the healing of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore it is necessary that that consolidation be cut, then treated with what we have said of treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Chapter Eighty.
Fistulas which occur in the lower part, are a knotting, and a swelling which occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one part: and it is one fistula, or several.
When therefore that knotting becomes old, it is opened, and a watery white moisture, or thin pus, flows from it.
And sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And there are some of these fistulas which when they are in the space penetrate as far as the bladder, and as far as the urinary passage.
And some of them penetrate as far as the hip joint, and as far as the coccyx.
Now, what distinguishes a fistula penetrating to the anus from one that is not, is that you insert your index finger into the anus: and insert a slender probe into the fistula made of air, or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a slender lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
But if you do not feel it completely, nor does anything proceed from the opening from excretion, nor flatulence, nor a worm as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to the cure.
And when a fistula penetrates to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus: then its indication is the exit of urine from it, and the prevention of its consolidation in this place with medicines.
If, however, it penetrates to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no tortuosity in it to the bone: and the finding of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always exits from it: and that medication is not effective in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is absolutely no cure: and their cure is labor and vanity for the foolish physician upon whom it is performed. In that which is not penetrating, and not old, healing is hoped for with a saw: according to what I relate to you, and I have already proven: and it is, that the infirm person lies between your hands on his back: and you raise his legs above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe arrives.
But if the infirm person feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you introduce your index finger into the anus.
Therefore if you feel the probe has already penetrated by itself, detected by your finger, besides what you feel between your finger and the fistula itself, or flesh: then therefore you know certainly that it is penetrating: therefore do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
However, they have said that in some men the flesh is healed, and of the medication by which help is hoped for it, it is, that you apply a fine cautery according to the size of the fistula, as preceded, and you introduce it burning into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat it twice, or three times, until you know that all those added filtered fleshes, which are similar to a bird's quill, have been burned.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, until those burned fleshes come out: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it is never healed with another treatment.
And if a probe emerges, and does not reach your finger, which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh or fat, and you see a fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe which is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered pieces of flesh, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing of them remains.
But if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you cut those pieces of flesh, then it is better, and of speedier help, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Because cauterization with fire brings together good conditions, the burning of those added pieces of flesh, and the staunching of blood, and the drying of humors.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, or with crushed cabbage leaves, until the place discharges pus, and those burned pieces of flesh come out in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which generate hard flesh: and these are medicines in which there is astringency and drying.
For when they are restored, then it is healed: and you do not fear a recurrence. But if the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from the superfluity of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a probe, and between you and it is a membrane of fat or flesh, and it is near penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
That is, because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize it, as we said: or to cut it, until you obtain its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert lint, and treatment from nearby.
And do not proceed far with the incision, lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and it happens to the patient that there is an involuntary discharge of excrement. Then treat it with what we have said. Perhaps indeed it will heal: or you will lengthen that membrane, and cleanse it after you cut it almost to the anus, as we said, either with a probe, or with another instrument of a sharp end.
Then cleanse those filtered  fleshes which are in the incision, as far as you can with exploration.
Then attempt the restoration of the whole wound with suture, and the upper opening where it consolidates: and a fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes a fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take a probe of a perforated end, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, of those preparing leather, according to this form.
And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and around it.
Then insert the probe with thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
If therefore it penetrates into the margin of the anus internally nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together: and tighten each, and leave it for one day, or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those flesh parts which are between the two ends of the thread are cut, and fall away: then treat the wound, until it consolidates, and heals.
For it is not in your power to do that because of the muscle, so that you do not cut it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
The shape of a spatulite probe with which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Concerning the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter LXXXI.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
For they are either within the anus, similar to bladders of coals, or plums; or as if they were themselves grape seeds.
And of these there are small ones and large ones: and blood always flows from them, and there is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus are, for the most part, of little moisture, from which flows a yellowish water, or a little blood with a constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is that you order the patient to strain; and it is pressed out until it emerges from the anus, and the athelil appear to you.
Therefore, also suspend it with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks do not hold them, because of their moisture and softening, then take them with a rough cloth, or with a pledget of wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Then incise them, and sprinkle on them after incision some warm powders, that they may stand in place of a cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
But if the anus does not obey evacuation, then give the patient an enema in which there is a little bite, so that what is in the anus may be washed out with it, and obey evacuation quickly, when the patient strains himself.
But if the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is that you take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and incise them.
Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever shrinks from incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method.
Take a rolled thread, and insert it into a needle.
Then draw the hemorrhoid upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be lateral: and bind the hemorrhoid with a strong constriction.
Then knot the thread, and withdraw the needle.
Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: nor compress it, so that a superfluity of blood may flow from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth infused in rose oil, or cerate, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Then leave it until it falls off.
When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of fissures.
For they often happen from the dryness of the stool and the constriction of nature.
When therefore they become chronic and medicine is of no use in them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula, or with your nail, until they become moist, and the upper layer which prevents them from healing is removed from them.
Then treat them until they heal as is necessary.
But if they do not heal, then repeat the scraping with greater force than the first time, until they bleed much and are excoriated; then treat them until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted haemorrhoids, and dry fissures, and fistulas.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, however, there is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence on the surface of the body.
And they often occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is that you extend the athelil and incise it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously stated with fire, or with a sharp medicine: and now inverted athelil, and non-inverted, are eradicated with the instrument which I shall describe. An ant, however, is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when cold finds it, something similar to the bite of an ant is felt in it, and it occurs throughout the body: and it occurs most often in the hands.
And its treatment is that you take a small tube from a goose quill, or a strong vulture quill: and place that tube over the ant, until the circle of the tube contains parts of it.
Then roll your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the ant: and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root. And if you wish, do that with a bronze or iron tube, according to this method.
Let the top of the tube be of a height that draws a rolled-up deafness, so that its grip on the finger and its rolling are eased.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was mentioned previously in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the forms of instruments which are used for clysters in illnesses of the anus, and for the loosening of the bowels, and for colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast bronze, or of hammered bronze.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and large, according to those in whom they are administered.
Therefore that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small: and whose anuses are weak, or painful, so also their clysters.
A large clyster.
A small clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper end to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner: and let it have a distinction so that the bag may be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, very smooth, tapering to a point: and on one of its sides let there be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker, and let the bag in which the medicines are placed be of an animal's bladder: or of sheepskin, which should be in the form of a small asofrat; whose root is one palm.
When therefore the bag is placed in it, let it be tied at the head of the clyster between two distinctions with a strong constriction.
Then clysterize with it.
And this is the form of the circle of the bags here depicted, and of the holes. Moreover, the quality of clysterizing with it is: that you fill the bag or bladder with medicine, which is heated according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and beware lest it be very hot, or very cold.
Then let the patient be laid on his back, and let him raise his legs upwards; and place under him an inthaan, that is, a hide upon which men lie, or a cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar things.
Then introduce it into the anus easily.
Then let the attendant take the bag with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully until he evacuates all that is in the clyster into the intestine. Then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs against the wall. But if the medicine causes him to evacuate, then let him retain it as much as he can.
And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more effective in helping.
But if you give him a clyster for ailments of looseness of the bowels, and its evacuation is rapid, then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
But if there are haemorrhoids in the anus, or harmful abscesses, then let the clyster be very fine, gentle, of the kind used for clystering children.
And this is the form of a fine clyster over which the skin is tight.
Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken in the division concerning the treatment of wounds which was appropriate to the book, and I shall here describe their treatment by hand and with medicines according to what is fitting.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore the things by which wounds are made are many times such as the throw of a stone: or the incision of a sword, or a knife: or a blow with a lance, or a stick, or an arrow: and similar things from many objects.
Moreover, wounds which are made according to the places of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or neck, or breast, or belly, or liver: and similar members.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may place that reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds: because the recollection of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound happens in the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and it has now broken only the skin: and it is a large wound, and you fear concerning the unfortunate outcome of a hot abscess: then hasten, and immediately phlebotomize the cephalic vein: and do not delay it: and draw from him blood according to the amount of his strength: if nothing prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood which exits from the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and coarse foods.
But if something prohibits bloodletting, then let him reduce [his intake] from food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess happens to it, a cloth infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
But if you are secure from a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I shall relate shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place on it certain ointments, until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from the incision of a sword, and similar things: and its lips do not come together by powders, then bring them together with suture, according to what I shall relate in wounds of the belly concerning their suture.
But if the wound is already detached from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspensory: then incise it.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient that he be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge: and things similar to them.
But if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then incise all the putrefied part, and throw it away: then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
Therefore if you find it uncut, then cut it with a Spatula, or tie it.
But if necessity demands when that which we have said does not help, then cauterize it, until the bleeding stops.
Method of incarnative powder.
Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: let the whole be ground very finely, and sifted: and let the wound be filled with it, and bound tightly, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it above with powders, and leave it, and do not unbind it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment and that of a head wound when it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to be done except to avoid treating it with something that produces strong stypticity, such as ziniar and zegi, and things like them.
Because they harm nerves and contract them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most superior of the members; and let that which heals it be from mild medicines, such as lime washed with fresh water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with fresh water; and the other mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer a suture; or draw together its lips with powders.
Then take care of it until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus is already collecting, then perforate it in the most depressed place in it.
But if an artery has been cut in the wound, and a flow of its blood has resulted, then separate or cut it and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the throat, or the whole thing, have been cut, and the al-haudegi have been saved, then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture over the tube of the throat, and do not touch the throat, but level it and restore it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments which have astringent and drying properties, until it is healed.
But if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then examine it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and what is not ready, leave it, until the wound putrefies, and its discharge is separated and lessened.
But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder which I have described.
But if bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that whose mention came in its chapter.
Chapter LXXXVI.
Therefore if air escapes from the wound when the sick person breathes, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its blood, then do not at first put powder in it, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment and dissolve it twice a day.
However, if you do not have ointment, then place old linen in the opening of the wound, so that it may absorb what comes out of it in terms of moisture; and cause the sick person to sleep on the wound, so that what collects in it may flow out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wounding, and the patient has not experienced a spasm, nor a bad trembling of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see his other conditions to be good, then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore treat it with linen bandages and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it always opens up, then know that a fistula has now formed.
Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what preceded concerning suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has made an impression on the bone, and fragments have fallen from it: then probe the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
However, if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction is then easier.
The judgment in the treatment of other wounds occurring in the other members is the same as that which we have spoken of.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestine, and their treatment.
Chapter LXXXVII.
The rupture which happens to the abdomen is great, moderate, and small.
Therefore, from a large one sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, protrude.
Therefore their replacement and suture is more forceful and difficult.
And a small rupture is also made difficult in another way.
It follows therefore that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten in their replacement to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and thickened: wherefore its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore, a medial rupture is better: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two types.
Know that the suture of the vein is according to four methods.
Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen, and for the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures are proper to other wounds.
However, they are more proper to the suture of the abdomen: and I will tell you each one with explanation and clarification. I say therefore, that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out of it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then it is because of one of two methods.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the coldness of the air.
When therefore it is so, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone.
Or boil it in water with squills, and cyperus, and spica, and bathe the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does this: and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow, or marshmallow has been boiled.
For by it its entry is eased with a small thing.
But if its return is impeded after this treatment, then incise a little in the rupture, with the instrument with which haemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than incision: and constraint to incise is not done after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the subtle extremity not be with the subtlety of a spatula, but rather be somewhat blunter: and it is that which is similar to a cautery, as you see.
Therefore when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own proper place, if it is possible above it: because it is better.
When however the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
And so it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In small wounds however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then make so that there is present between your hands a pious minister, who holds the whole rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Then uncover from it to him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the manner of the common suture of one.
And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the size of the wound.
Then leave from the extremity of the rupture the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle besides which you insert thread in the two extremities of the skin, with the two extremities of the sifac which is under the skin from the insides, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the sifac: and four rows are made.
Then tighten with double thread around the needle several times from the two parts together, until the two lips of the wound are brought together with a decent joining.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix in them another needle: afterwards tighten it with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with as many needles as you need, until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: because thin needles cut the flesh very quickly; and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in two extremities of the skin that are very close: lest the flesh be quickly cut, and the wound be opened before its consolidation, and they are not lengthened with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from consolidation.
Then cut off the ends of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient in his sleep: and put on them little cushions of cloth on every side, which hold the ends of the needles: and leave them, until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And indeed this kind of suture with needles is more suitable in small wounds.
Because one needle, or two, or about that many, suffice in their suture.
The second suture however is common, so that you join together with the suture four extremities: two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fascia in one place, with a needle in which is wound a thread equal in fineness and thickness.
Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, return the needle from the part from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is, like the seam of cloth by which cloths are sewn together, and place between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture men know.
And with this suture I sewed a wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than one palm: and there protruded from the intestines about two palms of the middle intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I replaced it after its intestine had stood outside the wound twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in the space of about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived after that many years, living according to his own nature.
And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any medicines, were to be found.
Therefore I placed old linen on the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper to the subject.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
Therefore when the needle penetrates the skin, and the muscle running according to the length and breadth of the whole body: leave the end of the sifac on the side into which you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside at the other end of the mirach.
When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this way at the same end of the mirach from the outside to the inside: and leave the end of the sifac, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration by which you make it penetrate in the sifac at the end of the mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates the whole thing.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end which is from the sifac on the other side, and draw the needle out of the skin which it penetrated.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the end of the sifac, which is on the other side, with this end of the mirach: and draw it out of the skin which is on its side, and do that once, and again: and do it turn after turn, until you sew the outside completely according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that you sew the suture of the leatherworkers as they sew leathers: so that you sew the sifac once from one side with one end of the skin: and that you leave it another time from another side, until you complete it.
The second kind of proper suture, which Galen mentioned.
His speech is reported, that you sew it according to the likeness in which certain mediciners sew them, so that they bring together each part to its corresponding part agreeing by nature: and apply the end of the sifac to its other end, and the end of the mirach to its other end.
And that is done as I tell you.
It is necessary that you fix the needle in the end of the mirach near you from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that alone: and leave the two ends of the sifac.
Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two ends of the sifac, namely on both sides.
Then turn both, also make them penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other ends of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture whose mention preceded.
This is therefore also the word of Galen.
And some said.
The suture of the abdomen is straightened with two needles.
That is, you insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew hides equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than that of the other parts of the abdomen.
The judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
That is, because when you obtain a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and its own, and fit it: then put on incarnative powder.
But if the air has already altered the wound, then put on it certain ointments which are present to you, until they produce pus; and the threads fall out, and the sifac and mirach consolidate.
Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
But if medicines are not present to you, then immediately put on it, from when it begins to emit pus, old lint; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
But if you fear that the wound will communicate with the principal members in injury, then it is necessary that you submerge soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil; and put it in the area around the groins and under the armpits.
But if it feels pain, or prickling, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens), then administer an enema with warm, black, astringent wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and has become an exit penetrating to its concavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and that which is from the small intestine, of more difficult healing.
Moreover, the intestine which is called the jejunum, does not receive healing from a wound which happens to it at all: and that is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is an intestine, and you obtain it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed, and it has become green or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place which is blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not happen.
For in an intestine there are veins and arteries.
Then incise that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the traction of it, and the extraction of it in the case of the intestine, and the emission of the pus of the wound, may be relieved for you.
Concerning a wound which happens in the intestine.
When a rupture happens in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it is restored in some men: therefore, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a blow of a lance, and the wound was from the right of the stomach, and the wound was old: and a fistula was made, and an evacuation and flatulence came out of it.
Therefore I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until it was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the patient, that some bad accident might happen to the patient in his belly: and no bad accident happened to him from that.
And he remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and he entered the bath, and he exercised in his diets.
And now some experienced men have said that when a wound happens in the intestine, and it is small: then it is necessary that it is tied according to this method.
And it is, that you take ants with large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of those ants which have an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it seizes upon it, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere, and not become loose.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease doing that with ant after ant according to the quantity of the whole wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm at all happens to the patient. And now it is possible that the intestine may also be tied with a fine thread: which has been cleaned from an animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is so that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is much thinned.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end.
Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then return it into the rupture. And this method of suture with ants and intestine, is only according to a way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy except reduction, nor is its healing at all complete.
Concerning the treatment of Zuchamen and fistulas.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that every wound or abscess when it grows old and becomes ancient, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and is not excised: then it is universally called, in whichever member it may be, a fistula, and we call it Zuchamen.
And a fistula indeed is, according to the truth, a filtered, hard, white knot; with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather: and on account of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And it is in some hours moist, which discharges pus.
And perhaps the moisture is split in some hours.
And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little; and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I already premised in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which is not healed, nor does flesh grow in it, is not that except because of one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of its bad quality: or because between it, and upon its lips is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because there is much dirt and filth: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is discharged from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment: or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or through a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the healing of abscesses is delayed in it by nature: or because in it is one bone, or a number of bones.
And I already showed all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Know therefore, that fistula happens in all the members of the body.
For among them are fistulas which reach to the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sifac: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the compound joints in their composition: such as the hand, and the foot: and among them are those which go to the proximity of a principal member, and similar things.
Therefore, whichever of these fistulas is according to this manner, is of the illnesses difficult of healing, and does not receive a cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
But if there is some fistula whose depth does not reach these places which I mentioned: and you hope, and are confident in its cure, and wish to arrive at the knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
But if there is tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of thin lead.
Because lead, with the softness of its body, is alleviated, and is bent around the tortuosity.
But if the fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for you to probe it with a probe.
Therefore, inject a clyster into one of its orifices.
For the moisture with which you inject a clyster goes towards the other orifices, and flows out of them.
Then diligently inquire in whatever way is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the cavity of the fistula is distant or near; or whether it is one fistula which has many orifices, and attend to all that with the greatest strength of yours: with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and with the discovery of pain upon compression with your hand on the place, and with similar signs and causes happening to the abscess.
When therefore you have attended to all those things truly, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider then if the fistula is near, apparent, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then cut the fistula as has been premised in my account, and remove what is in it of pus, and corrupt flesh, which grows in its orifice from flesh or thelul, and the like; and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you cut it deeply as much as is possible for you.
Then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then apply linen cloths wrapped in sharp medicines: and introduce them up to the cavity of the fistula which you have reached with the iron: do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed for you: then investigate it, and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
If therefore bone is discovered, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which causes it to grow flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed, and it emits pus as it did before: then know that you have not arrived at the complete eradication of the corruption.
Then investigate it again, and meticulously perform its scraping, and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it heals, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
But if a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for it.
But if there are many bones, then skillfully perform the extraction of them all, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
But if something of the humors opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in incising them, then incise those humors and the flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then apply something to the wound that will cause it to putrefy: and leave it until that which is around those bones of flesh and humors has putrefied.
And keep the wound so that it does not heal.
And let the incision which you made in your operation be constricted.
Rather, if you are afraid, place upon it a lint that has been soaked in crushed sulfur with oil: or lint soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those humors putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction will be easier.
But if there is one large bone, such as a bone of the leg, or a hip bone, and similar to those, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the last method until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Then restore the wound.
But if that which is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it entirely to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated. And I tell you, a thing which happened to a man in his leg: that you may put it as an example and help for your operation.
There was a man, young in age, about thirty years old, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause which moved upon him within the body, that is, from the interior parts, until the materials reached the leg, and it became an abscess with a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Therefore a time was spent with him in error by the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many materials flowed from it.
And the treatment of it was delayed, until the leg became fistulated, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and the humours of the body.
Therefore many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of surgery among them, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials which ran from those openings in great quantity: indeed the whole body of the man was now wasted, and his colour was yellow.
Therefore I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to communicate with each other from all parts of the leg. I therefore prepared, and cut above one of those openings, until I uncovered part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was now eroded, and blackened, and putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore I sawed what was revealed to me, and prepared [it] from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was in the bone only that corruption, which I cut away and sawed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and healed: and this iteration in its operation, and section of it, was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and the smallness of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death: because there happened to him at all hours from the superfluity of evacuation bad fainting spells.
Therefore he healed with a complete healing: and there grew in the place of the bone hard flesh, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he behaved in his dispositions: and it did him no harm at all in walking.
But if a protruding bone in the body is already broken: then it is necessary that you bind it, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligament, and bind it to the extremity of the protruding bone: and order someone to pull it upwards: and put another thicker ligament of wool on the first ligament. Then bind it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood, or a board, under the bone below decently: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting corrupt flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupt place a little, so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels another sawing in its place. But if the bone is corrupt, and is not protruding, but rather a part of it is continuous with a part: and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all parts entirely.
Then place wood underneath.
Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other part: and let the sawing be according to the length from the corruption a little, according to what we have said.
But if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupt joint itself, and saw the bone where it is continuous on the other side.
If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
But if the corruption is in the back of the hand, or in the back of the foot: then the matter is very difficult in it.
Truly it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and clean it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever instrument is rectified for you: when it does not oppose you, vein, or nerve.
And know that cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety, and their magnitude, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument suitable to that operation.
And know that these operations signify to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long study.
And the knowledge of the methods of this art, a witness to the methods of illnesses: then indeed you will find by yourself that which is suitable to it from the instruments for every infirmity.
The shape of a saw.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of another saw.
This depicted saw shape, let it be properly made. Let its upper arc be made of iron sharpness, and its handle of boxwood, and let it be pyramidally and properly made.
The shape of a joint rasp.
Let the head of this rasp be according to the form of the head of a star nail; and let its points be according to the form of the points of an  elschetfegi.
And it is not suitable except that the heads of joints are rubbed with it when they are corrupted, or a bone is large and great.
The form of a larger rasp.
The form of a medium rasp.
The form of a broad rasp.
The form of a rasp in which there is a concavity.
The form of another, fine rasp.
The form of another rasp with a curved end.
The form of a small, thin, slender rasp.
The form of a rasp with which bones are incised.
Also the form of a large rasp.
This is similar to a saw, and the end is like a saw; it is shown in many places for the reason of bones.
The form of a rasp which is suitable for rasping that which has been perforated from bones.
Its end is triangular, of sharp points.
It is made of Indian wood.
And similarly it is necessary that all those things which we have spoken of be made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
Extremities putrefy, either from an external or an internal cause.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the cure does not help, and you see the corruption cutting into the member, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you incise that member as far as the corruption extends, so that the sick person may escape death, or a worse evil which is greater than the loss of the member.
And the sign that this happens is that the member blackens until it seems that fire has burned it, or it putrefies after the blackness, until that putrefaction is incised to where it follows that member, and creeps into the whole body.
Therefore hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the striking of certain poisonous things: such as a sea scorpion, and a viper, and a whelk, and similar things.
Therefore if the corruption or blow is in the extremity of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, so that it may proceed to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then incise it from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold in the forearm.
And if it invades it, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint. But if the corruption passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the sick person.
And to administer beyond that in treatment, is a matter of skill.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then incise it at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the instep, then incise the whole foot.
But if it ascends to the knee, then incise the leg at the knee joint.
But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except giving up, and leaving the sick person to death.
And the method of incising a limb, or sawing it, is to constrict the ligament below that which you wish to incise; and constrict another ligament above the place.
And let an assistant extend one ligament downwards; and let another assistant extend the other ligament upwards.
And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then let it be incised, or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw not touch the healthy place; and there will happen to the sick man an added injury, and a hot abscess.
But if internal bleeding occurs while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly; or place upon it some powders that stanch blood.
Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded member with a bandage suitable to it, and care for it until it is healed.
And I tell you that which happened to a man in his foot, the same accident that I relate to you.
Which is, because there happened in his foot a blackness, with a burning which is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption at first happened in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Therefore the man hastened of himself, after he saw the corruption increasing in the member with its vehemence, that which he found from its pain, and burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and was healed.
And after a long time had passed for him, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I put on his hand from medicines after cleansing his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to proceed into another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore he called me, to cut off his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from myself concerning the repulsion of that excess: and I also feared for him concerning the cutting off of his hand death.
Because the man's strength was beyond the case.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and it came to me concerning him, that he hastened, and cut off his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought this narrative, except that it may be a help concerning that which falls under the kind of this illness: and that it may be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be treated.
Concerning the care of sinuses, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it breaks or is perforated, and that which is in it of pus goes out, and a hollow place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has been thinned: and it does not reach the ultimate in its corruption, nor does it affect bone, nor nerve, nor ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption affects any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
And its cure is, that you incise that whole skin as it is rolled up: and especially when it has been thinned, and made like cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin adheres, and that ultimate corruption does not follow from it: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster: and it is, that you should consider the Sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus which is emitted from it is foul-smelling: then clysterize it with the Egyptian medicine, which is of vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, they are mixed in a vessel: and they are boiled over a fire, until the medicine reddens: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take of it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the Sinus with it: and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Then draw it out by expression: do this for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with wood ash water, when you do not have this medicine present: and it is, that you take the ash of vine wood, or ash from holm oak wood: and pour water over it.
Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed.
But if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the wood ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which something of crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Or clysterize him with mixed honey and wine, because it is of the property of honey to cleanse and wash; and wine causes adhesion to the sinus, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has now been removed: then clysterize him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
And it is, that you take of diafinicon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or clysterize him with certain other medicines and ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
But if the orifice of the sinus is constricted, so that the clyster cannula does not enter: then enlarge it slightly with iron; or place in it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring its lips together with a suture: and leave of it an amount into which a clyster may enter without addition.
And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated to the upper parts: then cut it in a lower place which is in it, so that the pus may run from it downwards: because pus, when constricted in the depth of the sinus, prevents flesh from being generated in it.
But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation by which pus may run from it easily as it is prepared for you.
Try that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidating medicines which are placed on the sign, suitable for that which you wish.
And spread them on a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a quantity that the whole sinus may be communicated.
Then cut with scissors in a straight line with the opening of the sinus a hole, a little larger than the opening of the sinus.
Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it at a distance from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be relieved: and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days at one time.
But the one which is over the opening of the sinus, is the one which you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may come out: and so that you may know whether what flows from it is much or little virus, or digested or undigested.
And with this again consider the place of the sinus itself, whether its lord feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is no abscess in it.
When therefore your medication is extended in this way, and you see the matter which comes out over the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus now adheres, or is approaching adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment. But if a subtle virus comes out of the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and of them there are those who act contrary to that.
But if undigested pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed, and its matter is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, what physicians do, so that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their virtue: such as diafinicon ointment, when an excess of addition from zegi is added to it.
And of the last things by which it is cured, is that you take diafinicon ointment, and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it old wine equal in its substance.
Then mix it with it, and use it.
And it does something similar to this, when you do not have diafinicon ointment at hand, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and you use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Then spread over it a cloth, and bind it over the sinus: and spread with the honey which you boiled, until it thickened: and powder over it spices, and place over it a cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes there is administered in it long birthwort, and roots of the lily of the sky, and there is lily: and herb flour, and centaury.
Use them simple, or compounded, grind them, and sift them: and powder over the honey which I have told of, and use it.
But if the matter of the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment: then know that in its depth is corruption: or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what has been premised. Concerning the treatment of whitlow and a rubbed nail, and the incision of an added finger, and section.
Chapter XCI.
Whitlow is an abscess which arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it arises in the other fingers.
Therefore, when its matter is prolonged, and its cure is neglected, and it becomes inflamed with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
When therefore you treat it, with what we said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you incise with an iron all the excess which remains of the nail.
Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
For cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail already compress the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin probe under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards: and incise that flesh easily, and place on what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until the whole of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption already penetrates into the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone, and extract it: for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
But if you see corrosion and corruption advancing in the finger, then incise it at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if there should happen to be an abrasion or a blow to the nail, and intense pain occurs, then it is necessary that you first bleed the patient.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula with a transverse cut from above downwards.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause very intense pain to the patient, and it will be the cause of the growth of added flesh in the place.
Then treat the place with that which soothes pains.
Moreover, the added finger which is born on the hands of some men, perhaps is wholly fleshy; and perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them are born at the root of a joint, or its origin is in certain knots of a finger.
Therefore, that which is born in certain knots of a finger, is not moved; and that which is born at the joint of a finger, perhaps is moved.
Therefore, the cutting of that one which is fleshy among them is easy.
That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
But the treatment of that whose origin is at the root of a joint is difficult.
Therefore abstain from its incision.
However, in that which is born in a finger at the last knuckle, then it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a round incision down to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Now, the consolidation which happens to fingers together, very often happens either from a person's birth, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore it is necessary that you separate that consolidation, until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between them linen cloths, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them; or place between them a thin lead plate, until the place consolidates as it ought.
And similarly if consolidation happens to some fingers with the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the member.
Concerning the incision of a vitiated part.
Chapter 92.
Varices are convoluted veins, thick, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many members of the body; and their occurrence is most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and labor, and carry burdens.
Therefore it is necessary that you administer a shaking of the body from black bile, sometimes with a strong shaking.
Then, bleed the patient in the basilic vein.
The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out.
And the other method is that the vein is raised, and the whole thing is drawn out.
Its incision is according to this method.
First bathe the leg with much warm water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of his hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the vein downwards until a quantity of blood comes out which you see is sufficient, and which the patient's strength can bear.
Afterwards bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods which produce black bile; and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
Its elevation is in this manner.
Shave the patient's leg if there is much hair on it.
Then put him in a bath; or rub his leg with warm water until it reddens and the veins swell; or let him take vigorous exercise, if a bath is not available, until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the skin lengthwise directly over the vein; either at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein bare on all sides until it appears clearly: and at its appearance, you will see it red, tending towards blackness.
When it is freed from the skin, you will see it white, like a cord.
Then insert a spatula under it until it is raised and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Then make another incision about three fingers' breadth from that incision.
Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Then raise it with spatulas as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need it.
Then raise it, and incise it with the last incision near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision which is above it.
And do this until you pull it out from the incision which is higher, or higher than all the incisions, until when it comes out entirely: then incise it.
But if it does not obey you to be pulled out and raised: then insert a needle with strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert a probe under it: and turn your hand to every part, until it comes out.
And beware that it is not incised.
For if it is incised, it becomes very difficult for you to raise it, and harm enters the patient from it.
Therefore, when you have pulled it out entirely: then place on the place of the wounds wool submerged in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it, until it is healed.
But if the piece of vine is contracted, having a tortuosity to which there is a winding to the parts, and is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you split it at every part of its tortuosity, and the places of its winding.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you raise it entirely: and beware in your incision upon it lest you cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to raise, or extract it.
Therefore preserve your prudence.
The form of the incision by which the piece of vine is healed.
The form of a blind hook.
It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor is it sharply pointed, so that it does not wound a vein: and it is of thick, gentle curvature: because if it were thin, it would cut a vein by its thinness: indeed, let it have superfluous thickness, as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg. Chapter XCIII.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Algezira, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little softness, that is, in which grass or trees do not grow.
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction which happens under the skin, just as serpents and ascarid worms, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh, happen within bodies.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a strong inflammation happens in the leg.
Then the place blisters.
Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that blister, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight is from one keil drachm to two drachms, and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
As often therefore as something comes out of it to the exterior, wrap that in lead and tie it.
If it is prolonged much, then cut part of it, and wrap up the remainder.
And do not cut it at the root before it comes out completely.
Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh: and it causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be treated gently, and drawn out little by little, until it comes out to its end, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein indeed there comes out in some men that which is in its length five palms and ten.
And now it has come to me, that it came out from a man of twenty palms.
But if it is cut into during your treatment, then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long opening, along with the body, until all that is in it of matter is evacuated: and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Therefore treat it, as we said in the division, and with that which was premised.
Concerning the incision upon worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine sickness.
Chapter 94.
This sickness is called in a certain land among us bovine sickness, because,  because it very often happens to cattle, and it is a small single worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it goes throughout the whole body, ascending and descending; and its movement from member to member is shown to the sense, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Just as worms and snakes occur, that is, earthworms and ascarids, in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malignancy.
Because when it goes in the body and rises to the head and arrives at a place, then perhaps it opens there and emerges and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, then this is not done except at the time of its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore it is necessary that you bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Then cut over it and extract it.
But if it penetrates deep into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies.
And what is more feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said. But if you see it has already arrived at the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Then cut over it and extract it.
And it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the illness Nakir.
Chapter 95.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain which happens in certain members: then it is changed from member to member.
And I indeed already saw it, according to what I relate to you.
I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling proceeding with speed, as a worm proceeds, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be: so that it is like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Therefore the pain departed from that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it arrived in the other arm.
Then she related to me that it was revolving in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Therefore I was astonished at the speed of its change from member to member.
And indeed I had not seen this illness before with my own eyes in this manner.
However, I saw many who found pain shifting from member to member: and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is, except that it is because the woman was of those who are of the villages of dry bodies with exposed veins: hence therefore that shifting windiness appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, and hidden veins.
When therefore you wish its cure, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to you by sight, as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and cut above it until that constricted windiness comes out: and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels windiness, and removes it with foul-smelling pills, and pills of serapinum, and the like.
Concerning the extraction of arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows are diversified according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they fall in the body.
Their diversity is this: for some of them have large and small points; and some are concave and some blunt.
And some of them have three points.
And some of them have barbs.
And some of them have small points.
Those, however, which are according to the members in which they fall, are of two kinds.
For either the members are of the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and the like.
Therefore when it falls into any of these members, and the signs of death, which I shall tell you later, appear to you, then you ought to avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in most instances.
And when those bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and exits the dura mater which is above the brain, are: that there happen from it intense thirst, and dimness of vision, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile.
And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And a white moisture similar to pus comes out from the place of the wound.
And something like the watery part of flesh comes out of it.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs, however, of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels with it as if it were fixed in something hard, not in something empty.
And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of the pulse: and black blood runs from the wound.
And coldness of the extremities follows, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Know therefore that death approaches without doubt.
And a sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck become suppurated, and the color of the sick man changes.
And he breathes out a large, deep breath: and he seeks the intake of cold air.
But if the arrow falls on the membrane which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and great shortness of breath occurs with intense pain, with sighing: and all the members of the shoulders are moved.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the belly, and is fixed in it: something of the excrement comes out of the wound, or pus, or intestine which has already been broken.
Therefore there is no hope in his cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
But if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the patient: then know that it is mortal.
The remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and armpit, and the vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to many dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve: and the arrow is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I have seen of the nature of these arrows, that you may signify by that concerning your cure.
That is, because an arrow fell upon a certain man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose.
Therefore I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell upon him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained from it only a small extremity, with which it adhered to its shaft: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with a soft iron head, in which there are no barbs.
Therefore the Jew was healed, and no evil accident happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one which has barbs.
Therefore I made an incision upon it between two guide-strings: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Therefore I carefully worked with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed for him, and nothing of his condition had changed, I made an incision over the arrow: and I worked on it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no ill effect happened to him.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound had healed over it.
After therefore seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman into whose abdomen an arrow had fallen, and the wound had healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and none of her condition changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound healed, and it remained, causing him not much pain: and many things similar to these.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had now deviated a little to the right side: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Therefore I was called to his treatment after the arrow's impact for three days.
Therefore I found the arrow wound very constricted.
Therefore I searched for it with a slender probe, and did not feel it: and he himself found a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
Therefore I hoped that that prick was from the point of the arrow.
Therefore I plastered the place with a plaster which had attractive and digestive power, trusting that the place would suppurate, and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut upon it: and there did not occur in the place an occurrence signifying that the arrow had reached the place.
Therefore I persevered with the plaster upon him for many days: and no occurrence happened, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained ill from the extraction of it for a space of days, until on a certain day he felt the arrow within his nose.
And he told me that.
Therefore I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it was opened: and when I probed it, I felt the thin point of the arrow which adhered to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound by that sharp medicine, until the point of the arrow appeared to us visibly: and about four months of time passed with me because of it.
Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield to exit: then I did not cease to refine, and devise concerning it with ingenious methods, until on a certain day I began upon it with decently made forceps, according to what their form will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirmity was healed with complete health: nor did anything at all harm him.
And I relate to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that as a rule and meaning upon that which I have not said.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration: nor does the book comprehend that, and the prudent craftsman compares with a little concerning much: and with that which is present, concerning that which is absent: and finds a new operation, and a new instrument in the descent of extraneous things of this art when they happen.
I say therefore, that arrows do not exit from the members to which they are fixed, except according to two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Or by the opposite of the other part.
And that which exits from where it entered, is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is drawn, and exits.
But if it does not obey exit at the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it some days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its traction is lessened, and its exit.
And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and does not obey you for exit, then leave it also some days: and repeat it with traction and movement every day, until it exits.
But if it does not obey you for exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself on every side with a thin drill, until the arrow is widened.
Then draw it, and extract it.
If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already proceeded into one ventricle of the brain, and some of those accidents which I have mentioned appear in the patient: then abstain from drawing the arrow, and leave it, until its being is equalized after days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate as far as the sifach: and the patient remains for some days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him: then be ingenious in drawing the arrow and extracting it.
But if it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you when you draw it: then apply a drill around the arrow, as I have related to you: then treat the place, until it is healed.
But if the arrow is now hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sensation: then search for it with a probe.
But if you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
But if you cannot reach it, because of the tightness of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep within, and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then incise over it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
But if it has barbs by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them on every side, by every means you can, and by devices, if you cannot overcome the adhesion of the flesh in the barbs' fracture, and their twisting, until it comes out.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you cause it to come out: and the finest points with the finest subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you, and its removal.
But if you cannot reach it within an hour, then leave it for a few days, until those things which are around it putrefy.
Then try again; for the swelling will be lessened. But if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we said concerning treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And administer every possible means of removing the arrow: and let that be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that, when you pull out the arrow, you make the patient lie in the same position as he was when the arrow struck him.
Because it is more helpful.
But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the positions.
But an arrow which emerges from the opposite side, or something of it already proceeds outwards: or the point of the arrow makes a swelling by sensation on the nearby upper part of the skin, and you see it prominent: therefore cut over it, and let the incision be of such a size that forceps can grasp it.
Then pull it out: for it will then be easy to remove.
But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow is embedded in the bone and widens itself; then pull it out.
And if not: leave it for a few days; then try again, until it comes out.
But if the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it with that.
But if the wood has fallen off, and you wish to administer a push: then introduce a concave instrument, so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow; then push it with that.
But if the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
For the arrow is lightened by that.
But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
But if the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near to what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then sew the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the shape of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to a bird's beak, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
And many kinds are made of them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the size of the wound, and its narrowness.
The shape of the concave pusher.
And the shape of the blunt pusher.
This is a blunt end like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased, and it is pushed with it.
The end of this concave pusher is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it and its pushing are eased.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
Chapter 97. The veins to be phlebotomized, whose custom has run in the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbae; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two lachrymal ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the tip of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, however, which are bled in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the outer side: and the common people call it the vein of the head.
And the dark one.
And there is the Median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic, and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the Basilic, and it is situated on the inner side: and it is also called Titillicaris.
And the common people call it the vein of the belly.
And the rope of the arm, and it is situated above the forearm: and it is that in which bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with clear application.
And the Salvatella: and it is a vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb from the outer side.
And the second is the Saphena: and its place is near the heel from the inner side.
And the vein Nesse: and its place is near the heel from the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomy of the two veins which are behind the ears, however, is a benefit for old catarrhs, and hemicrania, and sahafati, and old bad head ulcers.
And the quality of bleeding it is according to what I relate.
And it is so that the head of the sick person is shaved: and his occiput in the place of the two veins is rubbed with a rough cloth with a good rubbing.
Then let the sick person bind his neck with a band, until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head.
Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there mark with cautery.
Then take a lancet phlebotome, and it is that which is called Incidens.
Then insert it under the vein in the skin, until the phlebotome reaches the mouth.
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and incise the vein with the skin with an incisive incision.
And let the length of the incision be the size of two joined fingers, or thereabouts: and let out as much blood as you wish.
Then bind it with lint, and leave it until it heals.
And already the incision and cauterization of them preceded in the beginning of the book.
Concerning phlebotomy of two arteries in times.
Truly, the two arteries which are in the two times of phlebotomy are a help for old hemicrania, and bad toothache, and constant ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp effused superfluities to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I relate to you.
Let the sick person strongly constrict his neck until two veins appear manifestly to the sense of sight: and let their pulse be demonstrated under your finger.
Then mark them with a cautery.
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the cutting phlebotomist underneath, and lift the vein upwards.
And incise it, as you did in the other two veins: and make the blood flow according to the amount of your need. Then loosen the constriction of the sick person, and place your finger on the vein for one hour.
Afterwards place a compress and pledgets on it, and bind it tightly above with a strong bandage: and leave it until it heals.
And now the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction has preceded in the beginning of the book.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
The benefit, however, of phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead is, after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, for old facial ailments: and for hemicrania, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is, according to what I relate to you.
The infirm person constricts his neck with a fillet until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument which is called a Fossorium.
Whose form is this.
Place the prominent point which is on the head of the Fossorium upon the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with something else in its manner: and let the blood flow according to the quantity which you wish.
Then loosen the perforation of the infirm, and bind it until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a broad phlebotome.
However, it is not necessary that the phlebotome be of a sharp extremity, like the other phlebotomes, but rather of a broad extremity.
And phlebotomize it according to the transverse; because the bone is near; and perhaps in it the phlebotome will be broken when it is thin.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins in the two tear ducts.
Moreover, the help of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, is for the eye from scab and redness; and sebil in the eye, and sicknesses of the face.
And the manner of phlebotomizing them is that the infirm person should bind his neck with a fillet.
Then phlebotomize them; and you be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across, a little lengthwise, with a small, somewhat broad phlebotome, for there is no flesh in the place.
For if the phlebotome is of a slender point, perhaps it will break.
Then let blood flow as much as is necessary for you.
And place a pledget on them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose.
Phlebotomy of the veins of the nose, however, is beneficial for acute fever, and violent headache, and facial illnesses, such as hemicrania, and redness which occurs in the face: especially when it is longstanding.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should constrict his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long phlebotomy instrument; and insert it in the middle of his lip, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness.
Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you should move your hand with the phlebotomy instrument a little; and you should make the blood flow according to your need.
Then bind it with one knot.
For it is restored quickly.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the Guidegi.
Indeed, the phlebotomy of two Guidegi veins helps with shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, herpetic esthiomenes.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that the infirm one binds himself under both [veins] on his neck with a ligature; and the surgeon stands over the head of the infirm one, and the infirm one sits on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist opens the vein to a length somewhat ample for the phlebotomy.
Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for it.
Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction, so that the infirm one is not strangled.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound heals.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins, Algeberich.
Moreover, Algeberich's phlebotomy is helpful because it contributes to canker in the mouth and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers also which are in the nose and in its circumference.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that you make the infirm one sit before you and bind his neck with a band.
Then roll back his lip and look at the two veins: of which one is on the right of the lip and the second on the left of it; and the indication of both is by the blackness of both.
And this is true: because in their circumference are small, black veins.
Therefore incise each with an incisive incision. But if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then attend to the incision of the larger of them, and the more manifest of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed custom runs mostly with it: and incise the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
Truly, the help of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for obstructions which are in the throat, and sickness of the uvula, and sicknesses of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing them is that the infirm person should sit between your hands before the sun: and raise his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein: and the color of each inclines towards blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize both: and be careful lest you wound your hand in phlebotomizing them.
For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries will happen.
Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Now the three veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those in whose phlebotomy custom runs in all men.
And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or an olive-shaped one to a sloping thinness: or by cutting with a knife-like phlebotome, and that is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is that which is suitable for section.
And of them are broad species, and thin ones according to the width of the veins and their narrowness. The form of the myrtle phlebotome is broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of less width, and of a more slender point.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellow blood.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the basilica.
Now the basilica, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the belly: and it befits the phlebotomist, when he phlebotomizes it, that he be cautious, and be on guard against it, for under it is an artery.
Therefore if he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will result.
Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a pointed phlebotomy instrument; rather, let it be cut with an Alnesil.
But if the basilica does not appear in manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you abandon it, and change to another, or seek some branch of it: or phlebotomize in its place the vein of the arm.
For it is manifest, and cut it with the Alnesil phlebotomy instrument, as we said.
But if you wish the phlebotomy of the same [vein], then it is necessary before constriction of the arm, that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Then mark the place with a cautery, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with the Alnesil phlebotomy instrument, as we said.
And beware lest the incision fall through the space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with the cautery, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
But if you see the blood at the phlebotomy leaping up, like the urine of a boy, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Then therefore hasten, and put your finger on it for a long space, then remove your finger.
If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then bind the arm, and release it: and let the patient beware of its movement: and let him be in fear of it.
And let him not move it for some days, until it is healed.
But if the blood is not cut off, and it overcomes you: and you do not have medicine present at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of a pistachio, and split it; take one half, and bind it over the place of the constriction of the vein decently, with a bandage and pledgets until the next day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
And if not: then treat it with that whose mention preceded from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in most cases, because of the smallness of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the median basilic vein.
Moreover, the benefit of phlebotomy of the median basilic vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that he be careful about its phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
If therefore he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, numbness occurs in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed.
And this nerve often appears to the sense.
But if it is hidden in some men, and is thin, and is not shown: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy, by which you perform the phlebotomy, with an incision with an Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
But if the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the Cephalic vein.
Moreover, phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to the illnesses of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-shaped phlebotomy instrument, or with a myrtle-shaped phlebotomy instrument: because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor nerve. Nevertheless it is fitting for you in phlebotomy, that you avoid with the phlebotomy instrument only the head of the humerus, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first incision, that it is repeated upon it with the phlebotomy instrument several times. Nevertheless perhaps it becomes inflamed in some men when it is not phlebotomized in the first incision, but that inflammation does not harm it in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Moreover, the quality of phlebotomy, and its accidental occurrences, in whose rectification it is necessary for you to think.
First therefore of that it is necessary that you know, that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and its perseverance, and caution from the arrival of illnesses.
And that phlebotomy be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Median, and the Basilic.
And that phlebotomy be done at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer: and in autumn and winter after a meal, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomy however which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour: but when suitability and necessity provoke it, at night, or by day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And it is not fitting that boys be bled until fourteen years come upon them.
Nor let a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month to the seventh.
Nor let old men be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore when anyone wishes to be bled for whatever reason: it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if much retained stool is in them: lest the veins attract during phlebotomy from the bowels putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members.
Nor let a patient suffering nausea, that is, a sickening fullness, be bled; nor one suffering from a hangover, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Nor one ill with dropsy.
And let phlebotomy be avoided again after a colic attack, and vomiting, and diarrhoea, and excessive intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and everything that weakens the bodily or animal strength.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing forbids it: or let him engage in some exercise, so that the blood may be thinned.
And place his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said: and strive that his chest be evacuated on that day of all bad animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive intercourse, and the like.
And let him have present in his seat things with whose use the custom of men runs, from aromatics and fragrance, and dancing and similar things, in the quantity possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion which is higher than the cushion of the phlebotomized; afterwards let him pull out his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Then let him tighten the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal, or by excess in the constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood; or in softening, then also it prevents the flow of blood.
Then after the constriction it is necessary that the phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins swell and are apparent to the sense.
Then let the phlebotomist wipe the phlebotomized with a little old oil, properly.
Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself below the place where he wishes to phlebotomize, a little: so that the vein does not slip away, and the incision is missed.
Because among the veins there is one which you find like a fleeing cord during phlebotomy: and among them there is one which is full of wind: and when you place the phlebotomized over it, it contracts under the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is constricted: therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm, and be careful in all these things.
Then let him put down the phlebotomized.
And if not, then repeat it another time a little below that place, or above it quickly: if the place is not festering.
But if it festers, or the patient is frightened, then leave him for a day or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess.
Nor should he enter a bath.
Then let him repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly: and you fear that the quantity of blood you wish will not come out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole according to the straightness, and add a little to the operation.
And do this quickly, before the place becomes abscessed, for an abscessed place is difficult in many men with a small operation.
Therefore if you see it already abscessed, then do not repeat it at all, for it will excuse nothing for you. And put something of the dregs of oil on it: because it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomy, which phlebotomizes veins against the prohibition of blood flow: and they do this with theriac alfarach, and sagzenea, when one of them is placed upon the place.
For blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
But if a large abscess happens at the place of phlebotomy, for it happens very often, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except at that time, or the opening of the vein is small, then hasten and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little: and bind it for an hour: because it is dissolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
And very often indeed abscesses and swellings happen near the phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
Therefore put your hand upon it, then if you find softness in your compression upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Beware therefore, that you put upon it something of that which we have said.
For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man from the blood according to the quantity of his strength.
And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it reddens: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it out until it is thinned: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein phlebotomy be widened, and the phlebotomy be wide: and in him who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that he extract it in turns, and that the opening be narrow: and better that which is administered in vein phlebotomy is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of a nerve: and it is more laudable, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
And for whom it is accustomed to arrive at syncope during phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or sugarcane, if it is heated: and extract from his blood in three times, or four.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in quince syrup, or in syrup of honey spiced with spices, or in fragrant spiced syrup.
But if syncope happens during phlebotomy, and its cause is the exit of much blood: then it is necessary that he take in drink meat water, and a subtle fragrant syrup: and he use aromatherapy with agarwood, and let his chest be anointed with it: and let him use the other things which we said in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
But he who wishes to evacuate his arm, and to release his blood secondly: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he release blood gradually according to the quantity of strength in continuous days.
But he who wishes to evacuate his arm, and to release his blood secondly, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours, or nine, from his first phlebotomy.
But he who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite of the part to which it inclines: it is necessary that he be evacuated on the second day, or on the third.
But in whose body there is much blood already heated, and sharpened, and causes fever to happen: it is necessary that blood go out from it at one time, and a large quantity be drawn from it: and the opening be widened until syncope happens: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you put your hand upon his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not happen instead of syncope.
For often that happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence falls.
And it is not necessary, when you wish to release the arm, and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that it be pressed upon forcefully, and bent and extended quickly.
For that is very bad, indeed leave it until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument that which is coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and put upon it something of salt dissolved in water.
And place upon it something of theriac alfarob or sagapenum, and apply it with gentle compression, until the blood flows out.
But if the vein is already inflamed, then leave it, and do not cover it, until the inflammation subsides.
But if necessity requires bleeding a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another vein in the other arm.
The rope of the arm is phlebotomized in the place of the Median and Basilic veins, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should put his hand into warm water until it becomes easily reddened and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be tied above it with a ligature, with moderate constriction.
Then phlebotomize across it gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize it a little above the joint of the hand.
And indeed, the flow of blood is mostly put into warm water in the winter time.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy, however, of the Salvatella of the right hand, benefits liver diseases.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that you bind the Salvatella of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you put it into warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly shown.
Then phlebotomize it transversely.
And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
And take care not to cut your hand with the phlebotome.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers bared of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and will be prevented from flowing.
Therefore, when you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not quickly clot.
And similarly it is necessary that you do with every constricted branch.
The help, however, of its phlebotomy from the left hand, is: because it is contributing to the illnesses of the spleen: and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second equally.
The help of the saphenous phlebotomy, however, is for illnesses which are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menstrual blood, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is, that the infirm person puts his foot into warm water: and makes friction upon it, until the veins swell: and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap.
And indeed the place of the vein is near the heel, appearing towards the thumb: and many branches ramify from it in the surface of the foot.
Therefore bleed it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its confluence: because it is better and safer.
But if you bleed it in the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are under it on the surface of the foot.
And make your phlebotomy, by which you bleed it, transversely, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skillful.
But if the exit of blood is prevented, then bathe his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into it, until it is evacuated.
But if the phlebotomist misses the vein at the first attempt, then repeat with the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear any harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic veins, as we said, is near the heel on the outer side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for pain in the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the patient should enter the bath and hurry; and bind his leg from the side of the hip to above the heel with four fingers' breadth, with a long thin band; for it does not appear otherwise.
When therefore it appears, then phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you, or according to a transverse incision: and it is better, either to incise it with an incision, or to cut it with a section.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most people.
But if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the dorsum of the foot, and towards the little toe: and beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood you wish flow.
Then loosen the constriction, and place a leather over the place of phlebotomy, and bind the place.
For it heals quickly.
Concerning cupping, and the manner of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cups are made from horns, and from bronze, and from glass.
And cupping is done in two ways.
With scarification and the extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Or it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And there are fourteen places on the body where cuppings which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are applied.
One of which is the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are the two sides of the neck on both sides together: and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and the cuppings of Alachosos above the end of the spine: and the cuppings of the two elbows, and they are the middle of the two arms: and the cuppings of the two legs: and the cuppings of the two ankles.
And cupping indeed does not draw blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that, strength does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Nor is it necessary that cupping, whether with fire or without fire, be administered in any illnesses which occur from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity prompts cupping because of illness or habit, we administer it at any time at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
That is because there are men in whom blood multiplies until it needs extraction by cupping; they find heaviness and headache in their head.
And some of them find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And some of them find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And some of them scratch the place of their cupping. And some of them have increased laughter.
And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth; or the tongue is abscessed, and they spit blood.
And some of them have increased sleep.
And some of them see in their sleep blood and redness, and slain men, and wounds, and things similar to them. Therefore, when we see something of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order venesection to be performed, after two or three hours of the day have passed. The benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that it helps with heaviness in the head and that which flows down to the eyes.
