Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After having completed this book for you, which is the last of the sciences in medicine with its supplement, and having reached the end of it through its expositions and its declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of operation, namely, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery with the hand has been laid low in our region and in our time, and has been entirely privatized: perhaps the knowledge of it has perished, and its trace has been lost: and there remained from it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which were changed by hand: and they suffered error and hesitation, until their intentions were closed, and the vision of it was lengthened: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the order of this Treatise in it according to the way of its exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation: and that I should come with the forms of Cauterii's tools, and of the other instruments of work: since it is made from its declaration addition, and from its operation which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	However, the reason why a good artisan of it with his own hand does not exist in our time is this: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to be exercised before that in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the joints of the limbs, and their forms, and their connection and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and of the nerves, and of the tendons, and of their number, and of their exits, and of the pulsatilae of the veins, and of the quiet places, and of the outlets of them.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And on account of this Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have indeed already spoken of that in the introduction of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since those who are not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy are not spared from falling into error, in which men perish: as I have seen many of those who are formed from this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	Which is, because I have seen a foolish doctor to lance a scrophulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and he happened to cut some arteries in the neck: therefore the woman's blood flowed, until she died between her hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen another doctor who presumed to remove a stone from a man who had grown old, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore he reached him, and removed it with a fragment of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed I had already been called to remove it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the weakness of the sick man, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I have seen another doctor who received a bribe from a certain duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to an eunuch black man who was with him, a fracture near the calcaneum in his leg: and the doctor rushed with ignorance, and he bound the fracture over the wound with bandages, and a strong binding, and did not let out the wound's expiration.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he cured him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he sent him away for several days, and commanded him not to untie the bandage: and it remained thus until his leg became an abscess, and his foot, and it reached its destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called to him, and I hurried to untie the bandage: and peace followed, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption had already been confirmed in the member: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, corruption ceased to walk in the member, until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who pierced the cancerous abscess: and it became inflamed after days, until its evil was revealed to its master.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when the cancer is pure from humor melancholico, then it is not necessary to approach it with a knife at all, unless there is in the member that can bear, so that the whole of it be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, my son, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with hand is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation to which safety is associated, and the operation with which there is danger in many positions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already awakened in every place of this book, in which the operation comes where there is fear and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and dismiss it, so that the fool does not find a way to speak and disgrace himself.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Take therefore the measure with solicitude and protection, and the sick of yours with facility and firmness, and use them the better way leading to grace of God for salvation and praiseworthy succession: and dismiss terrible afflictions difficult of healing: and take away your souls from that which makes you afraid, so that hesitancy may enter upon you in your faith and your advantage.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is rather remaining to your glory, and more exalted in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen already mentioned this in some of his own admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You shall not treat bad illness: lest you be called a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	However, this treatise has now been divided into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of cauterizing with fire and of cauterizing with sharp medicine, chapters are arranged and ordered from the beginning to the end, including the forms of instruments and tools for cauterization, and everything necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Of cutting and piercing, bloodletting and venting, and wounds: and extracting arrows, and similar things: and the whole chapter is arranged according to the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Of restoration, and dislocation, and curing of twisting, and similar things: the chapter is arranged from the beginning to the end, and according to the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part one.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Of the benefit and harm of cauterization: and with which constitutions it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter one.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I mention the operation with it, it is necessary to say the quality of its benefit and harm, and in which constitution it is displayed.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the speech about the quality of the benefit and harm of cauterization is a long and subtle, knowledge, and secret hidden.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Also a multitude of wise men spoke about it, and they disagreed in it; and to me indeed it is enough little from their speeches, fearing the prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that the cauterizer universally combines with every composition, which is with matter and without matter: excepting two compositions, which are a hot composition without matter, and a dry composition without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, in the hot and dry composition with matter they have disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some have said that the cauterizer is useful in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of that, namely that the cauterizer is not suitable for an illness, which is from heat and dryness: because the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable, that one should be healed from a sickness of hot and dry, with hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of that said: that by cauterizing, a remedy is made for every sickness of hot and dry, which happens in the bodies of men: because when you compare the body of man, and its humors, to the composition of fire, you find the body of man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say by his word: because from experiment he has extracted that from me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not necessary, that he should come to that, unless who already tested, and trained in the chapter of cauterization exercise last, and knew the diversity of compositions of men, and disposition of sicknesses in themselves, and causes of them, and accidents of them, and time of them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the other compositions however there is not upon you fear: and especially in sicknesses of cold and wet.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For now all doctors have gathered upon them: and they have not disagreed in remedy with cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know children, that from the secret of healing by cauterization with fire, and its goodness upon cauterization with burning medicine is: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not hurt another member joined with it, unless little harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning medicine reaches to what is protruded from the limbs: and perhaps it causes to happen in the limb difficulty of healing, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire however, on account of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now indeed it has become known to us by experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and position above truth of things: and on account of that I excuse myself from length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if not, because it is not allowed to this my book, I would bring to you a secret hidden in fire, and quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, which expels difficulties by philosophical demonstrative speech, which would be remembered by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they themselves disagree in the time, in which it becomes to be done cauterization, and they put a better time for true.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say, that cauterization becomes in every time: because harm accidentally happening because of time is submerged in advantage, which is drawn with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if cauterization is because of pains from necessary pains, strong, urgent, who do not tolerate slowness: therefore because it is feared from them, that something evil happens which is greater, than small harm happening because of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And it does not fall in your minds, sons, that which they do not fear, except the crowd and stupid doctors, namely that to that difficulty which is healed by cauterization, there is not always return: and they put that following, and thing is not as they think: because cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which changes complexion, and dries wetnesses which are cause, why pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, the cauterizing instrument exceeds medicine by its speed of health recovery, its effectiveness in operation, and its power of dominance: and it is possible for the illness to return at some time according to the infirmity's constitution, location, and nature, and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities in him: and what reaches him in acquisition of his own from foods, and similar causes, unless illness occurs, in which cauterizing is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Subtle illness in a member of few superfluities and moistures, such as tooth cauterizing due to pain, and similar causes, is possible for that pain not to return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	Indeed, the common talk again, that cauterizing is the last of medicine, is correct speech: not to what they intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure that confers with medicine, nor with another after the fall of cauterizing.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the matter is contrary to that, and intention, that cauterizing is the last of medicine, is not, unless when we administer modes of cure in some illness, and those medicines do not conform: then we administer at the end of the matter cauterizing, and it conforms: then it falls, that cauterizing is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many stupid physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said, that cauterizing with gold is better than cauterizing with iron: and they did not say this, unless because of the equality of gold, and sublimity of its substance: and they said, that it does not make pus a place of cauterizing.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	However, it is not absolutely true that it does not do that in certain bodies without other things.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cauterizing iron itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat the cauterizing iron in fire from gold, it is not indicated to you when it burns according to the amount you wish, because of the redness of gold: and when it approaches the heat, and if you add more fire to it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls from that into his trade: and for that reason, the cauterizing iron with iron is made by us faster and closer, from rightness to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And indeed, I have already arranged this Chapter on Cauterizing, according to chapters: and I arranged them from head to foot: so that those seeking something from it might be helped.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Of the manner of cauterizing a head at the commissural collar.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterizing applies to the dominion of moisture and cold over the brain: which are two causes of sweat, and multitude of humors flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and multitude of sleeps, and pain of the teeth, and pain of the throat: and universally all kinds of distress, which occur from cold, such as paralysis, and sweats, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar to those distresses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The manner of cauterizing is, that you command the sick one: so that he may be emptied in the first place with the cleansing solution of the head three nights, or four, according to what requires the virtue of the sick one, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands in a square position, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your thumb on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Whenever your middle finger reaches that spot, mark it with a pen.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then heat the cautery iron, which has this form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the marked spot with the pen, with a descending motion, by which your hand is gradually tightened, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly withdraw your hand, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that the amount of bone from his head is equal to the amount of alquille or zeveherb, then withdraw your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the same iron, or with another one if it is cooled: until you see the bones that I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink it with the wound, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the salted drink on top of it in butter, and leave it on the spot until the scab of the fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Now they have said that the more the wound remains open, the more it emits pus: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and the cautery iron should be held until something of the density of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it should be scraped after that which was burned from the bone, then care for it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	Some say that it is necessary for the cauterio to reach the deepest point, until an impression of a fork is made in the jaw, so that the jaw falls out, as if by a kirate: or an instrument like that which women place under their infants when they are learning to write: and they claim that from this place vapors escape from the head, and the wound remains open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated until it is healed.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, however, these two types of cauterio do not appear at all in most people, except according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And it is better for me to let go of it with its own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened from the solution of its natural continuity: as we have shown in other members: and especially when the head of an infirm person is weak by nature: and indeed the first type of cauterio is more saving and better for me, and I use it: therefore I operate with it in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	§ On the method of cauterizing the head in the pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When there is chronic pain in the whole head: and it is prolonged in an infirm person, and he uses herbs, and cochlis, and caputpurgis, and oils, and emplastrums.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if he has already been cauterized with one cauterio, which we have mentioned, and does not give him anything from those: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of an infirm person is strong by nature, and is not weak, and has found a strong cold: then cauterize with another cauterio under it a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it on top of all the horn of its own head with a cauterio, so that it does not penetrate the skin, and expose a quantity of bone, as we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with a single cauterizing instrument at the back of its head, in the place called the "neck": and it is the place where the windpipe is located. And elevate your mat with this, and do not expose its mouth.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For indeed, it found itself in pain due to that very intense pain, and different from the pain of all other head cauterizations.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this Cauterium in its place: and it must be a cauterizing instrument, by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of its head is cauterized more delicately with a cauterizing instrument, by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cauterizing in headache, both with a burning medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and is evacuated with cleansing medicines for the head, and the remaining cure is administered, as I said in the divisions of ailments, and it is not all together: then cauterization in that place is done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But the cauterizing instrument with a burning medicine is, as you take one tooth of garlic, and scrape it, and cut off its extremities from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain at the time with a wide leech, until it becomes a place under the skin, in which the tooth is caught.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then introduce it into that place under the skin, until it is hidden: then bind it over it with a soft cloth, and let it go for fifteen hours, then dissolve it, and take out the garlic, and let it lie for two or three days: afterwards put on it a poultice soaked in butter, until the place becomes pus: then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with certain caustic medicines, which I have written about in my twelfth book on Burning Medicaments.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	However, the cauterization of it with iron is done in this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The cautery, which has this shape.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a Claw: because the shape of its head is like the shape of a claw, in which there is something of sharpness, and in the middle of it is a small elevation.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot, and hold your hand: and you will turn the iron gradually with speed: and the amount that is burned from the thickness of the skin, is like the middle of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, does not burn, and blood flow does not occur.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then immerse the wound in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then place the wound with butter: afterwards care with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second edge of the knife of the cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of the incision of the artery in this hemicrania, not anciently proper.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in an ancient hemicrania.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are curing a hemicrania, since what we said from the previous cure, and what we said in the divisions of pains, and that cure does not help: and you see from the pain, that what we said first with medicine, or with the knife of the cautery with fire, then it is necessary to burn the knife of the cautery, until it becomes white after the signs on the spot with a line, whose length is the middle of a finger, or something like that: and place your hand twice, and tighten it until you cut the artery, and reach up to the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuity of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, lest it be burned or a nerve that moves it be affected, from which spasms may arise.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this is above guardianship and precaution against the flow of blood from the severed artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its severing there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what it does, and is not diligent or experienced: and he leaves the operation with it first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with the remembrance of the management of the flow of blood from the artery according to its own mode and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the pain that this cauterizer does not suffice for him, and you see the weak body bearing the cauterizer in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, care for the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cauterizer which we said in the chapter of extracting the artery with a cauterizer having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more fitting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in pain of the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When it happens to the ear that there is pain from cold, and it is cured with ointments, and the rest of the cure which we said in division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and this is called a puncture, whose form is thus.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the punctures with it after its ignition in the circumference of the ear entirely, as it is turned around: or in the circumference of both, if the pain is at the same time in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And draw yourself away from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the spots with the cauterizer: and let the quantity of the cauterizer be ten punctures in every ear, and about thus.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the affected areas until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On how to cauterize in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The torture that is cured with cauterization is only from certain types that occur from phlegm, as we mentioned in the divisions of ailments.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And the type of torture that lacks cauterization due to dryness and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of torture with honey, and head purgatives, and gargarisms, and your cure does not help, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the sick person with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower from its time, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cauterization on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is, that you cauterize the sick person directly at the tip of the upper ear under the horn of the head a little: and another in the time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cauterization until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cauterization, and it is a species from a knife, of which the form mentioned above is: however it is not too sharp like that: and it is necessary that the knife be a little without excessive coarseness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the affected areas with what preceded until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On how to cauterize in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When ancient apoplexy is cured, and you treat it with what we said, and your medication does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations on all the horn of his head, and with the cauterization in the middle of his head, as we said, and with the cauterization in the back of his head, according to what preceded: and the method of cauterization should be according to what preceded.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the head of the sick person all over, and place on his occiput the plaster of synapi described in the treatise on plasters: and place it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is indeed the method of cauterization: and do it according to order, as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then do to him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which are descending from the superior part of his head down to the lower part of his eye: and place between every cauterization the thickness of a finger.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person: afterwards cauterize him in the middle of his head, and with a cauterizer over every horn of his head, and with a cauterizer on his back, and with three on his spines of his neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If you lack the ability to tolerate many of these mollifications for the body and are weak, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauterizations on the spines of his back, and with the last one, until the skin is burned off as much as possible, and raise your hand.

Therefore, you should cleanse his brain first with heirba, and with the rest of the cure that we mentioned in the division, when he is weak and large, or is unable to bear the medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if he is a child who does not bear the medicines, then a gargle is administered, and cleansing mastications of the brain are given before many days with good nourishment.

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cauterizer in that is according to two methods: either the cauterizer with fire: or the cauterizer with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cauterizer however with fire, order the sick person before that, so that he may let go his hairs, if it is from those who cover them, until they are lengthened and equalized.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If they prick him at the time of his birth: then bind his eyes with a cloth, so that they do not move, until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are born and have grown equal, then place the sick person's head in your lap: then mark the eyelids with a hot iron, mark it as it is according to the shape of the myrtle leaf: and let it be the beginning of the sign near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a wet cloth soaked in albumin on the eye: or in the mucilage of psyllium on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then with a hot iron, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape that you marked gradually on the eyelids, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of the myrtle leaf, entirely visible.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted, and the hairs raised at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So raise your hand then: and let him go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place a cloth with butter on him until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hair returns after an hour, and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cauterizing iron on that place, as you did in the first time.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If however the hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize that, until it is raised to its natural place: and equal it so that they do not prick the eye with the hairs.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is that you order the sick person, to let go the hairs, until they lengthen and become equal.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Prepare a form of a leaf from cloth using the pattern of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take known soap and unsoaked lime from one ounce of each weight, or about that amount, and mix them well with good friction, and make it quickly, so that it does not cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take a piece of cloth from the one you made into the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or two eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a wet compress soaked in egg white, and the sick person will be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your finger on the medicine and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it as often as the sick person feels the bite of the medicine, because its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	Therefore, while he persisted in what he found the bite to be, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	Therefore, when the bite stops, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid swelling, as it does with contraction with fire, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat over it from the medicine on the place where it does not press the medicine and does not stain, until your operation equals and the eye closes.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place a wet compress with butter on it until the burning of the skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with a diaphenic ointment or other, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation to keep the last guard, so that nothing falls into the eye from the medicine.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid becomes soft after days, and something fights from the hair in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which is softened from the eyelid properly, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself until you are healed.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the method of cauterizing in a lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you are treating a fistula, since we mentioned in the divisions of diseases that your cure does not work, then you should cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Tell the patient to place his head in your lap, and let him hold his head between your hands in this way, so that he does not move, nor move his head with his own.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a poultice of warm water on the eyeball, or in a mucilage of psyllium over his eye: then heat the cauterizing iron, whose form is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the form of a penfeather of a turkey from one end, with which the cauterizing iron is made: and if you wish it to penetrate up to the other end, and if you wish it to go upwards, thus try.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	But this concave is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and remove the pus from it, and dry it: and if it is not open, then open it, and remove the pus from it.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place then on it the cauterizing iron, which is made very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold with it your hand for a short time near the cauterizing iron, next to the eye, so that your hand does not wander, or disturb the patient: and place the cauterizing iron in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you reach the beginning of your cauterizing tool up to your mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cauterizing tool once or twice, depending on what you need from it: and let it rest for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a bandage with butter, and take care of it with drying ointment until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	But if forty days have passed and it has not healed: then place a sharp corrosive medicine on top of it until the mouth is detached: and shave it according to how it came in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some first said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Bend to the location of the fistula, and find it: then place in the wound a thin tube, that is, a thin cannula, whose form is as follows.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it an amount of a liquid lead drachma, and hold your hand with the cannula retention good, and not move at all weakly, so that it does not run, or the liquid lead does not reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And you should place on the weak eye's bandage an infusion of egg white or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the location of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	But if the fistula is healed, with what we said from cauterizing and cure, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nostril opening, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to how it comes to its own place.

Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you are caring for these fissures, since as we said in the division of diseases, it does not bring about a cure, then apply a small cauterizing knife with fire, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And its concavity should be according to the thinness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place the burning knife quickly in the very fissures, until the cauterizing knife reaches the depth of the fissures.

Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gingiva, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it discharges pus, and it is torn open: afterwards it is opened up, and pus runs out, and a fistula forms: then you should care for it, and it does not bring about a cure, then it is necessary that you apply a burning knife with fire, according to the amount that it can take in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the burning knife into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand there, until the burning knife reaches the depth and end of it: do this once, or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then care for it after that, with what we said about curing until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the pus is cut away, and it is healed, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the bone of the rotten part according to what comes in its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in gums, and molten teeth.

When the gum is molten due to moisture, and the teeth move, and you care for it with medicines, and it does not bring about a cure: then place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then place the cauterizing instrument, which will be shown later, on top of the tooth, and quickly insert the hot cauterizing tool into it: and hold your hand there for a short while until you feel that the weak heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And then lift your hand: and then repeat the cauterizing tool several times, according to what you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then the weak one will fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth is strengthened by movement, and the jaw becomes softened and contracted, and the corrupted moisture is dried up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Chapter on the method of cauterizing in tooth pain.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the tooth pain is due to coldness, or there is frost in it, or worms, and no cure is found with medicines: then the cauterizing tool is used in two ways: either with butter, or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	But the cauterizing tool with butter is as follows: you take some liquid butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a piece of cloth, and wrap it around the tip of the spoon.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then dip it into the boiling butter: and place it on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, dip a piece of cloth or a rag into the cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: and place a burning iron on top of it until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth's concavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But cauterization with fire is as follows: you direct it towards the nozzle of air, or the nozzle of iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of a thickness in his body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then place the cauterizing iron, whose form will come: and put it on that tooth: and hold your hand, until the cauterizing iron is cooled.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary that in the impression of that cauterizing iron, the sick person fill his mouth with good borax, and hold it for one hour: then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	This is the form of the cauterizing iron.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whatever end you can, according to what is possible: and this is the form of the needle.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in strophuli.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When strophuli are from phlegm, and from cold humidities, and they are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and you want to quickly digest them: then place the cauterizing iron, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that smoke comes out from the cauterizing iron from the other end: and put it on fire over the abscess once, and second, if you need it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small: then put the cauterizing iron according to the quantity of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then let it go for three days, and put on it a compress soaked in an infusion of marshmallow, until what the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then care for it with tooth ointment, until the form of the needle is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in rauco voice and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When moisture accumulates over the bronchial channel, and especially when it is accompanied by a cold constitutional state, then it is necessary for the sick person to be evacuated first with dissolved medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize the affected area at the root of the throat in a depressed location: and be careful not to let the cauterizer reach the throat, nor in the skin, except for a small part of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize the affected area at the junction of the neck in the last spine of the back: and let the cauterizer be a narrow one according to the mode that preceded it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what preceded it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the method of cauterizing in illnesses of the lungs and coughs.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When the cough and illness of the lungs are due to cold moistures, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor phthisis, and the illness is chronic: then cauterize it with two cauterizers above the backbone in depressed, loose, empty locations.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cauterizer in the middle of the chest between two breasts: and let the cauterizer be a needle according to the form that preceded it.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if your cauterization is by pricking with the cauterizer called the Puncture, whose form preceded it in the pricking of ear pain: and let there be punctures from thirty punctures almost to another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what preceded it until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now the cauterizer has three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore it is alleviated with that cauterization when you do it with one triple cauterizer.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	In the treatment of cataract in the tilt-up method, in the case of dislocated humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture and is not fixed at the time of its return from dislocation until it becomes a habit for him to return to its place, then when it happens as we have already testified, it should be reduced to its original position.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient should lie on his back, or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the cloth that is on the inside of the tilt-up to the upper part with your left hand fingers, and if the joint is dislocated to the inside.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then take a cauterizing iron with two holes.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the cloth until it penetrates to the other side, and the figure of cauterization with four cauterizations will come.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes cauterization is done with a cauterizing iron having three holes, so the figure of cauterization then becomes six cauterizations: and they are holes according to the thinness of the thread.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the shape of a cauterizing iron having three holes.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added to this mode, so there are eight cauterizations.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place salt-crushed onions on the cauterizing iron.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the patient stick to the quietness, so that the limb does not move during any time until he is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is to the upper part, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it on the arm with a claw iron, or with many puncturing cauterizations.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	On the Method of Cauterizing the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, until it is removed from its surroundings, and many catarrhs are multiplied to it, and continuous modes of treatment do not help: then it is necessary for the sick person to lie on his back, and extend his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, the cautery under the collarbone in the amount of one finger's breadth with the cautery hook, and two cauteries below from both sides of the cautery of one, until the figure of the cauteries triangular comes.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between each one so that they do not touch when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery should be the amount of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And the shape of the cauteries should be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and the cautery should be one according to the shape of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach should be cauterized by pricking it with the one that is farthest from this cautery: and there are signs on the stomach of a prick according to the amount, which you wish with the encaustic: then cauterize it with the cautery of the prick: then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On the Method of Cauterizing a Cold Ear.

Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold and moisture, or from excessive thickening, until it exits its natural exit excessively, and the sick person is cured, with what we said, and does not improve in that: then it is necessary for the sick person to lie on his back, and signs with the encaustic three cauteries according to this form, and the same amount of cauteries below the clavicle, where the arm of man reaches: and there should be space that is the thickness of one finger between each cauterium: and the cautery should be according to the straight length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of that which is burned be from the thickness of the skin, and the quantity of its middle not added: and let it be an invalid standing on its feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if it is not standing, then it is lying, who has already extended its legs and raised its arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible for you to cauterize this cautery with a scalpel, when you are skilled and prudent in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself, so that you do not proceed to cauterization to the end, and the thickness of the skin is completely burned, why the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: for the skin there is thin, so you know that.

Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens, and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick one suffers a sharp pain, and there is gravity without sharpness: and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with pain there is very sharp intensity: and you already see that its treatment has exhausted the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore it is necessary for the invalid to lie on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the shape of the abscess with the cautery: then burn the scalpel which is similar to a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that cautery one, until the whole skin is burned, and it reaches the intestines, until all the pus comes out: then care for him with the treatment of the sick, until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary to use this cautery species, unless whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hand these ailments with some experiments often come: then he dares to do this operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	In fact, it is better for you to leave it with me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery with the roots of Aristolochia should be applied to pleurisy in this way:
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you should take from the dry roots of Aristolochia a long one, as long as a finger, and it should be as thick as the size of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then dip it in oil: and burn it in the fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize it with one cautery in that which is between the connection of the wings with the neck, and two small cauteries under the guides a little inclined to the part which is under the chin.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs a little inclined to the backs: and with one cautery in the middle of the chest, and with another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from the backs: one in that which is between two spatulas: and two cauteries from both sides of the chest, lower with the cautery which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be in plain sight on the skin smoking.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancients have said that there are people who use a cautery from iron like a ray: and they burn, and they put it inside in that which is between the ribs, until it reaches with it to the swelling, and the pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of the eye.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this puncture with the cautery there is fear that either the sick person dies immediately, or it happens a fistula in the place which has no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	32nd Chapter on the Method of Cautery for the Spleen.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating the affliction of the spleen, since as we mentioned earlier, the cure lies in the division of afflictions, and your treatment does not bring relief, then cauterization is necessary in it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of these methods is to perform three or four cauterizations along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the liver cauterizations, preceding in the same figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And there should be a certain amount of thickness between each cauterization, about the size of a finger, or slightly more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And the method of cauterization should be equal to that which we mentioned for the liver cauterization.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand against the cauterizer: and let the patient be weak and lying on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	Another method of cauterization is: to ignite the cauterizer having two wounds, as we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: and raise the skin which is directly over the spleen where the arm of the weak left side reaches: and your elevation should be according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two burning wounds until you penetrate the skin from the other side: then remove the cauterizer: thus four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cauterizer having three wounds.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cauterizer after you have released it: to emit pus for many days, for it is more beneficial than all the other things that preceded from the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	33rd Chapter on the Method of Cautery in Hydropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cauterizer does not fall into hydrocephalus unless properly anointed.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat hydrocephalus with the methods of cure mentioned in the division, and do not find a cure, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauterizations around the navel, and one cauterization on the stomach, and one on the spleen, and two cauterizations after the back between the vertebrae, and one in direct pectoris, and one in direct stomach: and let the depth of the cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then let the cauterizer leave the wound open, so that it can emit pus over time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the patient from treatment after cauterization with him, for it is necessary that two intentions gather to him: and he will quickly come to him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	Indeed, the form of the cauterizer with which the belly is cauterized should be closed, according to its previous form: and the form of the one with which the back is cauterized should be oily, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	¶ On the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When boils form in hydrocephalus and are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and anular: and lift your hand with the cauterizer, and do not twist it: then lift your hand: and do not rub it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For yellow water does flow out, and the cauterizer should be in this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then do two cauterizations on both legs in every leg, and let the cauterizer be made with the extreme end of the cauterizer: and let the cauterizer be made according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other below it, around the middle of the leg: and two cauterizations on every hip: and let the cauterizer be left open without treatment for a long time, so that some water flows out from it: then cure it with the rest of what we said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Translation: "On the Method of Cauterizing in the Treatment of the Belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a solution of the belly due to cold and moisture, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers that are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with this method of cure, but not healed: and you see an infirm person tolerating a cauterizing instrument of excessive power, then cauterize him with a great cauterizing instrument above his belly, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the cauterizing circle, and four cauterizing instruments in the circumference of the umbilicus, with the fine cauterizing hook: and cauterize him with a great cauterizing instrument above the alhosos, or with two cauterizing instruments.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture and he is tolerating that, then cauterize him with a cauterizing instrument above the comb, and cauterize him on every side: and perhaps add two small cauterizing instruments near the great one on his belly.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a cure that is advancing, whose momentum does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Translation: "On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick humors, cold, or corrupt moisture, and they are cured with what we said in division, and not by cure: then cauterize them with three cauterizing instruments on the lower spondyle of the back under the almeidati a little triangularly, and cauterize under the umbilicus almost two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cooled and his food is not digested, and you see his face swelling, then cauterize him on his belly with a great cauterizing instrument, according to what preceded: and cauterize above his spleen, and another above his splenius muscle, with the fine cauterizing hook: and leave the cauterizing instrument open for some time: then cure him, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing an ulcer after its incision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you have incised the ulcer, then apply the cauterizing iron which resembles a needle.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the burning iron into the incised ulcer: and with your last hand, until the cauterizing iron reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flowed, do it once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the ulcers are many, then cauterize each one according to what we have related.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them, with that which heals them from the ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cauterizing iron above the skin, it is more painful.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When a weak patient does not obey the incision and operation which we have related in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he may be healed with the cauterizing iron.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	Therefore when a fistula occurs and is old, pus flows from it, and corrupted moistures.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is more appropriate that you probe it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the quantity of its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply the burning iron which is like a needle.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the burning iron into the fistula and the quantity in which it entered the closure.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the burning iron over it, until those corrupted bodies are consumed, once or twice or three times, according to the quantity of your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if it is there, or the great vein: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And you shall not do this, unless when there is a fistula in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed and the materials are removed from it, and it remains like this for a long time: then you will know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials are not removed from it, then you will know that it is penetrating, or there is a rotten bone in its depth, or something like that from them: whose memory will come back to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	About the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold, or heavy dampness, and it is weakened because of this: then you should cauterize the same above the almethenum on the kidneys, with a cauterizing iron over all the kidney with a claw, whose memory has been mentioned.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we should cauterize it again in the same place.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore, three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, they will be more effective in the bandage.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	About the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness occurs in the bladder, and softening from cold and moisture, until it does not retain infirm urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the inguinal on the bladder, where the pili pectinis begin, and with a cauterizing iron from the right inguinal, and another from the left of that: and the length of that cauterization should be according to the width of the little finger: and cauterize it with a cauterizing iron on the lower back, or with two cauterizing irons if you need them: and it should be according to what has been mentioned about the claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When fever and moisture occur in the womb and prevent pregnancy, destroy its menstruation, delay its call, and cause pain upon its arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize the womb with three cauteries around the navel, as we mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cauterizing iron on the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cauterizing iron be tight.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moisture is poured into the anus and becomes a cause of its exit from its place, and the sign of this is that the leg is stretched out over the other when compared together: and the place of dislocation is found to be empty in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the affected person on the anus of its own with a similar cauterizing iron in a circle: after you sign with the encaustic in the circumference of the anus, as it rolls: and so that the cauterizing iron falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cauterizing iron be of the same shape as in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cauterizing iron is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-oil cauterizing iron: and let the depth of the cauterizing iron be according to the thickness of the skin of the whole.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the anus and the causes are fever and moisture: and the affected person is cured with it, as we mentioned in the division, and does not recover, and it returns: then it is necessary to dissolve the affected person from thick humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either a cauterizer with burning medicines, or a cauterizer with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	A cauterizer with fire is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is, to cauterize on the anchor's pitch above three triangular cauterizations, in this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space be as much as the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cauterizer be oily.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes however the cauterization is made in the middle above the anchor's head.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauterizations.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes in the cauterization of anchor's dislocation, one: so that it contains the whole anchor.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin throughout.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in Sciatica, when the pain adheres to the anchor itself, and does not extend up to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If however it extends up to the hip and leg, then cauterize him with two cauterizations on the hip, on the place where the weak one indicates, in which is the pain, and with your cauterizer on the thigh four fingers towards the silvester part: and let the cauterizer be a knife.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the weak one indicates that the pain extends up to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize him there where he indicates with your cauterizer, three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with your cauterizer one knife.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterizations, so that you do not burn the nerves or a large artery, and pull through it over an injured person, causing more harm or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have seen one and another of those who cauterized above the ankle, and they perished in the cauterization, and the leg became inflamed, until a tumor formed at the foot, and it was completely pierced through, and the entire foot rotted: then dissolution of the belly followed, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in both parts at once, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men said about the cauterization of the ankle, which is this method of cauterization.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar sponge from iron, whose diameter is the middle of the palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of the nucleus of the finger, or a little less: and inside that sponge let there be another sponge.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be space between each sponge that is the thickness of a finger joint: and let the sponges be open from both parts: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make them handles from iron fitly adapted in the sponges.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in the fire until it reddens, and let it throw sparks: then let it be placed on the poultice of the ankle of the weak person lying on their healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cauteries in one stroke.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him rest for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then apply plasters with butter: and let the wound open be left for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, "In this manner of cauterization, my son, we have been very little used, due to the terror of its appearance; and therefore, because few people find it bearable to endure over it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless, it is from good cauterizations that one who undergoes it finds and discovers with it a place for it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterizing instrument with medicines adhering to it is made by you, who make two smears having a perforated ring, into which the card of its gate descends from the air or iron, length of the wall: whose height they are two knots, or as if they were themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be space that is the amount of thickness of a finger between both quantities of thickness, and be open below and above: and let it contain themselves adjacent to each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then lay it on the pepper box anchor, leaning on the sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand on the pepper box anchor much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles from hot water, which is heated with fire for a little while, and hold it for a temporal amount of time: and the sick person tolerates its bite and its burning, because he found the bite like fire, until the bite is quiet.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wash your hand with the instrument, and remove the hot water from the anchor entirely with sweet water: then let it go for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put on it butter, until the blackness of burning is removed: and let it go for several days, and drain out pus from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the last in the bandage.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a stance in what contains water, according to what you did in the equal anchorage.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unextinguished lime, each one part of the same: grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with a small hole according to the quantity that enters itself radius: and place under the bottom of the pot another glass pot: and throw on top of the alkali and lime from sweet water, which submerges both through a finger: after which you press it with your hand good compression: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather that water all, and throw it on top of another lime: and cook, until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be very strong acidity, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the operation of its fire.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from the medicines with which the anchorage are cauterized, also as tisis, and honey of cashew, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And indeed Galen himself reported, of a certain man from ancient cure, by which he was cured of the pain of the anchorage and sciatic vein: and magnified it to be very good.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, because it did not require other cure, and because he was healed from one vice, until he reported, because perhaps himself entered the bath carried, and exited from it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is also taken from the fresh sedategrass: and if it is not found green, a dry recent one is taken, and it is pounded much with some fat, and it is placed on the splint where there is pain, or in the leg, or in the hip: and it is bound, and it is let go for the quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the sick person feels sedation of the burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	And when his body becomes moist, introduce him into a bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain retreats, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that it is not necessary for someone to use a cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that, when the droppings of a goat are applied with it to the sciatic nerve, they bring him: and the cautery is made in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and it is poured with old oil, and it is placed on the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the toes, and it is near the toe.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take the dry droppings of a goat, and burn it in fire, until it becomes coal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool, and let it go, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	And do not stop doing that, until you reach the sense above the splint, and the pain is quiet.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the cautery of the goat.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	About the cauterization of the back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, or from an accident, or from a blow, or from an excessive evacuation, and from similar things, from the infusion of cold and wet matter: and the cautery does not fall, except in this species alone, which is made from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	After the evacuation of the sick person with fetid pills, and similar ones, it is necessary to place three lines across the back, where the pain is located, according to the width of his ribs, after marking them with a hot iron in every line, five or more cauterizations according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the sick person due to its virtue: and let the cauterization be made with a cauterizing needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizations, with a middle cauterizing needle, in this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of cauterizing in the beginning of gibbosities.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is: that a stricture occurs on him during breathing and movement, and it is found in the last rib and its nodes, which has already begun to rise above the other ribs.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see this, and wish to do it, then cauterize that with a cauterizing needle which is a circle in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let him take the cauterizing needle over all part of the rib equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the rib with a cauterizing needle two lines, or three: and they should be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place, until he is cured with that which we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, do not administer the cauterizing needle in gibbosities, which is made in a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing in gout, and pains of the joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When pains of the joints are from humidities cold, which are poured out to each limb of the body, then when they occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call that gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore treating Gout of the cold cause and with methods of cure, and the pains do not subside, then the cauterizer will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, that the cauterizer him after evacuation in the circumference of the joints of the feet, with many cautery: and let the cauterizer be olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	His this is the form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you lack to points on the face of the foot, then make with cauterizer point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pains ascend up to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize him above all the knee with three cautery, or four from every part, with this same cauterizer Clavi.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need more of this cauterizer, then cauterize him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with cauterizer, but rather it is about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend up to the knees, and back: then administer what we said from cauterizer in his chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	But if the pains are only in the hands: then points in the circumference of the wrist, as two lines turn.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if there remains from the pains in the fingers: then points them, over all the node point, and over the comb of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains ascend up to the elbows, or shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the sick person from good diet, from reception of medicines.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	¶ Of the manner of cauterizing in Hernia.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is close to the beginning: then you should advise the weak patient to abstain from food on his day of fasting.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives to facilitate the descent of feces from his intestine.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and advise him to hold his breath until the bladder or intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a red-hot iron under the rupture on the tongue with a sign indicating which end is similar to the middle of a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then heat the iron, which has this form, until it turns white, and throw sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or bladder to its natural shape.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let him place his hand on the spot where the intestine should not exit: and you have already opened between the legs of the weak patient, and placed under it a pillow, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hand.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the iron on the sign over him, with your hand holding the iron straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him until you reach the mouth with it: or repeat with it another time if you have not reached the mouth with it in the first attempt up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your burning, lest you burn it and cause death or great harm to the weak patient.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the iron, your operation is incomplete.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterizing instrument for children be thin, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with the other ointments, until healing occurs.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let him be weak lying on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to give his food in the length of time for his healing, which soothes his stomach: so that the intestine does not go out during defecation and excretion.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to rise after forty days, then give him a well-made bandage, and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And reduce his labor, and from the filling of food and drink, and from loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, thus he is healed with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will say the cure for hernias with incision in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When however the hernia occurs in the remaining belly, and they are beginning, and you want them not to be added, then cauterize his hernia with a round cauterizing instrument according to its quantity: and let that which is burned from then be as the third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for him, with what we said: and not added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some of the first have said: to cauterize the hernia with a triangular cauterizing instrument, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is signed with the cauterizing iron, and a line which is through the width in the upper side of the hernia, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the closed cauterizing iron.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cauterizing instrument is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	About the method of cauterizing for pain due to a fall, or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens to some members by accident or from a blow, and the pain persists for a long time and does not improve with medication, then it is necessary to cauterize with the point of a needle.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the cauterizing instrument should be of the same size and strength as the member, its weakness, its virtue, its twisting location, and the pain it causes.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is cured from the first cauterization, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cauterization over it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because of the habit of these pains, it is customary for them to change from the member to that which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary to follow them with the cauterizing instrument until the sick member is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	§ On how to cauterize in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	However, sometimes the leprosy is healed by the greatest cauterization.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of leprosy that is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy, therefore when you want to cauterize it, consider.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is incurable, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it has not descended nor stood still, and you fear that corruption will spread over the whole of its complexion: then cauterize it on the head with five cauterizations: one in the middle of the head, and the second below it towards the front at the end of the hair, and two on the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally your hand with the cauterizing instrument for a short time, until it makes an impression in the mouth, and the bones are dislocated from it: so that the expiration of thick vapors is relieved from it, and also cauterize the spleen with the cauterizing instrument according to what preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If the leprosy has already spread over the sick person and is clearly visible, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauterants, which we mentioned at the head, and a cauterant on the tip of the nose, and two cauterants on the two maxillae, and two cauterants on the spines of the neck, and six on the spines of the back, and one large one on the buttocks and one above it, in the same place: and two on the ankles: that is, on every ankle, and one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the chest, and two on the tendons of his chest. And cauterize him over all the joints, from the joints of his fingers and toes: and cauterize over all the heels of his feet, and the palms of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And spare you the nerves that are above the last calcaneus, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes he is cauterized with a cauterant on the tooth, and another on the stomach, and another on the ear.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add a cauterant, the more it is a remedy and the more it benefits.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cauterant, like healthy people do: because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterants be of a size and proportion according to his limbs and joints: according to what preceded from the kinds of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cauterant with flour of herb and honey, and the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in a stupor.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a certain limb is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries, according to the size or soundness of the limb.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cauterizing tool penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes cauterize for a certain numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, at the spine's exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness will be removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But do not presume over it, unless he is wise in the knowledge of limbs and the exit of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	§ On the method of cauterizing in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter L.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras is discolored and does not bring anything from the skills of medicine: then cauterize it with a deep cauterizing tool slightly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with flour of herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and blood of dove, and blood of goose: each one is a part of one: mix all these, and apply them to cloth, and stick to the place, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	§ On the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning and you want to stop it: then cauterize it with a cauterizing tool of a circle around it, as it turns.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise say, that it should be cauterized with the last cauterizing tool in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	To me, however, it does not seem that way: because I fear that it would become inflamed, and I have already seen this thing several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is more correct to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said, or with multiple cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 37.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an Adubelati and it is delayed in maturation, either due to excessive moisture causing it, or due to the age of an infirm person, when he is old and has little blood, or due to time, and you wish to hasten in the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around its circumference with small cautery needles by pricking.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let it go.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you wish to make a hole in it with a cautery, then use a cautery iron of this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of Adubelati until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery iron be from that which follows the infirm person, to relieve the course of purges.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in a corroding ulcer.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 38.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corroding ulcer is not other than a corruption in a moving member, and it corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corroding ulcer in a place that can bear cautery with fire, then use many cautery irons, small and large, according to what is suitable for that place where the corroding ulcer is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until the whole root of the corruption is removed, and nothing remains of it entirely.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and place on the cauterized areas ground sulfur with oil until all the scabs are removed and all corruption is eliminated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with flesh-generating ointments.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days the flesh is born with healthy birth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization on what remains from the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And abrading, heal sometimes with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it arises in the place of the cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the cauterization with fire is faster of healing: and indeed I have already said about its cauterization with sharp medicine in division: take it therefore there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	§ On the method of cauterizing in warts, and verucae.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Frequently it happens in the lower parts of the feet this sickness: and it is a rough, seeping thing which harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed the cauterization in them is according to two modes: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	However much with fire is, so that you ignite the cauterization concave like a penfeather: which is made of iron, according to the quantity it contains the claw from every part: and it is thin of the edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it burning on the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn your hand with the cauterization around the claw, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the claw: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply plasters to it with soft sulfur, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	He will be uprooted from his roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with a generative flesh ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply heat to them with hot water: and take a needle from the air, or iron, or from the feather of a bird: and place it on the wound, or althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw in the needle from hot water with a small amount of quantity: hold your hand and turn it with compression of your hand for a moment, so that the edge of the needle is pressed into the root of the wound, and the hot water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the wound: and wait for the weak one for a moment on the stinging of hot water for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let him go, for the wound is healed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do with them one after another, until you come upon all who are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are uprooted, with what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone Tremor from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or from another: then it is necessary to cauterize him with four or five cauteries on the spinous processes of the back, and between every spinal process cauterize, and in his chest cauterize, and over his stomach cauterize.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For Tremor is quiet with the cauterization of oil, and hastens the health of the cold sickness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul-smelling boils, known as abscesses, form in the body from corrupted coarse matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they first appear, they must be cauterized over the entire head of the boil with a fine cautery and a stick of myrtle, whose end is burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of a long-stemmed Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a round cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized a little at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase: and the excess is broken, which causes them, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it must be done after evacuation with venesection.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	About the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery into a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times it happens that the flow of blood from an artery cut at a wound, which occurs outside, or at the incision of an abscess, or a cauterized member, and similar to them, is difficult to remove.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when it happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and put your finger on top of it: and press it much, until the blood is held back under your finger, and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put in the fire a small and many cautery irons: and blow on them, until they are heated greatly.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or a few, or many, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on the vein after you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If the thorn is expelled from the opening of the artery and the hot iron is extinguished, then take another hot iron quickly, prepared from the irons that are in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease to do this with one after another, until the blood stops flowing.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerves which are there, and a new evil falls upon the weak one.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to remove it: especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a hot iron, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, the ends of it contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or they place on it remedies of its property, which is to cut off the blood and bind it with a decent compression.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But whoever administers its division with a ligature and binding with a cloth, and position of things that burn and similar, does not give it completely, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this happens to someone and there is no physician present nor medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have told, and bind it greatly, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not removed, above it with cold water of great cold always, until the blood freezes, and swells, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile he considers in it what is needed from the hot iron, or from the medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Puncture, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and Similar Matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	As we have said in the first chapter, all pain that is suitable for the use of a cauterizer and burning medicine, its causes, reasons, and instruments, and forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed chapters from head to toe.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I proceed in this chapter the same way: that it may bring relief to the one seeking what has been sought.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, you must learn, my son, what is in this chapter from the terror that is in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for that reason, there must be greater caution in it, because in the operation that is in this chapter, very often fainting occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of the vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of the exit, or cure of the wound, or extraction of the arrow, or incision on a stone, and those similar: from all of which, trembling, fear, and death often fall in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I advise you, not to fall upon you that in which there is hesitation, for sometimes such men with their ways of weaknesses come to you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is one who is angry with his pain, and is light in him for death: because of the vehemence of which he found from his weakness and length of his malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with pain is from fear that means death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from them is he who gives his flute to you, and gives you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not necessary to agree with him who comes to you from them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more urgent than his desire and your greed.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from him unless after a certain knowledge that confirms to you that the succession of that to which he arrives is praiseworthy.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use them in the treatment of all your sick, for diagnosis and indication of that to which it is properly healthful.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in him you have help for the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O son, his understanding, and not take from you direction and inspiration: for that is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed ordained this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter of cauterization, from the forehead to the feet: so that you may be relieved of what you seek from him, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	¶ On the treatment of water that gathers in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this weakness often occurs to children at birth: or when the midwife compresses the head of the child without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And also it happens even from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I indeed have not seen this weakness in other than in children: and to all whom I saw from them it was urgent for death: therefore it seemed to me to leave the operation in that.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	I myself have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was celebrated every day until he could not sit on himself due to the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	This moisture, however, either accumulates between the skin and the bone, or under the bones above the skull.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that case, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and it is a small abscess, then it is necessary to make a cut in the middle of the head, one in width, and the length of the cut should be about two knots, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	This is the shape of the lancet.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If however the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then place these two cuts according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the edges of the head open from all sides, and the water is pressed when you press it with your hand to the insides, and does not hide itself from you, then it is necessary to make three cuts in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the cuts with cloth and cotton.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then poultice it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then dissolve the ligament, and care for the wound with bandages, ointment.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not dismiss binding the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick person with every dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess appears and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes there is more in the back, or on the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore approach with an incision where you see the abscess and its filling with water, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, so that you do not cut the artery, and the blood flows out, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	¶ On the incision of the arteries which are after the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When catarrh occurs to someone's eyes, or chest, and it is not cured by medical treatment: then the last cure in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore when you want to incise them, so that the sick person may recover his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person ties his neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both are locations which are after the ears depressed: and it is rarely hidden, unless in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then signs with the cautery on both: and cut both with a narrow knife on either side, with the incision going to the bone: and let that be done through the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you want, insert a narrow knife under the artery, and cut it to the upper part with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the pulse is cut, the blood flows out in a small amount, which jumps to the insides frequently.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If, however, the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the distance of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with the cautery and probe until you reach the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which should be expelled from the blood is six unciae and perhaps you may expel more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the quantity which appears to you from the weakness and fullness of its artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains from the bone any flesh, then cut that, so that it does not become a hot abscess: then bind the wound with lint from cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	¶ On the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that he has ancient hemicrania, or sharp cataracts due to acrimonious humors, and heat in the temples, or old bile, strong, and similar to those: and he is treated with the methods of medical cure, and does not bear it: then we have experienced these pains in extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in their extraction is, that the weak hair which are in the temples be shaved, and he stretch to the artery appearing in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For indeed it is shown to you from its pulse, and rarely is hidden except in a few men, or by great cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	But if it is hidden from you, then he bind his weak head with any of his cloths: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or apply warm water to the wound until it appears manifest to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a small needle, which I previously shaped.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape away the skin with it, with ease, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then push the hook into it, and pull it out towards the top, until you have removed it from the skin, and make it recede from the garments that are underneath it from all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is delicate: then cover it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part according to the quantity by which their ends lengthen and contract, and do not let any blood flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood will not rise at all.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then wash out from the blood six ounces, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if the artery is large: then it is necessary to ligate it in two places with double silk thread, strong silk thread, or with catgut, so that it does not rush towards putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound, and let any blood flow.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a cautery knife: until their ends are cut off, and it remains in the place of that work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better work, unless if he is weak and has a fever, or a heated constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because the cautery is from those things which help to end moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better bandage.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, it is necessary to fill the place with old dough: and they should be placed on top of it, well-made felt.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution, it should be treated with dry medicines, which make flesh grow, and with liniments, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, while you are working, bleeding occurs from the artery, then hurry to cut it off with a cauterizer, or fill the place with zeugit: and tighten your hand until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If there is nothing present for you, then place your finger on the place until the blood congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And rub the place with hot water, until the sharpness subsides, and it is tied as it should be.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	Because it is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it is that with a cauterizer having two knives: let the sharpness of the two knives be like alum.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are as sharp as two knives, each frost hurries: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Since there is a little thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: therefore this work is better for all operations, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And there should be a space that is the thickness of a finger between the two knives, after you mark two places with encaustic: and place both hot ones very near, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that it is lengthened between its ends.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	They are not solidified completely with this cauterizing agent.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cauterizing instrument.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	About the care of the course of frequent, sharp tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are frequent and their course is from the eyes, which are above the outside of the skull: and no remedy of medicine is applied to them with other medicines, and you see the face of the sick already red, and feels walking in front of him, like the walk of ants: and his eyes are thinned, wet, so that already the hair on their pores is worn out with wear: and his eyelids are heated by the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients were in need of this cure, and called it a remedy, with the Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And you should order the sick to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut three fissures evenly spaced according to the length of the forehead: and the length of the fissure is about two fingers, and the fissure one is evenly spaced from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of the arm slightly, and the third on the other side: and beware of the incision of the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand away from the continuity of the two jaws, and all the quantity of the incision is three fingers together: and it should be a piece of sponge prepared, or dry cloth with which you dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a small spatula of two sharp ends, whose following is this form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is from the temporal side, to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between two incisions, with the scar, which is on the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then also do that from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this space, and insert again the second incision another tool, which is called a sharp knife, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh with the skin, and its smooth side towards the mouth: and push it until it reaches the middle cut: and cut off with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues until what appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle cut up to another cut.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after it has flowed out an equal amount of blood, press the places from clots of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place on every cut a piece of old cooked linen, and place above them cloths soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that no hot abscess occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the ligament, and administer a lot of infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with basilicon ointment, and with the other things by which wounds are cured: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ On the care of sharp tears and catarrh from the eyes from inside the head.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When catarrh occurs to someone sharp, acute, and frequent: and you see his eyes weakened, small, and already weakened is their aspect: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and they fall off from them, and in the deep of the head is sharp pain, wounding, and following sneezing: then take from these accidents that those matters, and catarrh do not come, unless from many vines.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	The best cure for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And you should command the sick person to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one incision in the middle of their forehead, or another slightly longer across its width, and begin from the left temple to the right temple: and the incision should reach the bone: and keep your hand away from the moving temples during chewing: until the bone is exposed: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with an old knife, or with linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie above with swabs: and soak the swabs with wine and oil, so that no heat abscess forms.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you cure it, and see that the heat abscess is beginning to diminish: then you must scrape the bone, until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with a dry diet that promotes the growth of flesh: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of pitch: and prepare an ointment from them, and administer it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	§ On the care of what falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or a similar stone, such as iron and lead: or it is a plant, such as peas and beans: or it is a fluid, such as water, and vinegar, and similar things: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone, or kind of stone, falls into the ear from those which do not add or grow in the ear, expose the ear alone: if you then see the stone, then pour something from broken oil, or saffron, into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer extraction of it, and make him sneeze with the conditioned powder, and wipe the nose upon the approach of sneezing, after you have placed in the circumference of the ear fragments of cloth or wool, and extend the ear towards the upper part.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For often it exits with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not exit, then administer extraction of it with Gesti, that is, Subtle Powder: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	Therefore if it exits with Gesti, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer extraction of it with a blind hook of few duplicates.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	Therefore if it does not exit through that, then make a cannula from air, and insert the end of the cannula into the ear canal far, and wipe what is in the circumference of the cannula with softened cera and oil, so that there is no wind way except through the cannula: then extract with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For often it exits with what we have mentioned.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not exit this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from uisco, that is, prepared glue with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the end of the radius after you have wrapped it properly over it: then insert it into the ear canal with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	Therefore if it does not exit with all that we have mentioned, then hasten to cut it before an abscess of hot pus, or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of cutting is, that you use a lancet on the weak one in the first in the cefalica: and extract from him according to the measure of its power from blood.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the weak one sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards the upper part, and cut a small fissure in the root of the ear at the fat of him in the place depressed by himself: and let the fissure be of lunar shape, until you reach the stone: then remove it with what is possible from your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then quickly cut a wound from your hour with diligence, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If something falling into your ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell: then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you at the end, then take a thin, delicate lance in this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting of that kind from the grains that fall into the ear, and do not do it when you think that that grain is already moistened by the steam of the ear, until you put many fragments: then extract them with hooks, or with a delicate forceps, or with suction, as we said, for its removal is relieved.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But in the water that enters the ear, it is necessary to use a weak sneeze with it first: and now it has filled its own ear with a little old boil: and it is lying on that ear, in which is the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it goes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, thin, gentle, and heat them with fire for a while, and let the weak one insert one of them into the hole of his ear: and salt on one foot of it, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore do not stop doing it with the stone and the stone, until all the water goes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water goes out so that you take one from the parpyro, or from the junco, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until it is burned very much.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the junco another, and do it many times, until all the water goes out: and extract it with a cannula according to what was prescribed in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of animals that enter into it, if it is small, like a flea or something similar, care for it as I mentioned in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and its matter is easier than all that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when you care for it with what we mentioned in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your cure does not join: then you must look at the ear in the sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	Therefore if something appears there from the worms, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is its form, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top: and insert its thin end into the ear according to the amount that an infirm person can tolerate: then suck with it strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to the end, then wrap a bandage around the cannula with clay, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with it, then administer the distillations that the ancients have already known in the infestation of worms: and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your outpouring be like the one you pour out oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which its form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	Just as you see make it from silver, or from brass, narrow at the bottom, in which there is a small hole, wide at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore let the pushing part that is in the hollow of the cannula be made from brass properly.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	If you wish, take the needle and wrap it in a piece of cotton, wrapping it properly: then apply oil, or honey, or whatever you wish from these remedies into the needle: let it be in the ear: then insert the needle with the cotton on top, and express it gently by your hand compression until the oil is pushed into the concavity of the ear, and he feels it inside: and what is poured into the ear should already be warmed slightly with fire: and beware that there is nothing that distills into it very cold, for remedies do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the care of the accidental affection of the Ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain children come out from the wombs of their mothers not perforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And now it also happens to some people that the affection of the ear occurs in the opening of the ear from a wound, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this affection of the ear sometimes occurs in the deep opening of the ear, which does not follow sight: and sometimes it happens to the outer openings a little, and follows sight.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore those which happen in the deep ear, and which does not include sight, is difficult to cure in many positions.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows sight, it is necessary to place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look at it: then if you see the affection appearing, open it with a narrow sharp needle, whose form is as follows, which follows, its end is in which there is a small width, whose part is sharp: and the rest of the needle is two-edged: so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the affection is born from flesh in the opening of the ear: then hold it with a narrow sharp knife, and cut it with great force, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the wax is deep in the ear, then take a thin, soft, and warm radulum, heat it slightly with fire, and then put it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel the wax with it that is found in the ear of an unhealthy person with severity, try to open it with ease: and beware, do not wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put linum in the ear according to the quantity of the width of the hole you cleaned with Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are secure about the consolidation of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take linum, and pour it into rosewater, and sprinkle powdered zeig on top of it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear is already abscessing, then it is necessary to remove the linum, and let it be with another linen cloth that you cleaned with a cerate made with rose oil, until the abscess becomes warm: then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if bloodletting occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water, and put it on the ear: and use the rest of the cure that stops the predicted bleeding in the treatment of distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the care of the eyelids of Althelia.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Althelia who occur in the eyelids of the eye, sometimes are moist, and sometimes are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary to hold them with tweezers: or with an uncinus, and cut them with a small knife from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then put powdered zeig on the places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens-shaped cauterizer.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For often they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	About the care of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often something similar to chilblain occurs in the eyelids due to its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called Grando: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore the operation in them is that you should consider whether it is chilblain proceeding from that which appears on the eyelid, and move to every part, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore find a cut above it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it off from every part with ease until it becomes soft.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a needle, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if the cut of it is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with the incision a little, then it harms the weak one in some place.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the cut is large: then gather it with suture and care for it until it becomes healthy.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, harm will not come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and covers it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if chilblain is declining towards the inside of the ear against the inner surface, then turn the eyelid and suspend the chilblain with a needle: besides which you need incision and press it from every part.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	But if the eyelid is stretched by incision, it does not harm it in some place.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the granite, with salty water: and care for the place with it that fleshs, until the sick one heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the care of Axiromath eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the upper eyelid skins: and indeed it often happens to children: and this one does indeed blind their eyes, and they are affected with cataracts in the morning, and they cannot see the sunlight, because their tears rush to them, and because of this you see them always lying on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are under wet arches, which have already been covered by inflation: indeed the eminence of Axirnath appears to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is, that the sick one puts his head on your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare linseed in it, and make from it a circle according to the amount that contains Axirnath from all parts.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put him on it, and press with your fingers from all parts, so that Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of its moisture with a sharp needle making incisions along the width, and let there not be an incision greater than that which is made in bloodletting in the deep.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary to make an incision in the whole skin, until you reach Axirnath, for indeed Axirnath proceeds from many arrangements through the incision according to the shape of a slice of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Then extract it with the cloth that you have placed between your fingers to the outsides: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is spread: and beware, do not add in the incision, so that it does not reach with the sharp needle to the eye, and you harm him.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If, however, Achirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you will add a little with ease into the incision until Achirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then dip the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are some who apply salt to it, and place it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remains from that moisture is melted.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if an abscess occurs in that hot spot, then care for it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	¶ On the ways of Ataxmir's eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft and the eye becomes loosed, so that it weeps as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs are born in the eyelids beyond their natural course under the hairs, and they become ancient: then they harm the eye, and cause afflictions, such as frequent tears, and softening of the eyelids, and the white of the eye, until that becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, Ataxmir's eye is cured according to four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, as was previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or it is cured by incision and sutures.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by cannula, as I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary to place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If he turns over, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert the needle into the one where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread above, and let it be near the hairs, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a spoon.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a small spatula reaching from the larger lacrimal canal up to the smaller lacrimal canal.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of charcoal or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with a hot iron, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it must be made into a shape according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: for it is already varied among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are those who need that a large amount of it should be incised from the eyelid according to the amount which is softened from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with a small spatula find above two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger lacrimal canal up to the smaller lacrimal canal, and let there be a fissure near the natural hairs, like the size of a ray.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape it all off.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather with a stitch two lips, with a needle and fine woolen thread: and wipe off the blood, and make that which superfluously flows from the threads on top of two eyebrows, with some things concealing it, if you want to make that: and if not, do not care.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let go of the suture and thread for three days, or four; afterwards care for that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, let go of the wound without suture, and care for it along with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the marking of the wound and its congregation, but a better one is to come.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of healing was taught by the ancients Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is worry over the weak one, and it is from good operation, and there is not in it fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, to mark the signs above the eyelid, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then raise the eyelid with three separate or aggregated needles, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equality of cutting.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the needle, and it is not equal: then take an awl in which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert the thread another near the lacrimal greater, and the thread near the lacrimal less: and gather the thread with equality between your fingers.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand evenly: and raise the skin above which is marked cloth, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather two wound lips with suture: and care for it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if indeed abscess happens at your incision, or your wound: squeeze the abscess with charred, and with such like, from ointments suppressing.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that their hairs turn.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you should use what we mentioned in the incision, but the suture on both sides is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	About the care of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, to turn back the eyelid and cut open the incision that is inside, as I have mentioned.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two splints, or two thin pieces of wood: their length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a fingernail: and you have already cut at the ends of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather each of them with thinness on top of what is excessive from the eyelid of the eye, and tie two splints from both sides with a strong knot, and let it be for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin will die, and blacken, and rot, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, elevate the eyelid: and do not prick the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the shape of two splints, which you will make according to this figure, and in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	About raising hairs that prick in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that is, to take a thin needle, and insert it into the hair with a thin silk thread, gentle.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather its ends, and tie both with a thin knot very tightly: and the length of the threads should be one finger.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make another thin thread under it in a short, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place the patient's head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation can be clearly seen: for this is a delicate or minor operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the probe with a curved needle into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you remove it from above with a natural spica.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the needle up to the curved needle: and introduce the needle into the curved needle: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it until the needle exits the eyelid with the curved needle and the natural spica.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the curved needle is drawn out, and the needle does not exit with it: pull the curved needle downwards with the thread that you have made in it, until the curved needle exits from the upper opening, and see it with the sight of the eye: for then draw out the curved needle and the thread: and remove both, and close the eye: and let him be closed for two days or three, until the needle sticks in its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	But if the needle is short, then associate it with a long needle from the natural needles, and elevate it with it: or let him be left until it lengthens after some time, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	¶ On the care of Alexander that happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alexander's disease happens to the eye, it is called Leprosy.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alexander's disease is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore it becomes accidental from the consolidation of the wound, or cutting, or cauterization, and similar to those.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	The method of operation for this is as follows: you should find the consolidation and separate her lips, and place a linen cloth between them, and bind it up until she heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you should not use things in her treatment that dry and constrict: for if you do this, the Alexander's plaster will return worse than before. Instead, use things that soften, such as fenugreek, and embrocate with water in which althea has been boiled, linseed oil, and Dyaquilon ointment, which has been melted with some oil: and wrap up the linen cloth with this, and take care of her.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	Your treasure for healing is to try by all means to prevent it from becoming consolidated according to its original form.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	Indeed, this operation that we mentioned is nothing but a certain correction of the Alexander's plaster, so that it does not return to its original form at all.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	¶ About the care of the Alexander's plaster that is made on the lower eyelid, and there is a wrinkle or contraction upwards towards the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alexander's plaster that is made below is what is truly called the Alexander's plaster.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is both natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is made from a wound, or a tear, or a cauterization, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	The method of operation for this is as follows: you should take an awl, in which there is a double thread, and stain it with flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with the awl, and cut it with a broad-bladed knife.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If the figure of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the probe, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle: until when they gather, this figure is formed, and it is the Greek letter laud.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount that is the sharp side of its width, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts: sew it with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with that which we said, with softening medicines and liniments, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if Alexander occurs from the fissure, and the suture, or with a cautery: then it is necessary to make the fissure flat under the eyelashes, even as it preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between two lips with liniment, as we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the main word of speech on the care of Alexander, when it is above, or below, is that it should operate in it, according to how it is prepared from the form of Alexander.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For indeed it is of many diverse forms: and the skillful artist prepares his ingenuity with whatever way is possible to him, until he makes it return to the natural form, or near to it, and himself the sick man, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	¶ On the adherence of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the whites of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore you must insert the tip of the radius under the eyelid and raise it up: or extend it with a blunt hook, then cut the adhesion with a thin, sharp spatula, which is not sharp with the incision of the spatula, but rather blunt for a moment: so that the weak one does not suffer from the operation, and the spatula is removed, and it does not injure the eye with its sharpness: and your incision is as if you were excoriating that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion is completely healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, with clean water washing it: or sprinkle it in the eye from a sharp-edged vessel made of tin, dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a soft linen cloth: and place on the eye wool soaked with albumin: and after three days use the sharp-edged vessel, and with solidifying agents, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	¶ On the incision of the nail and prominence of flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is nervous: and it is similar to a sharp-edged vessel, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen moisture of white: which when it touches the flesh of iron, or you try to take it with a hook, it is cut off, and does not stick in it the hook.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both species do not begin, except from the greater tear duct, until it gradually approaches, until it covers the eye, and prevents light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	The method of operation for this incision is: place your infirm head in my lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and raise his eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the claw with a small fold of skin and extend it to the upper part.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle and insert a small hair from a horse, or a goose, into it: let the thread be strong, and double the tip of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the claw; and pierce it with the needle, and tie it with the thread, and extend it to the upper part: and scrape the side of the claw that follows the pupil, as if you were pulling it with the hair up to the end of its tail.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal duct with a fine saw, or with small forceps: and let out the natural flesh of the lacrimal duct, so that it does not happen from its incision that the course of tears is constant.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the claw is extended with a single fold of skin: or with a thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with a fine saw, whose shape is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the fine saw touch the horn-like skin of the coat, and a rupture occur in it, and pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, put something finely ground salt into the eye: or some powder made from sewage, and let it out until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for him with what is necessary until he is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the claw is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor fix it with a fold of skin, then often this kind of claw is cured with medicines, and heals as I described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to pierce it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a thin, soft, weak, sharp spatula according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the hoof above the ridge with delicacy.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is rarefied and broken, then put a needle into it, and drop some water from your hourglass, or red wine, or finely ground salt, into the eye made from sieves: and let the patient keep their eye closed until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation on it until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless the opposite is true for you in your eye, that is, a hot abscess: then let it go, and cure the abscess until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with the needle, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the prominence of the eyelid is causing harm to the eye with great damage, it should be suspended with a needle, and cut from that part: and do not complete the incision, so that the course of the tears does not run out.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then drop some red wine from sieves, or finely ground salt, into the eyelid until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	¶ On making an incision in Alghardin and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Flesh sometimes grows in certain human eyes, composed or placed on top, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or stretches over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards: and it resembles a rose of balm.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also that he should place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with the appropriate needles: and hold it with one forceps, or grip.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh at first, until it is all finished with the knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so as not to wound it during the operation: and your incision should be with a small knife, which we mentioned in the incision of the hoof: or with small forceps, with which abscess is collected, according to the form it will have after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is completed, and the entire guardian [guard] has been removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or pour in powdered red earth, and similar things to it from corrosive medicines: and place on the eye a bandage with egg white: so that it may be securely protected from pus hot.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If however something remains of the guardian [guard], and hot blood dominates you, and you fear pus hot: then let go the eye, and care for it with that which calms the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with the flesh added which happens to the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	But indeed, it is necessary that you operate on all weak eyes from the natural way, or from the accidental way, with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations, until you see that that member is able to bear that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	§ On collecting abscess from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Abscess are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent their own operation: and weaken the eye with the length of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider, whether the eye in which there is abscess, is strong, and there is no other ailment in it, except abscess: then collect the abscess from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	It is also advised that you instruct the sick person to place their head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those needles with a single pin, or two according to your judgment: and let the pin be thin for doubling, in this form, or there should be two pins graduated in one body, in this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then gather those needles with thin forceps with delicacy, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those needles being removed from the eye, and dissolve: and beware not to injure the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	Let your operation be in the middle of the day in front of the sun, and be firm in your operation greatly: so that you do not cut except those needles.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have filled, then pour into the eye some green or red wine: so that its sharpness corrodes what remains from the cataract.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if it is not possible for you to gather all of it in that hour, then apply ointments to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for several days, until the pain settles: and secure it from the boil with heat: then repeat over it according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	¶ On the reduction of Arissatus to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctors name Arissatus' fistula, which they cure with a cauterizing iron, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what precedes its narrative.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not healed, then there is no skill in it: unless you find above the boil at his birthplace, and remove all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is revealed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is exposed and you see decay or discoloration in it, then scrape it with an instrument whose shape is as follows:
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the "Asper of the Head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron and its head round like an azir, which is dotted with a needle or a fine needle puncture: and place it on the location of the decayed bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand on it slightly until you know that that corruption is now scraped away: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the location with dry hemostatic remedies.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the location consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the course of pus is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and does not reopen, and does not become a boil, and no evil happens to it: then you know that it is healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you scrape away from the bone second with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, its end be iron, triangular: and the wood of it be a flattened pyramid to the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the bone itself: and it be near the lacrimal: and lengthen your hand away from the eye slightly.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the drill, until it pierces the bone, and feels weak: because of this that it has found the wind coming out of it, when it holds its hand on its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the location with dry hemostatic remedies, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When flesh is born and the spot becomes hardened: then the matter that flowed to the outside returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter on the weak.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of a protruding Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs: then it is necessary to dissolve the weak one: afterwards give him a bloodletting: then place ventilating bandages on the forehead without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place a liniment made of acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla on the eye.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bandage the eye above with a plaster with many woolen cloths.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the woolen cloths is: take many soft cloths, double each one over on top of four: make many from them: then place them one on top of another according to the amount that the eye needs: then bandage them with a hard cloth with a strong bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the ventilating bandages with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the ventilating bandages, and let the eye be loose during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bandage becomes soft again, then it is necessary to bandage it much: then remove the bandage during the day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye now returning to its own skin, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, woolen cloths, bandage, and ventilating bandages until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the incision of the eyeball skin.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the eyeball skin, and it protrudes and extends outside the eyelids like a grain of the eye, and disfigures the form of the man because of that, and you want to cut it: then the operation in him is as follows: and it is, to insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle through which a double thread is placed near the lacrimal canal, and make it pierce: and let it go out the first needle according to its arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie it with that part of the needle in a circle: and stretch it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the needle, and place a thread soaked in wool on the sclera of the eye: and let it go out until the thread with Vua falls.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes Vua is stretched from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye gains great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce with a fine needle that reaches the depth of the eye, and drain the moisture from the sclera, and the eye descends, and enters immediately: then tie it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	¶ On the treatment of Alcomnatus.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnatus is not, but is only pus that accumulates in the eye, similar to water descending, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the mode of operation in it is, that you make the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or directly.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head with your hands from both sides, and move it, until you see the health reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then shape it, and do not let it descend, and the light is cured: and the sick person sees as he saw: and if it does not descend below, you know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the preparation of the descent of pus with what we said does not happen, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine needle and prick it through the thin skin above the horny layer for a short distance at the point where it is joined to the corneal tissue in the horn of the finger, until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then pour warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey: or warm water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the care of water that flows into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already mentioned the appearance of water in division, and what is suitable for piercing according to speech declaring and explaining it, then take that same one according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then therefore you must do that sit the sick person between your hands squarely, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind the healthy eye, and tighten it very much: then open the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which is water, is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand alum if the eye is left: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the alum near the corona through the thickness of the radius in that whiteness of the eye appearing lachrymalis minoris: then push the alum with power: and you turn it back with your hand, until it penetrates into the sclera of the eye: and you feel, that the alum already reached the empty.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it must be that the measure of the journey of the alum to the depth, is the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the darkness: and is the corona of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see these things in the very act of vision within the pupil of the eye, due to the clarity of the tunica corneae.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place an almagra up to the point where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it down with one hand after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water immediately comes down, then the sick person sees that thing on which he opens his eye immediately, and the almagra is in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water comes down, then lay it down on the second, except that the almagra goes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it sticks, and does not rise: then take out the almagra with ease: and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from clear salt crystals into water: and wash with it the eye inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place outside the eye all the bandage, or dyed wool with rose oil, and with white of egg: and tie with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are of our time, put on top of him mold powder with white of egg.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If therefore the almagra does not obey you at the entrance into the eye because of its hardness, since from men is that whose eye is very hard: then you must take a small spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	For therefore pierce with it that very joint together, and do not extend your hand in the hole: and there is only so that you make a way to the almagra subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagda, as we said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a bed made properly, in which he may lie on his back in a dark room: and be prohibited from all movements, and from coughing: and place his food that which soothes his nature: and not move his head at all with his right, nor at all with his left.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the suture be according to its proper arrangement up to the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house, and test his sight; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the suture up to the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not proper to do it at the time of healing or immediately after the incision; rather, it should be done by others for that reason because water ascends quickly through a strong gaze.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a boil becomes hot: then it is necessary to dissolve the eye before the seventh day; and correct it with what calms the boil until it is calmed down; then cure his sight, and place on his face an ointment that regulates his sight for several days while he is still in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should gradually leave the house and return to his usual activities.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that the student is not excused from visioning several times in the zaita: then he dares to perform the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	Indeed, one of those from Alayrach has come to us, who said that something happened in Alayrach where a man was pierced through the magdan, through which water flows.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But indeed I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read it in any of the old books: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from the magdan, so that he stands on them who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of air properly; and their ends should be with the same subtlety of a triangle, and the sharp end.
Formae magda.	Forms of magdan.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	¶ On the care of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	At times, flesh of various kinds is born in the nose, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion's many feet: and from this flesh there is cancerous flesh, stone-like, of a dark color: and from this flesh there is what is flesh that is gentle, not of a dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, in that which is from those flesh that is gentle, not deceitful, nor cancerous, you should do that the infirm person is placed with his hands opposite to the sun, and open his nose, and thrust a hook into those flesh: then draw them out to the exterior, and cut what you have grasped from them with a thin, sharp knife from one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If something remained from that from which its removal is not possible: then scrape it with one of the thin tools with ease, until there is nothing remaining from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood dominates you, or an abscess hot: then place on him what is necessary: or it is from malignant abscesses, then hurry to cauterize him, until the blood is cut off, and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then thrust into the nose after incision vinegar, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose opens, and proceeds from it moisture up to the palate, then know that he is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that there is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, to which the tool did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then therefore you should insert a thread of linen in which there is something rough, and many knots in it: and place between every knot the quantity of a finger, or less: and the infirm person should thrust one end of the thread into his nose with a hook, or with what is possible for him after he has made it similar to an awl: and draw out his smell, until it reaches the throat, and goes out over his neck.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And often indeed they do something similar to this Attomi boy in schools: and it is an easy matter for those who want to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which exits above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then with a needle cut the flesh with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots on the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then remove the thread: and place in the nose after cleaning the blood linen that you soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has corroded all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place at the end of the matter in the nose a lead tube, for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it needs cure that has dried, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the purpose of head purging, with which the oil and other medicines distill into the nose, do this from silver, or from air: that it is like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for head purging, be full, open: which has a handle at the end of it, with which you hold it, when you heat oil, or what you want to extract from the successes, and flexible things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	About the care of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a Thelul is born at the end of the nose, and it becomes large and grows with the days, until it becomes ugly in appearance.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this reason, it is necessary to cut off that part at the beginning of its appearance and uproot the entirety of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the place, a cauterizer or a burning medicine that remains in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the incision of it delays until it becomes swollen, then consider if it is stony, hard, dark in color, and has few sensations: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen that when a human abscess is incised, and evil results from it upon him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is gentle to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the weak part, and incise it without fear, without hesitation: and care for the place with what dries and contracts, until it becomes healthy.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On sutures of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when dissolution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, it does not much hinder the operation, except in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore when something happens to someone from that, you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then gather the drainage of the wound with a suture: and then care for it until it becomes healthy.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the dissolution of continuity has already separated the lips, and each part is healthy: then it is necessary to scrape off all the part from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather two lips with a suture, and bind them, and powder over the blood of a dragon, and ground frankincense: and place above the powders a fragment of the plaster diafinicon, and some other from consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two days or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it and exchange the medicine: and let it go, until the threads are separated by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	However, the method of stitching is to gather the solution of continuity, or with a needle, as we have told you about the ventral suture: or gather the solution with thread, as I have taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	¶ On the extraction of lip knots.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people indeed often have hard abscesses like grains of herbs in the inner parts of their lips: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to turn the lip, and cut over every knot of it, and hang it with a needle, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with ground zeig, until the blood is separated.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it is to be covered with vinegar, and the place is to be treated with it, where there is a styptic, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	¶ On the incision of flesh on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Frequently flesh is born on the gum, which the ancients call an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary to hang it with a needle: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the wound run, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on the place ground zeig, or other styptic powders, drying.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after healing, for it often returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the ratio of teeth with a file.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes, the enamel of teeth can accumulate on their outer and inner surfaces, and between the gums, forming rough, discolored, and sometimes yellow or greenish spots, until that corruption reaches the gum line, causing the teeth to become foul.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should sit the patient with their head in your lap, and scrape off the enamel and the tooth where the roughness appears to you like sand: until nothing remains of it, and do the same for discoloration, greenishness, yellowness, and other corruptions until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If, however, that which is at the beginning of their ratio is removed, it is good: and if not, then repeat the filing on them every other day, second day, and third day, until you reach the end of your desire in it.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth requires filing of various forms and many figures, according to how it is prepared for your operation: therefore, because the file with which the tooth is filed from the lower part is different from the file with which it is filed between the teeth, in other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And those forms of files should be prepared by you, as you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You should cure the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and delay its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it does not fill the space when it is extracted: because it is a substance that is elevated: until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then when the sick person must extract it himself, in order to strengthen and be certain of the tooth that is causing pain.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many times indeed deceives the sick person the pain, and he thinks that it is in the tooth and will remove it: then the pain does not go away, until the weak tooth is removed.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletters.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Therefore, when the tooth itself is examined by you, then it is necessary to make incisions around the tooth with a sharp spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps, gradually at first, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then in that place use large forceps with good location, and the head of the weak one between your knees: which you have already held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to straightness, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take some of those instruments, and insert it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did in the first place.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is perforated, or corroded: then it is necessary to fill the hole with cloth: and tie it with the tip of a delicate needle, so that it does not break in the hour of your contraction above it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary to do carefully with incision around the gum from all sides much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and part of it remains, and return to the weak one from that malice which is greater than his first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, that you do not do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste, and the audacity of them over its removal, besides which they administer that which we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many times do people suffer from great ailments, which are difficult to treat and completely remove, or some of their causes remain, or they require the extraction of certain teeth along with them, as we have often witnessed.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be covered after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If there is bleeding from the wound (for it often happens), then apply some zege and fill the wound with it, and if you do not have zege, cauterize the wound if it does not heal for you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the delicate forceps by which the tooth is moved should be long at the tips, short at the handle, thick, so that they do not duplicate when pressed against the tooth: they should be like the handles of thick forceps, until when you squeeze them together, they do not bite themselves or duplicate: short at the tips, and made from straight iron, or from a well-made piece of wood, direct extremities: and in their tips there should be teeth, some of which enter into certain places and grip with a proper contraction, strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes they are made like the tips of a bird's beak called a stork, and they are strong in contraction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth and the extraction of mandibular tooth fragments.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains at the removal of a tooth that is broken, then you should place butter on the wound for one or two days until the wound becomes soft: then insert algasti or forceps: whose tips are similar to the tip of a bird's beak called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	However, this is the form of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like a razor's edge: or like an axe's blade.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not obey you at the end with these forceps, then you must make an incision over the root, and tear away all the flesh, and insert the instrument called the small hook, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let its length of the extremity be short, rather coarse: and not soaked, that it may not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root goes out through that, it is good: and if not, you must squeeze with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is a certain coarseness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the thin triangular extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also squeezed with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that preceded in the ratio of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also a squeezer with this instrument that resembles a large hook, of this form, the twisted triangular extremity, in which there is a certain coarseness, so that it may not break: and it is not soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that the teeth's instruments are many: and similarly the other instruments are not counted, and a wise craftsman, skillful in his art, has found for himself by himself the instrument, according to what signifies to him the operation and the pains of themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because from the pains to which they did not say the ancient instrument, because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the bone of the jaw is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then to examine over it in its place with that which suits him from the instruments and forceps that I said in the extraction of the root, and squeeze with the one holding, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Sit in that place a certain thickness gradually, so that it is tightened or held with the mouth, and does not flee and flow until it exits the mouth: and restore the place with suitable medical remedies to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction and cure it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the extraction of teeth that protrude over others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth that protrude do not follow their natural course, it becomes disfigured by that form: and especially when it happens to women, and girls, that is, virgins.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if the tooth is born after another tooth, and is not placed, or is not possible to extract it, or to cut it: then eradicate it: and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made of iron, sharp at the end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cut be where you cut it into many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another is not moved from the teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, it is exposed to being cut, then cut it with a file of iron, whose form is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It is all of iron, and the handle of its puncturing points is sharp, like a file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is cut gradually in many days with ease, so that the tooth does not move, and falls: then gently it, at the end scrape it with some rasors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth from which a part breaks off and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary to cut it even, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is flattened, and does not hurt the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the extraction of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth are shaken or dislodged by a blow or accident, and the weak person cannot hold them in place while eating so that they do not fall out, and you have treated them with hemostatic remedies but the cure has not improved: then it is wise to bind them with gold wire, because silver turns green and rots after a few days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of medium thickness in thinness and coarseness according to the quantity that it can hold between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the binding is indeed to take the wire and insert a double amount of it between two healthy teeth: then weave the two ends of the wire between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the thread up to the healthy tooth of the other part.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving up to the part from which you began: and bind your hand with thinness and wisdom until it is not removed at all: and let your binding be where you bind the wire, at the roots of the teeth, so that they do not loosen.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the wire with forceps: and gather each one, and fold them together with the hand: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth, so that they do not hurt the tongue: then let it be left as tight as it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it dissolves or breaks, bind them with another wire, and it will stand with it in that way for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the shape of the binding of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two return to their places after the accident and are held as we have described, and remain: and this is only done by a wise and skilled craftsman.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece of bone from a cow is used: it is shaped like a tooth and placed in the spot where the tooth was, as we have said, and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	About making an incision in the ligament under the tongue, which prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament under the tongue is natural, with which man is born, or accidental, due to a wound that has healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is to open the mouth of the sick person in your lap, and raise his tongue: then cut that nervous ligament across its width, until the tongue is released from its hold.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is due to the healing of a wound: then push that hook into it, and saw through it across its width, until you cut the ligament and release the knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a deep cut in the flesh, and you cut an artery there, and blood flows out.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then cover the wound with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen bandage under the tongue, which holds it in place all night: so that it does not become solid again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however blood flows out, then put charcoal powder on the wound.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the blood sticks to you, then cauterize the wound with a suitable cauterizing iron, and then care for it along with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	About extracting a tumor under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function: and perhaps it is so enlarged that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in it is that you open the mouth of the sick person before the sun: and consider the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	Therefore if you see it with a dark or black color, hard, which the sick person does not feel: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then thrust the hook into it, and cut it with a thin sharp knife, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	But if the blood resists you in your hour of operation, then place on it zegi powder until the blood is removed: then return to your operation until you remove it with its supplement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be covered with vinegar and salt: and care for the remaining cure according to the appropriate cure until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	¶ On the cure of two tonsil abscesses.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes they occur between the throat, that is, the glands, which resemble algodad, which occur in a deformed way: and they are called two tonsils: which when you cure with what we said in division, and do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	Therefore if it is an abscess with a dark or black color, little feeling: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red in color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, indeed leave it until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it yourself: or it will burst on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is delicate: then it must be incised.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is as follows: you should consider before the operation whether the abscess of its heat has been completed quietly, or whether it is diminishing by some reduction: then therefore make the sick person sit in front of the sun, and his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and let a servant take between his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, of which this is the shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	It should be made of silver, or of brass, which is as thin as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	Then when you press his tongue, and the abscess is shown to you, and falls on it your gaze: then take a hook, and fix it in the socket, and draw it out as much as you can, except that you pull with it some from its clothing.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument of which this is the shape that follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is shaped like forceps: however its extremities should be protected, so that the opening of each of them is directly opposite the other sharply: therefore care must be taken that it is from iron inlaid, or alloyed with lead.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a narrow knife of which this is the shape.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one socket, cut the other according to this same shape of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the cutting the sick person should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if blood flow occurs to him, he should gargle with water in which boiled are the kernels of pomegranates: or leaves of myrtle, and similar things from stiptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then care must be taken for him, until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other pus-filled cysts are born in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut them as I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	Indeed, I myself have already treated a woman with a pus-filled cyst that was born between her throat, which was being dragged to the neck, with few senses, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow opening, and had already prevented her from eating and drinking water: and she had reached the point of death if she had remained for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the pus-filled cyst had risen so much that it had emitted two branches, until they had extended over two nostril openings.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Therefore, I acted quickly and fixed one of them with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I drew it out, and a large portion was drawn from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where it had been grasped from the nostril opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to that which had protruded from the other nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: and then I fixed the hook in the pus-filled cyst: then I cut from it a part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it: therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not stop cutting from that pus-filled cyst many times over a long period of time: and the pus would take its place where I was cutting, until it had become too long and with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore, I thought, and cauterized the pus-filled cyst between her throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	So I stood by her and added something, then I walked away from that part, and I did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of the wound of the vulva.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the vulva and becomes an abscess, and is long, then it is called a perpendicular abscess: and if it is in the lower part, thick, round, then it is called the womb.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with what we said in the division, and no cure is joined to it: and you see that the abscess has become quiet from her, and is thin: then it is necessary for you to cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is gathered from it is round, and there is no length to it, and it is bloody, or of a dark color, or black, and there is no sense in it: then it is necessary for you to follow the incision of it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in it is fear for the weak.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore when you see it according to the manner which I said from its whiteness, and its length, you should make the weak person sit in front of the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument of which there is a previous account: then fix a hook in the vulva, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of the two instruments which I said in the incision of two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not cut from it, except that which is added above the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will damage voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we said in the incision of two tonsils: and cure it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the weak person is frightened by the incision: then you should use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	The method of cauterization in this case is not applicable, except when using sharp water (steam): and it is to place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unextinguished lime, and place it not thick nor fine, and fill the hollow of this instrument, whose shape is as follows:
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremity of it which holds the medicine have a hollow, like the hollow of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the same spoon: and let the sick person lie on his side, so that salt may run out from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing may descend from it into his throat and injure him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first of it on the spoon a quantity of half an hour, until you see it already darkened and quieted the biting of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take wool, and uncover it at the end of the spoon, and pour the wool with the medicine, and insert the spoon with the wool into a tube above, until the wool adheres to the spoon.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you achieve what you wish from the cauterization of that.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it go: for it indeed dries up and falls off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the wound with wool imbued in butter, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine: and moisten with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it should be treated externally with a poultice, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore, this method of treatment is healthier than incision and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes it is cured even with that which is finer than cauterization and incision: it is cured with smoke, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamint, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sea-holly, and chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs to these: and gather all of them, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and boil: and the pot should be glazed properly, and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which is placed a concave instrument according to this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass: and the extremity, in which is the garlic, is inserted into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor ascends to the wound above the cannula, until the wound is darkened much.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times, until it dries up.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, do not make this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of abscesses.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For indeed it adds to the abscess: and it is not necessary that you should do this except at the decline of its hot abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a cannula, and place in its extremity a piece of cork: so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned: for the cork prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is from good treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	About the extraction of thorns, and bones from the mouth.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many things stick in the throat, such as a fish bone, or another thing.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you should remove what is visible on top of what falls under the view, after placing your tongue with the instrument facing the sun, and it is declared to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you should make a weak emetic before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the weak person will swallow a piece of bread, or the root of lettuce, or a dry crust of bread: or he will receive a piece of sponge sea, and tie it with a thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it has reached the place where the bones, or the bone, are, and is removed, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we said: then use the tool from lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the Radius a little, and at the end of it there is a narrowness, which he can insert into his throat with ease: and he himself has his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And beware of touching his epiglottis, so that it does not happen to him cough, and he pushes with it the bone, or the fish bone, or inserts it himself with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the weak person inserts, this is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and he pushes down, or he draws his hand with the instrument upwards, all that according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	¶ Of the extraction of a leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When treating a bleeding wound with the method I mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not stop, then consider placing the injured person in front of the sun, or near the sun after applying the instrument I told you about to their tongue.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the bleeding wound, remove it with a small spoon, or with a fine instrument gently.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with those, then take a hollow needle and insert it into the throat of the injured person until near the throat: then insert the heated iron into the hollow of the needle with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this frequently: and let the injured person avoid all water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him receive a full glass of cold water and open his mouth in it: and cover his mouth with it, and not swallow any from it: and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the bleeding wound immediately when it feels the water falls.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not leave with what we told you, then smoke the injured person with cimices, or with asafetida with the instrument I told you about in the smoking of the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this frequently, for it will fall itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in smoking is, that you take a pot in which there are live prunes with fire: and the pot is covered with a cover, in which there is a hole: and the instrument is placed in this hole at its end.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the smoking, and let him place his mouth in the end of the needle, and close his mouth, so that the smoking does not escape, until you know that the smoking has reached the bleeding wound.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the bloodletting will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the weak one will bear thirst, and eat salted food, and ointments, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which bloodletting is removed from the throat, when it falls on it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curve which enters the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, which has a roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Concerning the opening of pustules, and their cutting, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	Pustules are of many species, of many modes, according to which the remembrance comes of them, namely one and one in this book: and they are diverse in their piercing, and cutting of them from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is from the species of pustules in itself, and because it contains from moistures.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is because of the places, in which it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because the pustule happening in the head, is other from the pustule happening in the anus: and the pustule happening in a fleshy place, is other from the pustule happening in the joints: and to each of them is its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from the pustules are those which it is not necessary that they be pierced, unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion: and from them are those which it is necessary that they be pierced, while they are raw, and not mature according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As abscesses which are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint, and is allowed to continue, may cause the surrounding tissue to putrefy, possibly corrupting the ligaments or nerves of that joint: therefore, this is a closer cause of contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess in a principal limb: for if you delay the incision of it until it ripens, it will harm either him or through that principal limb.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, so pierce it immaturely: and it is not necessary to pierce, a raw abscess, not complete digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in the end that does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You should know the time of incision for abscesses that have ripened according to their completion: and it is at the cessation of pain, remission of fever, and diminution of redness, pulse, and sharpness of headache in abscesses: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you should do the same incision in the lower part of the abscesses, and more prominent swelling: and the incision should be longitudinal in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and the places of the backs, and chords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those that reflect, go with the incision according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to let go the incision of it until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and there are many wounds and filthiness, and perhaps its lips become hardened and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are pierced according to the width of the body at need: or according to that where the member needs it.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary for the administrator in small abscesses to make a small incision, and in large abscesses to make a wide incision: or many cuts according to the likeness of the size of the abscesses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are from abscesses, in which it is necessary for the skin to be hollowed out: and it is incised when already it is like a piece of cloth, and it has been made at the end, which is already dead: such as that which happens in many, so that they doubt, and in buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from them are those which are cut with a cut having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from it is that which is incised as the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Such as an abscess in the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from them are those in which the administration of a round cut and a crescent-shaped cut is given: and similar to them from the cuts.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	Indeed, that which has no head, such as are the mild abscesses on the surface, it is necessary for you to pierce it with a shallow incision, or a flat one only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, so that you do not rush and remove all the pus at once in that hour: indeed, remove a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then leave the abscess alone until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the gradation until it comes out, especially if the patient is weak or feeble, a pregnant woman, a small child, an old man, or a decrepit person: for the animal spirit often dissolves with the excretion of pus, and perhaps the weak one dies, and you will not notice it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, be very careful about this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your incision, by which you are piercing these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound is small or flat, then apply lint from linen, or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and there are many incisions, then you must insert lint into every incision until it reaches the bottom.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, or hollowed it out: then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is sewn, or wool is shorn without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then put it back, and care for it with what is necessary from the ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if blood flows during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked in the cloth: and put it on the place of the blood flow many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the blood flow continues, then you must apply the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have mentioned in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the time of winter, and the place of the abscesses is many nerves: then you must pour the powders with wine, and warm oil: and put them on the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer and the wounds are fleshy: then it is necessary to place moist sawdust soaked in water, or with oil, or with wine and oil, and keep everything cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we said, then it is necessary to dissolve the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer what is appropriate for its healing until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore the necessary knowledge of universal abscess healing.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Indeed, according to the method of distinction, I have already said about every abscess, how there is a way to its healing individually by chapters.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	¶ About the incision of an abscess that occurs on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur on the scalp skin, and they are of the kinds of knots, which contain the tunics that are to them sacks: as if they themselves were scratched chickens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	From them are the fat ones: and from them are those that contain moisture similar to clay: and from them are those that contain moisture similar to friable and mushy: and from them are similar ones, and from them are those that are hard like stone.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the incision of all, and their removal is not fearful, as long as it does not make opposition to the artery at their incision.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their incision is, that it is tried with an instrument, whose form comes after these, which is called Intromissus, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then dry it by incision according to the length of the surface incision: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	Begin with a section using a straight line b. to the line g. When the moisture is cleared, then scrape off the dried skin (kistin) that contains that moisture, and do not let anything remain from it completely.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times it returns if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then soak cotton in Egyptian oil, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and let it remain until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remains from the skin.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with Egyptian oil second and third, and if you need it, until you trust that nothing remains from the skin, then care for the wound with oil until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a thick knot: then dry it according to this form, with a cutting tool having the form of a cross: and insert nails between the grooves of the cut, and scrape it from all parts: and try your strength in extracting the skin that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if the artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you next.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in the stone abscess, from the cut and cure, as we said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the cut on the stone abscess is easier: because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses in the head in certain people, with whom there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is: because I cut on the abscess in the head of an old woman, and I found the abscess as a solid and hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken: and if someone hits it with it throwing, it wounds itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other head abscesses that occur, however, besides these abscesses that happen in the heads of children and around the roots of the ears, a section of all of them should be a superficial cut.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make an incision in them always from the lower part of them, so that the course of the pus may be relieved towards the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care of those with what is appropriate for their cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	¶ On the section of Strophularia in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those that occur in the neck, there is one and many: and they are generated from each other: and every Strophularia from them is within its own tunic, as it is in knots and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the species of these Strophularia are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from them indeed are stony: and from them are those which contain moistures: and from them are evil ones, which do not obey the cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that therefore which you see of good disposition from among them, whose manifest is near the color of the skin, and moves to all parts, and is not annexed with the nerves of the neck, nor with the guidegium, nor with the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary that you cut it with a superficial cut from the upper part to the lower part of the body by a line, b. by a line, g., and scrape off the skin from all parts: and extend two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we have said in abscesses of the head, and extrahe it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is an additional precaution that the vein or nerve does not get injured.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And it should be a blunt, not sharp, knife: so as not to add your hand with the incision, or disturb the weak, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein, or an artery, and it prevents you from the operation, then place in the wound some powdered zeig, or certain powders that stop bleeding, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound becomes soft: or it begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped then. So go back to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your index finger, if there remains anything from the small strophuli: so cut them, and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is a large vein in the root of the strophuli: then it is necessary not to cut that strophuli from its root: but it is necessary to tie it with doubled strong thread, and leave it until it falls off without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you have already immersed in Egyptian oil.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	But if the strophuli is cut entirely, then it is necessary to gather the two wound lips: and sew it immediately, after you see that there is no excess remaining.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is excess remaining due to the size of the strophuli, then it is necessary to extend to cutting its root, and removing it: and apply the suture as we said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And whatever from the strophuli contains moisture, pierce it with a shallow puncture: so that the place of its maturity appears to you: and place the puncture below the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	After the perforation, apply liniment with ointment and similar substances to cauterize the remaining part affected by decay until you see that the wound is clean. Then treat it with a generative ointment of flesh until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Concerning the sectioning of the epiglottis from an abscess within the throat due to an accident.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients performed this sectioning of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those who have a synanche, the sectioning of the epiglottis should be avoided, since it cannot be done through that, because all veins and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	But in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, throat, or both jaws, when there is no illness in the channel, one should use sectioning of the epiglottis to avoid the danger that occurs from prefication.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to do this, we should cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small section through its width, in that which is between two circles by quantity, which is a section in a soft place, not in cartilage: and this place is convenient for the section, because it is free from flesh, and veins are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, then one should stretch the skin of the throat with a needle.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should open the skin, until when it reaches the channel: avoid veins, if he sees anything from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the soft part that we mentioned: and it is indicated over the sectioning of the channel from phlegm that exits from it, because it is broken, and the division of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the open wound heal at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	Therefore, when the hour comes when the preformed foreskin is feared to be removed, gather the two lips of the wound and suck only the skin without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis,
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this conversation we have narrated is not an explanation unless when they see that some of these abscesses has already filled the throat of the sick person: and the sick person was lifted up over death, and he wished to be cut off from his breath: they went to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person could breathe over the wound with some breathing, and be saved from death: and for this reason they ordered the open wound to be left until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice lasts for three days, and it is as if it is itself: then they ordered the wound to be sucked and cared for until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw myself is that one maidservant took a knife, and sent it with her into her throat, and it struck with it the part of the trachea.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to heal her, and I found her groaning, as is the groaning of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Therefore I exposed the wound, and I found blood that had come out of the wound in small amount.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore I was confident that she had not cut the vein, nor the artery: and air was going out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Therefore I quickly sucked the wound and cared for it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maidservant, except a hoarse voice: and she returned after days to a better condition of her limbs.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	I advise therefore that I say: That in the cutting of the Epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	¶ On the cutting of the Hernia of the neck.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This swelling called Hernia of the neck is a large abscess according to the color of the body: and it is much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two modes: for either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one certainly there is no skill.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	But in the accidental one indeed it is according to two modes: of which one is similar to the fat knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to the abscess that is made from the knotting of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it is not necessary to make a presumption against it with iron, unless in that which is small: and you prove it, and investigate it with the intromission.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to the fat knot, and it is not suspended with any vein: then cut it, as the knots are cut: and extract it with that which contains from the chest, if it is in the chest: and if not, then examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with that which is necessary from the cure, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	¶ On the cutting of the species of Knots.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already said all the kinds of them in the division: and it is necessary that I should tell here the difference between a Knot, and an Extrusion: since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when an Extrusion is heat, and fever, and very violent pain, until the boiling over of excess is sedated, and completion of putrefaction: then indeed fever and heat are quieted.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When dealing with a wound that is not inflamed, there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it is contained within its own pus, which is a sac specific to it and corresponds to the color of the body: and its beginning is like chickpeas, and it becomes like lentils, and there are larger and smaller ones.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two kinds: either fatty: or they contain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a wound, you must try it and examine it first with the instrument called the Intromissus, according to its form as it appears in the chapter that follows.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining a wound and all wounds is as follows: you take this instrument and insert it into the moistest part that you find in the wound: and you gradually turn your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then your last hand according to the measure of the size of the wounds.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then remove the Intromissus and examine what has come out at its tip.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore it comes out running moisture, whatever the color is: then dry it with a superficial cut, as I said in the other wounds.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out at the tip of the Intromissus, then you know that it is fatty: so dry it with a cut having the form of a cross, in this form as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrape off the skin from all parts with facility: and guard the pus if you can above it, so that you can remove it along with the wound.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the pus is broken into pieces during the operation, and it is not possible to remove it whole, often this happens: then remove it piece by piece until there is nothing left of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if something remains from it, too little or too much, the knot returns according to the most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if it overcomes you and something remains from it, then fill the wound at your completion with certain corrosive powders: sharp, and bind the wound, and place above it what sits the pus hot, and care for it with the remaining cure until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	Therefore if the knot is large, then cut its two lips, and care for it with that which fleshens.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if to you the opposite vein of the pulsatilla, or not pulsatilla, then hasten, and fill the place with crushed zegi, and leave it bound for two days, or three, until the wound rots, and the boil of blood ceases: then return to cutting that which remains from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	¶ On the outside instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the shapes of introducers, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For indeed it is large, and from them it is medium, and from them it is small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of iron awl of the ends of squares properly, so that they quickly enter into the boil.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the shapes of experiencers, and not, that is, piercing: and one of them is named beris, that is, piercing: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For indeed it is large, and medium, and small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are joined, so that they investigate through them boils, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes from what is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, clean, soft, like the large awl which has seats, from citrine indeed, or from air, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better than them are those made from citrine.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And they are made from black lead, which come together so that through them they experiment with fistulas, whose concavity is reflections, so that they reflect with their own softness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from them are long, from them medium, and from them short, according to the quantity of the amplitude of the fistula and its stricture.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of Uncinates, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because from them are simple, that is, those in which is one curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are Uncinates blind: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are Uncinates having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and from them are Uncinates having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of Scalpels, by which they cut and exfoliate Nodos, and abscesses: and they are of three kinds: because from them is large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities by which the section is made are sharp, other extremities are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except that with them is made a bandage in the exfoliation of Nodos at the fear of incision of the vein, or nerve: and that the sick may be healed by it, and find some tranquility for a little from the burning which he found at the exfoliation of abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magnifying Glasses, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made from air, and they are like a Ray, with which is made alcohol: and in the broad extremity there is a hidden punctum Spatium: and in it runs to the interior and exterior when you want, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of pus that hides between the fingers, at the location of the boil opening: and the sick do not feel them, and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the wounds through which blood flow is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of air or yellow, round, slightly long, as you see: and let they be at the delicacy.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these forms of the wounds be large and small with you: so that you cut off the blood through them with speed in need, and then when there is no medicine present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	But you will not use them in the cutting of blood in every place of the body, and you will not use them except in fleshy places: as the backs of the legs, and the hips, and the backs of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar to these, from fleshy places, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made of them small instruments similar to the husks of beans, according to their form: by which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of the vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made of them round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	¶ Of the care of human breasts which resemble the breasts of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the fullness of sleep (that is, when they begin to become dirty in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and remain pustulous foully.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever dislikes this (practice), it is necessary for them to cover the breasts with a lunar incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then they should remove the skin entirely, including the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then they should fill the wound with a flesh-colored medicament.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Afterwards, gather the two edges of the wound with a suture and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the breast declines towards the lower parts and becomes soft due to its size, as often happens with women: then it is necessary to make two incisions on its upper sides, each of which contains the other at their ends, until one line containing the smaller one is formed, according to this form from line b to line g. Then they should remove the skin that is between the two lips, and take off the fat, and administer what was said about the suture and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, the incision does not hold together as it should due to the restlessness of the sick person or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary to fill the wound with a corrosive ointment immersed in cotton, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Regarding the puncturing of abscesses, which occurs under the breasts.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur under the breasts are of a type of hard strophularia, which contain kistas, and from these are those that contain moistures.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore, those that are from these that contain moistures should be dried with a lunar incision, according to this form from line b to line g, when everything that is in the abscess is drained out of pus, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the bandage and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the type of Strophularia knots, then cut it above, as we said in the section on Strophularia evenly.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If the wound extends so that it can emit pus, then apply a cauterizer to it according to what we said in the previous one.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the section of abscesses that occurs due to artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is broken and the skin that is above it is consolidated, an abscess often occurs from this: and similarly, an abscess and swelling also occur in veins.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to the artery and vein, are: because when the abscess is due to the artery, it is long, collected in the deep part of the body: and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a noise to it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to vein, is round in an obvious part of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section on this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groins, and on the neck, and in many parts of the body: and it is great and very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it must be avoided with iron in its care, and that which is from them also is at the extremities, or on the head, must be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore on that which is from them due to inflation of the artery opening, find in the skin section in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with hooks, then the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is uncovered.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert the needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place that is between the two ligaments with a lancet, until all the blood that is in it comes out and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply the treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off: then care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to the cutting of the vein, then you must hold what is possible for you to remove from the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the needle under the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread on it, until you remove it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie it with the abscess with a good ligature: according to what I told you in the ligature of the vein, from two parts with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread will be removed, then insert another needle with another thread under the abscess entirely at the incision of the needle: press and tie your thread in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in the middle of itself, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut off the excess skin, and let go what is tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place on it a compress that you dipped in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the treatment that is made with lint and ointment until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	On the abscess that happens from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as it happens that an abscess occurs in an artery and vein, similarly, an abscess can occur in nerves: this happens to them from a blow or from excessive labor, and the like. It is most common in the places of helpers, or calcanei, and in every place where the movements of the joints occur: and it is a heavy abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to that of the rest of the body, and it occurs in many positions without pain: and when it is compressed with great force, the sick person feels in it a sensation similar to paralysis.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess that is aggregated in the depth of the body, but rather it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go to the front, nor before, nor back to the rear parts.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what is from them in the joints, it is not necessary that it be approached with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps contraction will occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is from them in the head, or in the forehead, pierce the skin with a lancet.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and excise it: then remove it, and gather the wound with a stitch: and care for it until it is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	About cutting abscesses that occur in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	It often happens to some men in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, that they have warts, which are called fungous growths, by similarity with mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is thin, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned over.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And among them is little: and among them is that which is highly valued greatly.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	Indeed, I have seen a man, and in his belly were two testicles, which were more like other things than anything else: there was no difference between them, they were white, small roots, and they faced each other, and they were found, and moisture always ran from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I therefore cut them, and I found in the weight of one as if X and 8 ounces and in the other as if 6 ounces. And the operation in their cutting is that you consider then, if the sick person is wet, and the color of the testicles is white, moist, delicate roots: then cut him with a broad spatula, and there be cauterization in your presence in fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often blood is driven out of its cutting: therefore hurry if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the sick person afraid and timid from the cutting with iron, then take a thread made of lead properly, and tie with it a cloth: whose method we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the stricture of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease to tie lead, whenever it is pressed on the testicles, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without labor.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the testicles are coarse of roots, then in their cutting there is something fearful and timid: especially what is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However it is possible to cut its middle.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it, until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware that you do not presume to cut testicles which are of brown color, few senses, foul appearance: for indeed it is a cancerous abscess: and I will come with the remembrance of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Translation: On the Treatment of Umbilical Hernias.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Umbilical hernias occur for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from a tear in the abdomen, which is above the belly, and protrudes through it, or an intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from the vein, or from the artery, as was previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from the abdominal wall being too loose in that area.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it is due to a tear in the abdomen and the protrusion is through the thigh, then it has a similar color to a pustule: and it is painless, without pain: and it appears to be in different positions.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of an intestine, then its position is with that which we have mentioned, of greater diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it disappears: then it returns, and perhaps it is with that sound: and it is greatly enlarged at the entrance of the bath, and the effort is violent.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is due to moisture, it is painless, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is it compressed, nor does anything else happen.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then with these signs it appears to be a pustule turning black from the slope.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to flesh born, then it is a heavy, thick, hard pustule, and it is shaped according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if it is due to looseness, then the touch of it is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in it is, so that you consider at that time, if the umbilical hernia is due to blood from the artery, or the vein, or looseness: then it is necessary to be prevented from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that case there is fear and trembling, as I taught you in the chapter where I said about abscesses due to the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	But if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or a fistula: then you must order the sick person, as much as possible, to hold their breath and stand upright.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with the cautery around the navel of the whole body.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to lie down on his back between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then circle with a broad-bladed knife around the navel on the spot that you indicated with the cautery.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the abscess towards the upper parts, with a large needle.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him around the navel strongly with a strong thread, or with a silk cord from a strong silk ligature: and let there be a knot in the ligature.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find that it is already captured by the ligature: then remove the ligature, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen: and if you find a fistula, then take it with the needle, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if the opposite is against you, the artery or vein: then circle it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two needles into the circumference that you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make to pierce.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the abscess in four places on the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle, and let go of the place, until the extended flesh rots: and falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that (wound) with the appropriate medicine until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if the prominence of the umbilicus is from the flesh or moisture, then you should drain the abscess as we mentioned earlier.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And remove the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of that (wound) with the appropriate medicine that hardens the area.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	¶ On the treatment of Cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already mentioned the division of cancer species and how to treat it with medicines, and we must be careful with its treatment with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we said that cancer generated in the womb, and precautions for its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated, such as cancer in the breasts or thighs, and similar places located in the limbs to remove the whole of it, especially when it is small and beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	But when it is old and large, one should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not heal anyone from that: nor did I see anyone before me who reached that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we mentioned, is to go ahead and dissolve the weak part from black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then if you find blood flow with obvious fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak part with preparation, where it will be located with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then insert hooks that suit it into the cancer.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then drain it from all parts with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but express the places and wipe off the thick blood entirely by your hand, or with whatever is possible there from instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the unevenness of the blood flow due to an incision in the artery or vein bothers you, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound itself along with the other treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the Care of Hydrops.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 45.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we have already discussed the division of hydrops species, how water accumulates, and all its symptoms, as well as its treatment with remedies.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And the one that is cured with iron is only the species of ascites alone, and it does not approach with iron the species of tympanitis: nor does the species of hydrops entirely: for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already been cured of this species of hydrops tympanitis with remedies, and your treatment did not include: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient has already become weak, or there is weakness with him other than hydrops: such as if it is with him cough, or diarrhea, and similar things: then beware that you do not treat him with iron: for that is fear.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see the patient overflowing with strength, and there is no other illness with him except hydrops alone: and he is not a child, nor an old person: then the method of operation in him is, that you lift up the patient standing between your hands, and the assistant after him will press his belly with his hand pushing the water towards the lower part of the ribs.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a sponge of thistle in this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It should be two parts sharp, long, and sharp at the ends like a sponge.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there should be something of brevity gradually in it, so that you do not pass with him to the operation up to the intestine, and you do not hurt it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of Hydropisis is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary to extend with a cut from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, to the lower parts in a straight line above the pecten.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of Hydropisis is due to pain in the liver, then your cut should be on the left side from the navel by the quantity of three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of Hydropisis is due to the spleen, then your cut should be on the right side: and it is not necessary either that the cut should be in the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not flow to that weaker place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument through the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that cut, and introduce your hand with a spatula between the skin and the flesh, as if you are scraping it: and let the quantity which excoriates be the quantity of a nail, or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the flesh until the spatula reaches the empty place: and there is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the hole an instrument of which this is the form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or of brass, or of gold, light, clean: in its lower part there is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: and it has an incised tip, according to the mode of incision of a pen, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately flows down over the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in the middle of the hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in the hour by the resolution of his animal spirit: or he suffers from syncopes which approach death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	However, you should draw out from it according to the amount of its virtue, and according to what the positions of the sick person signify to you through its power, and through its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then draw out the instrument, and hold the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it will be retained immediately due to the skin that holds the opening which is above the siphon: of which I have spoken, so that you can pierce it in the same way.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the second day, if you see the sick person bearing that: and also draw out from the water a small quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this on several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains in the water only a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the sick person, and let out much from the water: then care for him with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in the bath and sun, and wait for thirst: and care for him with dry medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize on his stomach, and epar, and spleen, after extraction of the water: according to what I have spoken in that which preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	¶ On the care of children who are born in places where their urinary openings are not pierced.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone of the children leaves from the womb of his mother, and the head of his mother is not pierced, or the opening is narrow, or in not its place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore you must assist with the piercing of it immediately when he is born with a small and very sharp knife, in this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place in the opening a thin lead clamp, and tie it: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wants to urinate, remove it, and mix.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it again.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead, it is already possible that the urine that flows over the place does not allow it to become obstructed.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose fistula is narrow, he is treated with lead, as we said, for many days until it becomes wider.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those in whom the fistula is not in its proper place, they are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because from those who are born, the fistula is at the end of the head of the maiden: therefore she cannot urinate towards the front, until she raises the maiden's staff to the upper parts with her hand.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation for her, because the semen cannot reach the matrix according to straightness: and it is a very shameful illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in him is that the weak one lies face down on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the maiden with your left hand by forceful extension, and cut the head of the maiden from the place of the penis, with a sharp point, or a narrow knife: as is the incision of a pen, or as you cut something, so that the middle of it comes to the head of the maiden: and so that the fistula falls in the middle according to what is proper.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of you during your operation from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore place it with that which cuts the blood, and care for the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	¶ Of the white things that occur in the prepuce and head of the maiden, and corruption, blackness, and adherence.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Often these white things occur in the maiden, and it is a disgusting flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it another is a malignant one, and another is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, you should hang the non-malignant one with a fine needle, and cut it off until you cleanse it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place on it a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian oil.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself after that with Dyafinicon oil until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the Albather is malignant and has a foul color, then you should apply a cautery after its incision and its scraping.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If the Albather is inside the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and it is a part of the Albather inside the foreskin and a part outside: then you should remove the Albather that is inside first, until it consolidates, then care for it externally: because if you care for it simultaneously, the foreskin will not be secure and will protrude.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now even in the testicles, blackness and corruption occur.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should cauterize the entire thing that has already blackened and what wants to become corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then place a line on it after that with honey that has been beaten with flour of poppy seeds and crumbled bread, and ground herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however bleeding occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cauterizer, in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cautery is a lancet with two positions at once, namely for bleeding and wounds when they are corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If it gnaws the head of a virgin and destroys everything in an hour: then you should insert a cannula into the opening of the penis with lead, so that the weak one may drip on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In adherence of the prepuce to the head of a virgin, and indeed this adherence does not occur unless in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required over it: and sometimes adherence occurs due to a wound, or abscess: therefore it is necessary to scrape it with a sharp spatula, until the ligament is dissolved, and the head of the virgin is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish this precisely, then it is necessary to scrape something from the head of the virgin and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	Because the prepuce, when it is thin, perhaps is pierced due to its thinness quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the prepuce and the head of the virgin with a fine linen cloth, which is already made into water cold, so that they do not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated with styptic wine, until it is hardened.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of them from error that happens to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not the dissolution of continuity, like other wounds: but since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we mark in this operation a better sign, and a path leading more easily to salvation.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not say circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired by experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Because I have found the majority of artisans, and phlebotomists to use cleansing by circumcising with a scalpel, and with forceps: and they use those who are affected, and ligaudo with thread, and incision with a needle.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	I myself have already tested all these methods, and I have not found a better method of cleaning with tweezers and tying with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Since often the skin escapes when cleaning with a scalpel.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the skin of the prepuce has two layers, perhaps the upper skin was cut and the lower layer was exposed, therefore it is necessary to make another incision and cause future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleaning that is done by touching, that is, digitally, as surgeons use, the incision of the extreme member of the male body is not secured, since perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in cleaning with a spoon, perhaps the iron escaped and ruined your operation, and the skin of the child is short by nature, and often they are born like that, which does not need cleaning, and I have already seen it.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, in cleaning with tweezers and tying with thread, a good experiment has shown to me, because the tweezers are proportional to the incision, therefore, since the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you place your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional and they incise according to one operation at one time, and a compression of similar figure is made, containing the skin of the virgin from all parts with which there is no error at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of your operation is that you make an estimate, especially a child, if it is from those who understand a little, which you do not do except that you tie thread in its own virgin, and leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him enjoy and be happy in every way possible to you from that which he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and not sit: and hide the needles in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child does not see them at all, nor anything from the tools.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his sleeve, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the sleeve comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it from what gathers in its dirtiness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked spot with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie it below that with a small piece of thread.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the spot of the lower tie, and good retention, and cut between the two ties.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin quickly upwards, and extract the head of the sleeve.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros. Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better) and place powder on top: and above the powder a cloth in which the expanded gut was boiled in rosewater, shaken with rose oil. Recently good: and let him lie on top of it until another day: and care for the rest of his healing, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	But the form of the needle for cleaning is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	They should be sharp two ends, and they should be incidents: so that the branch of the claw does not stick out in them: and the length of the two needles is like the length of two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But the mistake that occurs in cleaning is: because perhaps the inner skin is completely escaped, or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary, that you extend it from your hour with your nail before the formation of the pus at the spot: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold her with your nail, then remove her with a hook and cut her.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if more than three days have passed and what remains under the probe is inflated, it is an abscess: then let it go until the abscess becomes hot and you scrape it with some ointment, and cut it according to what is prepared for you, and beware of the tip of the probe.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm her.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore care for it with the powder that we mentioned in the treatise on powders, and if it cuts through the skin above the measure and goes to the upper part, it does not harm her either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore care for it with what we said until she is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	¶ On the extraction of a stone retained in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Urinary retention in the bladder is caused by a blockage made from stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh-like matter, and similar things from those that we mentioned as cures in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the stone does not dissolve and you see that the retention is due to the stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary for him to be lying on his knees and cared for.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet will be placed on his back, and he will extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and tie his short breath as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, with the neck of the bladder towards the stone's expulsion, it is dissolved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it does not dissolve with what we said and the matter is strong on the weak one, then it is necessary for the extractor of the stone with an instrument called a siringa, whose form is made of silver, and is thin, light, concave like the cannula of a bird's quill in subtility of the radius, long in the likeness of the palm of one and half hands: and it has a thin cannula in its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	The method of extracting a splinter using this instrument is as follows: take a doubled thread and tie a good ligature at its end, either with wool or cotton. Then insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the forceps and, if there is any excess lint, cut it off with scissors. However, if there is no excess lint, insert the thread into the cannula with force, as previously mentioned.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then apply the forceps with oil, either with butter or with white of egg: and make the invalid sit on the seat, and rub the perineum, and the forceps itself with wet oils, and oil of olives, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the forceps into the splinter with ease until it reaches the root of the splinter.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it back from the upper part near the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the forceps into it until it reaches the bladder, and the invalid feels that it has reached an empty space: and this is not done in this order unless the passage through which it goes is where there is a bend.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then gradually extend the thread with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the splinter will follow the lint.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then remove it and make the splinter run through the urinary passage: and repeat the forceps, and do not stop doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the invalid finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Regarding the quality of the discharge from the bladder with Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 65.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer or blood clots in the bladder, or pus is confined in it and fluids and medicines wish to distill into it: then make use of an instrument called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is called deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, where that which impels is, should be according to the quantity that it will push it without addition until when it is drawn with it something, from moistures is attracted: and when it is impelled, with it is expelled far: as does the clepsydra, by which is thrown naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you want to throw moistures into the bladder, insert the extremity of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with it that which impels to the upper parts, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its extremity into the reed, as we told in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then impel the moisture with that which impels, for indeed that moisture has come to the bladder immediately, so that it feels it weak.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a syringe by which the bladder is catheterized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or gold: whose head higher is like a little camel, and under it a pouch in which the string falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a sheep, and put in it the moisture, by which you want to catheterize the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two pouches with a strong rope and double thread: and heat the moisture a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the extremity of the syringe into the reed, afterwards tighten your hand on the bladder with moisture with a decent stopper, until it feels weak, that that moisture has already come to the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it completely to remove all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread through those holes, as they are turned.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, like an apothecary: after you place in it what you want from moistures, oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it with an instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder from the expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	Now we have spoken about the division of the species of stone, and its cure with medicines: and I said the difference between a stone formed in the kidneys, and the bladder, and its signs throughout: and I said about the operation of a stone that falls into the hand and cutting: and that is a stone that is actually formed in the bladder: and that which is shaped in a reed: and I am narrating that with clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that a stone formed in the bladder, most often happens to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is that urine exits from the bladder like water in its fineness: and appears in it sand white, and he rubs his reed weakly, and struggles with it, and often hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then he rises up, and exits with it the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is easy to cure children, from which they follow until fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young people it is medium, in that which is between them: and of him whose stone is larger, cure is easier: and if small, is opposite his cure.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we arrive at the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with a clyster, which draws out all the feces that are in his intestines: for this, when neglected, sometimes prevents the discovery of the Stone in an examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the sick person should be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved towards the lower parts: so that the Stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or leap from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands be under his buttocks, so that the bladder may become entirely inclined towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then feel for it, and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the Stone in the space, then hasten immediately with a lancet above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not at all come under your touch, then you must wipe the index finger with oil from your left hand, if the sick person is a child: or the middle finger if he is an adult complete: and introduce it into his anus, and search for the Stone, until it comes under your finger: and turn him gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and push it towards the outside against the place of which you wish to make an incision: and command the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand towards the upper part: and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part from which the incision is to be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce a lancet with the following shape:
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it that is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be on it above the Stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that it may be an external incision wide, and an internal one narrow, according to the quantity which is possible for the egress of the Stone from it not greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed he compresses the finger, which is in the anus, a stone at the incision, and exits without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you should know that because of the stone, which has angles and edges, it makes difficult exit for it.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from this, it is smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is made easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, to him who has angles and edges, add in the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If he does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you use ingenuity above him: or tie over him with a belt properly, whose extremity is like the moon, which ties over the stone, and does not slip from it: or that you insert under him a thin instrument, curved at its extremity.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot do so above with it, then widen the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something binds you from the blood, cut it off with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if the stone is more than one, then push the first large into the opening of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a little after that: and likewise do if there are many two by two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	But if it is very large, then it is a matter of ignorance to separate above it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because it happens to the weak of two things, either that he dies, or that it happens to him frequent dripping of urine: because the place is not at all consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it exits: or use ingenuity in its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	Then when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with thyme, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place on top of it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the abscess remains hot.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then place the patient on their back, and do not untie the ligament until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you finally untie it, apply heat to the area with plenty of water and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with Dyafinicon ointment and Basilicon ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if a pus-filled abscess occurs in the wound, and it is hot, corrosive, and similar: such as when blood congeals in the bladder, and urination is prevented from it: and this is known by the discharge of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound and remove the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it will cause decay of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply everything that is suitable for its healing until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the entire period of healing, to bind two legs and bandages, cause of the medicines that are placed on the area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	But if the stone is small and it is in the passage of a virgin, and it is stuck in it, and prevents urination: then care for it with what I have told you before you reach the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For often you will be saved from the section by this treatment, for indeed I have proven it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take the Perforator from iron alferico, whose form is triangular at the end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the iron perforator into the wood with ease, until the Perforator reaches the stone: and turn the Perforator in your hand on it gradually: and try to make its puncture, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine is immediately discharged.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand against what remains on the stone from the outer part of the wall.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For indeed it is broken and goes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If, however, this cure is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from that: then tie a string under the stone, and another string above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry on the stone in the very wall between the two strings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards dissolve the string, and clean the clotted blood that is formed in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the string under the stone unless it does not return to the bladder: and the other string above, unless when the string is dissolved after the stone comes out, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to raise the skin when you tie the string above, so that it returns to your complement, and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Chapter on the Extraction of Stones from Women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The stone is not formed much in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if it happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is prevented by many ways.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who conceals herself from the doctor when she is chaste, or from those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: therefore it requires deep incision, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity calls for it, then you should take a woman doctor who is well-versed in medicine, as they are rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	However, if you cannot find such a woman, then seek out a chaste, wise, and present female obstetrician who is well-versed in the art of women's health: make her present, and especially her, to do everything you instruct her to do based on your examination.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, it is necessary for her to examine if the woman is a virgin: then she should insert her finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she finds it, then she should cover it with her finger and then instruct the obstetrician to insert her finger into the weak vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and gently compressing it.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If she finds the stone, then she should gradually move it from the bladder opening downwards with great skill until she reaches it at the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should cover it over the weak vagina at the root of the thigh, from whichever side she prepares herself and feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, covering it underneath: and let the incision be small in the first place.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should insert the radium over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If she then feels the stone, then she should add to the incision a corresponding amount of radium according to the size of the stone that is being expelled from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these, one is small and large, gentle and rough, long and round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore know its kind, as it is signified to you by this above what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore it convinces you blood, then add in the place of the wound ground cumin, and hold it for an hour until the blood is separated.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and make, that you prepare with you from the tools which I said in the extraction of the stone in the men, so that you help through those in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	But if it convinces you bloody flux, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which is cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with bandages with a proper binding: and do not move it: and let go the stone, and do not take it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	But when the sharpness of the blood is calmed after days, and the place rots, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	¶ On the cutting of the hydrocele.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	Hydrocele is not, unless the accumulation of moisture in the white bag under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called a sac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own pouch, which nature has prepared for itself in the part of the eye, until it is thought to be: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white bag, which we said: and it is not made except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this hydrocele is indeed from the weakness which happens to the testicles: therefore this matter is poured out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from the blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	This moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For its color is inclined towards yellowishness, or it is red with blood, or filthy, black, or it is watery white, and that is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the back white which we said, then the abscess is round to the length somewhat like the figure of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every part.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own proper cloth, then the abscess is round with part of an egg, and therefore the man estimates it because it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white back, then it falls under sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore when you want to know the color of the moisture, then try the color of the moisture in the abscess with the square inserter, whose form precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that which goes out in the heel of the inserter, judge of that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the cure with iron, then it is necessary for you to command the sick one, that he be bled if possible, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let him lie on his back on a high bed slightly, and put under him many cloths.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then you sit on his left, and command the servant, that he sit on his right, who extends his rod to one of two skin of the testicles, and to the part of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then you take a broad spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle in length, until near the pecten: and make the cut according to the rectitude of the line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it arrives at the white back comprehending: and scrape him and observe, or caution from this, that you scrape him: and your scraping is from the part which hangs with an egg more: and subtly scrutinize with the scraping according to the quantity which is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the siph with a wide hole and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the cut with hooks and extend the siph to the upper part, but do not touch the skin that encloses the testicles: and incise the siph however it is possible for you to incise it, or entirely, or in pieces, especially the thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine, there is no safety in the incision, lest the water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if it proceeds outwards from its own skin at the time of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the siph, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as the other wounds, until it is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if you find something corrupted from another stain, then it is necessary to bind wounds, which are the support, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its support, and draw out the thing: afterwards care for it with what we said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if the water is gathered in two parts, then you will know that there are two branches: therefore cut off the other part according to what you did in the other equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, that the operation be one, then do: afterwards wipe off the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert in the incisions a wool soaked in oil, or in rose-tinted oil: and place another wool than you immersed in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and on the belly: and place double cloths above, and they are pads: and bind them above with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, wash and fill them with red-dyed wool, according to this likeness: and make their ends that which is pressed from the belly, or wet wool: and gather them together with a band in the loins of the animals: and one end takes over the anus up to the back, and the second takes to the part of the beak: and two ends above two hips, and two ends another on two groins, and gather the whole band in the loins of the animals.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this incision is artificially medicated with a cautery at the place of the cut with iron: and it is, that you take a thin scalpel as a cautery, and scrape with it the skin of the testicles: and it is burned, according to what we have told: until when it detaches the white containing water: then take the scalpel, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The letter Greek is similar.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that white, and it is burned, until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the white with hooks, and scrape with a thin burning cautery, and cut it according to what is possible to you, until you remove all of its roots.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware from egg, lest it touch the fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and farther from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if contradiction makes you in the hour of the cut, or in the hour of the burning abscess hot, or flow of blood, or anything else: then it is necessary that you cure what contradiction makes you from that with the cure which belongs to it, according to what was premissed.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If however the patient is timid and does not anticipate this operation due to its horror: then perform the incision as I have described it, and it is done.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certified about the significations we mentioned regarding the watery ramex: then you must make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then incise the abscess in its lower part with a broad-bladed knife: and place the incision along the length of the body, and let it be wide enough for all the water to run out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place it on a clean cloth, and bandage it, and let it run off the remaining water: then care for it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however there is resistance to the escape of water at the time you are incising it: and this is not because of any other reason, but because a white cloth causes resistance in the wound opening, and prevents the exit of water: then you must insert a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which water from hydrocele is extracted, whose shape has been mentioned before: or add to the operation of the wound for a short time.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or about that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it accumulates again, then incise it in the same manner, and the sick person will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	¶ On the care of fleshy ramexes.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the incision for this ramex, there is often a lot of danger due to fear.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its removal can be saved from this.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation in it, and the appearance of abscesses.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies of men, from which the testicles are composed; and this happens for many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	either from an excessive sharpness or sharpness, which is poured out towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and there is no pain found in it; and it is a heavy abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sense in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is caused by the knotting of the arteries and their inflation; as has already been mentioned: or from the inflation of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, what is caused by those from the inflation of the arteries, is known by the arrangement of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary to touch it entirely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But that which is caused by the inflation of the veins, does not spread out from it anything at all with compression with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a cut is made on this kind of form, and on the remaining flesh; and it is to separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the thing upwards, and remove it with a white rag; and free the suspender from the vessel, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspender after you have freed it from all parts from the parts of it.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the thing is consolidated with those fleshy things, then it is necessary to draw the thing, and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between anything from the rag, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary to free the whole of that adhesion, and cut it with a round cut.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If, however, the birth of flesh is in a place of adhesion which is posterior, then it is necessary to cut off the whole of it and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When, therefore, your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose-scented oil and wine, and then care for it along with the other cure until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	About the care of Ramecis, which is with Vitum.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	There is an abscess wrapped in a certain wrapping, similar to a boil, with the softening of the testicles: and it is difficult for a weak motion and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness there is from fear, because of that which preceded its remembrance.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary for us to say the operation in it according to what they did first.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore that you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the testicle support towards the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the vases which are near the maiden: and another servant should hold them and extend them with strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a flat broad sharp crosswise section through the vases, until the vases are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape off from all parts, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in them a needle in which is the double thread, and tie it in the first place where the Vites occur: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in the middle straight section according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the humid and corrupted foulness.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound with the healing of the other wounds, in which there is a desire to generate soundness, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not an evil through that one.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the grape occurs in all the vessels, then it is necessary that they be removed because of this testicle with the vessels: so that it does not lose nourishment, for the incision, and it rots or dries out, and it is not a benefit with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	¶ On the care of the ram's intestines.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The event of this ram's intestines is from the cutting that occurs in the sifach extended over the belly in the part of the inguinal from the mirach of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sifach or from the extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis. Aut ex percussione. Aut saltu. Aut clamore. Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two species occur from many causes. Or from impact. Or from jumping. Or from shouting. Or from the heavy lifting of things and similar.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the extension of the sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that it happens gradually over a long time, and it does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal in width and depth: therefore, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from the cutting of the sifach, because it causes to happen from the beginning of its severe pain suddenly: and it is an abscess different, appearing under the skin near: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of it to the exterior of the sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it exits with the mesentery: and this is called the mesenteric intestine, and mesocele: and sometimes it forms with ventosity.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs into the intestine feces, and it is retained there: and it is with it a sign of weakness: because it causes a dull pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this disease's symptoms with iron, there is fear: therefore it is necessary to avoid that case in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the mode of operation is, that you command the weak one, so that he brings the intestine with his own hand to the interiors of its concavities, if it obeys returning.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it will lie down on its neck between your hands: and raise its legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and dry the skin of the testicles completely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix two hooks in the lips of the cut, according to what you need to open the cut with them: and the cut should be according to the amount, that it is possible, so that an egg comes out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when it is detached the white siphak hard from all parts: then insert your finger index in that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second siphak, and finish with it the adherence that is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the interiors of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white siphak upwards, with your left hand: and raise the egg with the siphak to the part of the cut: and command the minister, that he extends the egg upwards: and you solve the adherence, that is in the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And examine your fingers, so that there is nothing wrapped inside the uninvolved intestine in a hard white sihah.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find something from it, then push it down to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, in which there is a thick thread made of linen from ten threads: and insert it among the last sihah, that is, the skin that follows the incision of the testicles: then cut off the ends that protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them on top of some with the figure that is in the form of a cross: and tie them with alsifach, which we mentioned, because it is under the skin of the testicles by a strong ligament, so that nothing from the vessels that nourish them can send anything to them: so that no hot abscess arises from it.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again the second ligament beyond the first ligament, farther than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments, leave from the sihah that is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equal to the size of a finger: and cut off the rest of it all according to its roundness, and take out the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut off the lower part of the skin of the testicles by the incision from which blood and pus flowed: as we mentioned in the one that was previously mentioned.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wet gauze to the oil, and place it on the wound: and apply the ligament that we mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when sometimes the white sihah that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, to prevent the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligament until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, the event is delayed, then it should be rubbed with hot water and the remedy we mentioned should be placed on it until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound along with other wound care, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning the soft splint.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this soft splint, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first said that it is made as we mentioned in the splint which is with vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is, to apply strips of cloth after the cut on it with ease below: then dry in the middle, and care for it finally with what opens it, until the strips fall off: and care for the wound, as we mentioned, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the disruption that occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When rupture occurs in the groins, as we mentioned, and the location stands out, and nothing from the intestines descends below the testicles: and if something does descend, it is little, and it returns in all hours: but if that time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that occurs from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groins, as we mentioned.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is, because the sifach is extended: then it is softened, and the location swells, and stands out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with cauterization, as its previous account mentioned.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with iron, in this manner: and it is, that the sick person lies on their back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the location of the swollen and standing out rupture, with cutting across its width, according to the amount of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tie the alsifa and, which are under the skin, until when it is detached the white sifah under the following skin.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the ray, and place it on the elevated place from the sifah, and press it deep into the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then tie two elevated places on the end of the ray from the sifah, and connect one of them with the other by a stitch: then remove the end of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alsifa at all, nor tie anything, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the cure of the intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then care for that with the healing of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the thread, clean it, and restore the wound until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the sisach contracts, and no elevation of rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place: for it is closer to safety.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in many men, because the flesh which is between them is softened, and it defiles its appearance.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked about its cure to make the sick person lie on his back, and cut off the whole skin which has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he should sew together two lips with a stitch: and if you wish, sew in the first place three or four stitches of the skin which has been softened, and a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the healing of the remaining wounds until it is healed, and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	Of Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and because of this, it was permitted for me not to remember it in my book; and the remembrance of it is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One reason is that there should be this in the knowledge of a physician when he is questioned about it; and so that he knows its cure for him who has been harmed by it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals, for our uses through it, such as oxen, horses, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Either by abrasion.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by a cut and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	But in that which is done by abrasion, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water until the testicles become softened and soothed, and hang down: then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in castration by a cut and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspender, and cut over all of it with one cut, until when the two eggs proceed: then cut them after you have scraped each, and do not leave on them any excision except the fine sifac, which is on the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by abrasion: because abrasion perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then cure the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	The care of Hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodites are of men according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in him that follows the space, or on the skin of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which are hairs: and sometimes urine runs from that which is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one species, and it is a woman's vulva above the nipple like small male testicles projecting to the outside: of which one is like a man's priapism, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three species, two from men and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut flesh added, until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for those with the treatment of the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine exits, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is its treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	The cutting of the tenting and flesh projecting in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Perhaps tenting is added over the natural thing, until it is defiled and becomes an ugly aspect of it: and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much, that it expands like in men, and reaches up to sexual intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore you must hold the excess of the tenting by hand, or with a comb, and cut: and do not end in the incision, especially at the deep root: so that there does not occur blood flow.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with the treatment of the wounds, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	When the flesh is formed, it is the flesh that is born in the opening of the mother's womb until it fills it up; and perhaps it may have gone out to the exterior parts according to the likeness of a tail: and because of this some of the first name it as an illness called "caudata".
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore we must treat it as we would treat the Prolapse, and cure it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of Alratica, which is a wound in a woman who has not been pierced.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is a wound in a woman who has not been pierced, or has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is due to the illness that preceded it, and this is caused by flesh added, or thin chaff, or thick: and it is formed in the deep womb, or on its sides, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it prevents coition and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of this is gained by the sight of the midwife, if the opening is visible near at hand.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not visible, then seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the opening is due to thin chaff, and is near two lips: then hurry, and tear it open.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And you should place a sponge on top of the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands at once, and the woman should be on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with force, until the thin chaff is torn and the opening is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman apply it every day, so that the wound does not harden again with another substance.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the suppurating wound is thick and full of pus, then it is necessary to separate it with a broad, flat leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the suppuration is from flesh born, then suspend it with needles, and cut it: and let there be medicines with you that sedate the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thistle aggregated with whiting.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide tube of lead, so that the wound does not harden quickly, hold it for several days: and then administer linen made of dry linen, and then care for the rest of the healing until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes the birth of flesh from other wounds will occur: therefore it is necessary to cut them according to this method: since there is no carcinomatous suppuration in carcinomatous suppuration which is in the womb, there should be no contradiction with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in wounds of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the veins, until blood flows from them frequently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids are suppressed, they become red: and I have already said in the division of their species, and signs of them: and I will say here what receives healing from them, and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I therefore say, that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to sense: then there is no healing with iron for it.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	These among them which are on the opening of the womb above which falls the sense, are those which are treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the thread with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder them on the flow of blood from one powdered piece without biting: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and turpentine, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then lay her down in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and the husks of beans, and of roses, and similar.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is cut off with it, good: and if not, make wings to stick to her back, and breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and dip it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossae, or the juice of the branches of the alaulat, that is, aglanter, with sea-water, and make it stick to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then when the abscess rests, then care for the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	But Albarth red is similar to the heads of alhase, and is rough in appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said in the lilth equally: and care for it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	¶ About the perforation of the rupture which happens in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Chapter LXXIV.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	I have already spoken of all these afflictions and their symptoms, and the signs of each, and their cures in division. Now I must speak of hot abscesses which occur in the womb when there are abscesses that gather around healthy flesh, and you wish to know how its opening is made with a knife.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you must consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with impact, heat, and fever: and you see it reddening: if it falls upon it, then do not rush with its puncture: and care for it with it that it may help to ripen it until when it rests, the sharpness of the accidents.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then you must make her sit on a seat that dampens two seats, and she leans back, or is placed on her back, and brings her feet to the lower part of her belly: and her hips are spread, and she places her arms under her thighs, and ties both suitable bands.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument that opens the womb's opening.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And you must when you wish to administer this instrument, that you form with a probe deep into the woman's womb: so that it is not what enters from the instrument more than deep into the womb, and wounds the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is greater than deep into the womb, then you must place cotton on the roof of deep into the womb: so that the entrance of the instrument entirely into the womb is prevented: and you must place a revolving wheel, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and he holds the instrument, and turns the minister revolving wheel, until the deep into the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When it appears that the Exitura is ready and is touched by hand, and is soft and malleable, then it is necessary to separate it from its head with a broad-bladed knife.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the pus has been drained, then it is necessary to place a piece of linen soaked in rose-scented oil or green oil, which has some hemostatic properties, under the wound: and place the linen, and extract the section in deep into the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place it on top of the matrix, and on top of the clean linen soaked in water in which the wounds are bathed.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with ointment that is suitable for that, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the matrix and wound are washed, so that it is cleaned with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily or long-leaved aristolochia is boiled: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to be restrained from its treatment with iron, but treat it with what we said in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	¶ The teaching of obstetrics, how to treat fetuses that are born alive but not in the natural form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the natural form of birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From its signs, therefore, it is known that when you see a woman being compressed towards the lower parts, and desires to smell the air, and is relieved on top of her which is above her of birth, and hastens the exit of the fetus: then know that this birth is in the natural form, and its exit is on its head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress his belly, so that the embryo may quickly descend.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has descended upon its head, the afterbirth also descends with it, and is cleansed of those excessive substances by a good cleaning.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But whoever is beyond this birth, is unnatural, blameworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus is born with its legs first, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head is born and one of its hands: or its belly is born: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar things from those blameworthy figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise, subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception for herself: and I am showing every figure from them, and how its nature is in that, and how it is signified by it, and what it stands upon.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus is born with its head first, and its birth becomes forceful, and difficult for her, and you see that its strength has already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and vapor rises from her mouth with fenugreek decoction, and with wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife inserts a little spatula between her fingers, and wipes off the afterbirth with it, and covers it with her nail, until what is in it from the moisture has passed: and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	But if it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be cleansed from the mucilage with fenugreek, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then instruct him to stand behind the curtain, so as to be compressed: and make him sneeze with the conditioned powder, holding his nose and his own nose at the same time.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If both hands of the fetus come out first, you should gradually return them with a loop.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat, and lift her feet upwards: then shake the seat on the ground: and hold the woman, so that she does not fall with the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	Therefore if the hands do not come out and the fetus dies: then cut them off, and extract the remaining fetus: and tie its hand with a cloth, and extract it with equality: for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo is on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards: then turn the fetus gradually: afterwards equal it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet, and stretch it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	Therefore when they come out up to the hips, then instruct him to be compressed, and make her sneeze with the conditioned powder: it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have told you, then return the fetus gradually, until you place it according to its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will come out then with easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is prevented from coming out with all that we have told you: then take from the mucilage of aloe, and oil of sisaminum, and melted gum: and beat all in a mortar with good pounding: then draw a line with it on the woman's belly, and below her abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she has an emission of hypocondria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that her lower parts are already warmed up, then make her a poultice of myrrh and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore she holds the poultice for one hour, then make her sit on a stool.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and squeeze her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of her belly with gentle compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the evil will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the foetus on her knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this form, then she should gradually insert her fingers inside.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie on her back, and her feet should hang down to the lower parts: and she should be lying on the bed, and fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gently on her belly gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the foetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them with violent motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press gently on what is above the hypocondria gradually, until the foetus comes up to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then she should insert her fingers and equalize the foetus gradually: and tell the woman to press herself until the foetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the foetus hanging laterally from her hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	She should gradually reduce her fingers.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot reduce them, then lift up the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If indeed she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with violent motion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment that you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she receives the part, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in reducing the hand, and equal the child according to the natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to press herself until she exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the child over its neck, with expanded hands, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife should hold the hand of the child, then gradually turn it and equal it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When therefore it is equalized, then place on its mouth what we mentioned from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When therefore you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to press: and make her sneeze with the prepared [remedy].
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared child on its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the mother's opening according to this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is emptied of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it hangs on the face of the child and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the child to its insides, until you place it according to what is proper: and instruct the woman to press herself several times: for indeed she will exit lightly at the exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or of many children.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born: and sometimes they are born three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is indeed foreign and rarely occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five things are indeed extraordinary and do not live completely: and they contain them, although they multiply, with one egg: and they separate by scissors, distinguishing between them, tied in the navel of each of theirs.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out as one fetus exits naturally and easily, and they come out by an unfavorable exit, as we have mentioned.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult to deliver and reach what we mentioned from unnatural figures, then they should be treated as we have mentioned: and let the skilled midwife do what she does with ease and difficulty, and fit according to every figure with that which is prepared for her by the leading one towards salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remembering what is formed in the womb from embryos, and they are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has already been verified to me that a woman aborting gave birth to seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, this whole thing should be in the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will reach her like that one: therefore let her have with her what is necessary to oppose it
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	About the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are caring for a dead fetus with that which I said in the division by medication, and it does not come out, and you must use an operation with your hand, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of the accidents from which there is fear of her loss: then it is necessary that the woman be placed on a bed, on her back, and her head be inclined downwards, and her legs be raised: and let the minister hold her from two sides, or let her be tied to the bed, so that her body not be drawn out during extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the mother with warm oils mixed with a thick decoction of marshmallow root, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and decoctions: then she should insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her seek with her the place where she can hook nails from the fetus, and convenient places near it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore then, if the fetus is prepared to descend on its head: then hook nails into its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its ribs, or in nearby hypogastric regions.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is on its feet, then in its foot, and in its ribs in the middle.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place the curve of it between the fingers of her left hand: and insert it with ease into one of those places we mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then let her hook another nail, or a third if necessary, so that the contraction be equal, and not incline to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with equal extension, and not extended only along a straight line, but moved to all parts, so that her exit is eased: as is done with the tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that which is between them, that the extension be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	But if a part is retained from it, then the midwife must apply some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, in order to turn that which is retained with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus exits, then they should exchange the forceps to another place which is higher: do this until the entire fetus exits.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore a hand exits before another, and it is not possible to reduce it, due to its tightness: then it is necessary to wrap a cloth over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until when it exits entirely, cut it at the joint of the foot, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary to do in the other hand, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the fetus's head is large, or tightness occurs to it at the exit, or there is water accumulated in its head: then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a sharp spatula, and press with it the head, and extract the water: or break it with an instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly he must do if the fetus is of large head by nature, then it is necessary to cut through the skull: or extract it with a misdach, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	But if the head exits and is tightened at the fork: then press until the moisture that is in the chest flows out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it does not twist, nor obey at the exit: then cut the head in pieces, as much as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	But if there is an abscess below the belly, or there is water in it: then it is necessary to pierce it, until the moisture flows out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the fetus is above its feet, then its attraction is easy and its direction towards the mother's bone is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is restrained near the belly or chest: then it is necessary to remove it with the cloth that you have wrapped around your hand: and wipe the belly or chest until what is in them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the other limbs are removed and the head remains: then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	Therefore if the mother's bone is open, then she should insert her hand into the depth of the mother's bone and seek with it the head and draw it with her fingers up to the mother's bone: then she should insert a hook or two hooks into it and draw it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	But if the mother's bone is closed, due to an abscess that has occurred to her: then it is not necessary for her to labor over it, but rather it is necessary at that time to administer a decoction of wet things, fat: and administer ointments: and she should sit in waters that will soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize: then what we said about the living fetus will be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	But if it is not possible, then it is cut in pieces and removed.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not dismiss anything from the secondina entirely inside.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses that occur in the bellies.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	But if bleeding occurs, then it should descend into stopping waters and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have seen a woman in whose belly a dead fetus was: then she became pregnant over it with another, afterwards the other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred on his belly button, it swelled up until it burst open, and then he began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called to treat him, and I treated him for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore, I placed strong attractive plasters on him, and the bone came out of its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed by, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore surprised since the bone is not in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	Therefore, I thought that they were bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore examined the wound, and I extracted many bones while the woman was in better health: and now she has lived for a long time without any more bones coming out, and she still emits a little pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not confirm this foreign matter, unless because there is knowledge and help from the skill and craft of the physician who administers it by hand for healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	¶ On the forms of necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of a constrictor, by which the books are equalized, where there are two handles on the two ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this handle should be thinner than the constrictor: and it is made from either ebony or boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of all the wood is almost like two fingers: and the edge of each of them is almost like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been fastened in both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each of them is almost like two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother, so that it opens with them when you turn the two Vertigines.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of Vertigines that opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Make it from the wood of ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there are two additions, as you see above: and the length of all the addition is almost a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	Therefore when you want to open the womb with it, then make her sit on the bed, hanging her feet, with what is open between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additions joined into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you want from the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of another Vertigines which they said the ancients called Forma Impellentis, by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, by which the large head is crushed: and it resembles forceps, to which there are teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it becomes crooked, like forceps in this form, as you see, to which there are teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of Uncinus having one hook.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of Uncinus having two hooks.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The shape of the forceps with saw-toothed teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of the Spatula Forceps, which has two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of the Spatula Forceps, also called Levers.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used and the more their species multiply and are prepared by the craftsman, the faster they are for their operation and higher among people, due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise an instrument from them, which is prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For the necessity of them is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	¶ On the Extraction of the Afterbirth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should order the weak one to hold on to her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a vinegar: and tie your hand over her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it comes out through this, good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	Then take a pot and drill a hole in the abdomen: and put in it opening the womb herbs, such as calamint, rue, and aneth, and camomile, and savory, and oak sawdust, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and soak them with water, and put them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a bundle of reeds on the hole of the abdomen pot, and another end in the womb: and hold it until the steam reaches the hollow of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the Afterbirth will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however there remains after this treatment and it does not emerge: then command the midwife to immerse her hand in either sisamin oil or the thick juice of the mallow plant.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should insert it into the uterus and seek out the secondina with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she has found it, then she should receive it and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it is attached deep in the womb, then she should insert her hand according to what we have narrated until when she finds the secondina, and gradually extracts it according to straightness, so that the matrix does not fall during a strong traction: rather it should be changed with facility to the right and left sides: then add to the amount of traction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For she indeed obeys at that time and is preserved and avoids adhesions.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If however the mouth of the matrix is contracted, as we have already narrated: treat it with sneezing and from the remedy of the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If however it does not emerge with all that we have narrated, then beware lest you exhaust her in the repetition of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	However it is necessary that what emerges from the mouth of the matrix from it be tied to the hip of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then cleanse her with the ointment tetrapharmacon.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For indeed it will rot her after days and dissolve and emerge.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However when it rots, the bad smell is removed from her and goes to the stomach and head, and harms that weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore it is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered to that one.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	For some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument used to smoke a woman during retention of Secundine and menstrual flow.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let a similar instrument be made from iron or bronze, and place its wide end over the fire: and let the smoking be placed on the prunes: hold it until that smoking is consumed: and repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the cure of the unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born, and their anuses are not perforated, which have already been sewn up with a fine thread.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife should pierce it with her finger: and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp spatula: and she should beware of the hand, lest she touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place on it a lint soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it will be sewn up, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now the sewing up of the anus also occurs from the healing of the wound or from abscesses.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it should be sutured, then treated with what we said from the cure and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the cure of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodulation and Grossitude which occur near the anus, which are deformed: or in the space of one part: and it is a fistula, or more.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that nodulation becomes old, it opens, and flows out from it watery white fluid, or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes among these fistulas are those that penetrate.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, those that penetrate are known by what comes out of it during defecation and softness, when an infirm person is used for defecation: and perhaps it comes out of these worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And among them are fistulas when they are in space penetrating up to the bladder, and up to the vaginal opening.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And among them are those that penetrate up to the hip joint, and up to the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	But from the fact that it is known as a penetrating fistula up to the anus, even if it does not penetrate, is to insert your finger into the anus: and to insert a thin probe from air, or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin lead probe into it, or a horsehair pin from horsehairs, until you feel the probe, or the pin in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	But if you do not feel it entirely, and nothing comes out of the opening from defecation, and softness, nor worms as I said: then you will know that it is not penetrating: so hasten to healing.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating up to the bladder, or to the urethral opening: then its meaning is the exit of urine from it, and its prevention from this that the place may consolidate with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is penetrating up to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no tortuosity up to the bone: and the discovery of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus comes out of it always: and that medication does not hold in it, nor consolidates with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	In these fistulas that penetrate deeply, there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is a labor and vanity, from foolish doctors, under whom they are formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating and not ancient, there is hope of healing with a probe, according to what I tell you, and I have already tested: and it is, that the sick person lies under your hands on his back: and raise his legs up above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then he will insert the pointed end of lead or air, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where it has reached with the probe.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if the sick person feels it around his anus, then you must insert your finger into his anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel that the probe has already penetrated through itself detected, besides what you feel between your finger and him, or flesh: then you will certainly know that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor in it, since there is no healing in it, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	But they said that in some men flesh is healed, and from the medication by which it is hoped to be improved, it is, that you burn a thin cauterizing iron according to the size of the fistula, as was said before, and insert it into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice, or three times, until you know that all the flesh added to the filtered ashes is burned, which are like the cannula of a bird's feather.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for that with uncovered linens in butter, until those flesh which are burned come out: then care for that with ointments generating and consolidating flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then never with another cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if he escapes, try, and if he does not reach your finger, which is in the anus, and is between him and the tent, being thick with flesh, or sifac: and you see a fistula following the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go drying with the tent that is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches where the end of the tent reaches, and the tent is freed and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered fleshy parts, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if the blood overcomes you, and dissolves between you and your operation so that you can cut those fleshy parts: then it is better and quicker to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because the cauterizer with fire brings good conditions, it adds burning of those fleshy parts added, and separation of blood, and drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for that with unfolded linens in butter, or crushed with cauls, until the place emits pus, and those burned fleshy parts come out in pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for that wound with consolidating ointments, generating hard flesh: and they are medicines in which there is stypticism and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then already he is healed: and do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus, and is separated from the excess of the body: then put your finger in the anus, and inquire with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If you feel a pull and there is between you and it, a linen cloth or flesh, and it is near to penetration, then there is no operation on that unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is administered in three ways: either by cauterizing it, as we have said, or by separating it, until you reach its concavity, so that it may be possible for you to introduce the lint and healing from the nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the cut, so that you do not cut the muscle containing the anus, and it happens above the weak exit of defecation without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for that with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it may be healed: or extend that linen, and cleanse it after you have separated it almost to the anus, as we have said, or with another sharp-ended tool.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those fleshy parts which are in the cut, until you can with inspection.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the healing of the wound with the cut, and the upper opening where it is solidified: and there remains an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter on the weak.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula will follow in this way: and it is, when you insert the tent into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and the margin of the anus: then take the sharp-ended tool, which is like a needle, that is, preparing hides, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a rolled thread from five threads, and about it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the tent with the thread into the fistula, until you reach its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If the penetration is near the inner edge of the anus, then remove a thread from that opening: insert your finger into the anus and remove the thread's end, gather both ends at once, tie them together, and release it on one or two days: the longer the thread in the flesh, the more tightly you should tie it until the flesh between the two ends of the thread rots away, then care for the wound until it heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate however you are prepared to do so, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it does not matter if you do not cut into the muscle, as long as you do not harm it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the same method until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the spatula used to probe the fistula, whose sharpness is very acute on one side and not on the other, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On stitching hemorrhoids from which blood flows from the incision of them: and care for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For they are either inside the anus, like coal or prune stones: or they are like grains of wheat themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and it is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its ends.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows yellowish water or little blood flowing constantly: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure for what is inside the anus is, as you command the sick person to squat: and it is expressed until the anus appears to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also hang them with thorns: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they do not hold in them thorns, because of their moisture and softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a coarse cloth from double-woven wool, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and powder over them after the incision some hot powders, so that they stick in the place of the cauterizer.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not obey the outflow, then enema the sick person with a clyster in which there is a small bitterness, so that it cleanses with what is in the anus, and obeys outflow quickly, when the sick person expels himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the thorns are outside the anus, then the matter is light, easy: and it is that you take them with your nail, or take them with a thorn, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And who abhors incision with iron, then it is necessary that the administrator suture their wounds according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a raw thread, and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then extract the thorns to the upper part, and make it penetrate with the needle from the other side of its root: and wrap up two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and they are horizontally: and tie the thorns with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then remove the thread, and extract the splinter.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the needles, and let one go from each of them: do not cut it yourself, so that there will be no excessive bleeding from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or carron oil on the buttocks, and place it on the buttocks: and command the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it go until it falls out.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the needles therefore fall out, take care of them with ointments and the rest of the healing, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	¶ On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often it happens from the dryness of the feces, and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they therefore become dry, and do not work in them medicine: then it is necessary to scrape with the Spatumilis needle, or with your nail, until they become moist, and remove the upper skin which prevents them from consolidating.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them, until they consolidate as it should be.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate: then repeat them with a stronger razor than the first, until they bleed much, and then peel off, and take care of them, until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	¶ On the treatment of wounds that are not turned over, and those that are turned over: and of needles that have been bitten by ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that Almirmar is not other than a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the claw: and it is made throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet, and fingers: and it happens from them pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it is necessary to follow what is in the circumference of the claw, and to be held with forceps, or with a needle, and to be removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then, if you wish, you can cauterize it according to what was previously mentioned in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	However, from the flat surface of the body, there is a small, rough, porous, round projection.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often, this happens in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to stretch the skin, and cut it: or to tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, you can cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine: and now the opposite warts, and not the opposite, will be removed with the tool that I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	However, a formica is also a small, porous projection on the surface of the body, which penetrates deeply into the valley: and when it finds cold, it feels like a stinging bite of an ant, and it happens throughout the body: and it does the most harm in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a needle from the quill of a goose, or the quill of a strong-winged bird: and place it on the formica, until the circle of the needle contains its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the needle, until you separate what is in the circumference of the formica: and place it in deep flesh, and remove the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, you can do it with a needle of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the needle be pulling the uncovered ear towards its height, so that it will relieve the pain of its grasp and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, you can cauterize the formica according to what was previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization of warts.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Translation: On the forms of instruments used for lancing and treating anus, relieving intestinal obstruction, and treating colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes a lancet is made of silver, or of gold-plated brass, or of bronze, or of hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made small and large, according to those in which they are used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, the lancet used for treating young children should be small, and if their anuses are weak or painful, so too should their lancing be.
Clistere magnum.	A large lancet.
Cistere paruum.	A small lancet.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The handle of the lancet, that is, the upper part in which the string is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and it should have a separation so that the string ties as you see, and the lower part that is inserted into the anus, should be deaf, that is, not open, smooth, sharp, drawing to subtlety: and in one of its sides there should be two holes, and in the other side there should be one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the size of the holes should be according to the thickness of the needles, and a little smaller, and it should have a container in which medicines are placed from the bladder of an animal: or from paper, which is according to the shape of a small asofrati: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced through the holes many times as it is turned, and there should be a space that is the thickness of a digit between each hole.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, which is from ten threads, or about that number, and gather with it the container like an asofrati.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore it is placed in that container, it should be tied at the head of the lancet between two distinct contractions with a strong tie.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then apply a poultice with that.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	This is the shape of the circle as depicted here, and the hole.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of applying the poultice with that is: to fill a vessel, or bladder, from medicine, which should be heated according to the amount of tolerance of the sick: and beware that it is not very hot, or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick person should lie on their back, and raise their legs to the top: and place under them a blanket, that is, skin on which men lie, or linen.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then apply oil, or with white of egg, or with mucilage of fenugreek, or similar, to the extremity of the poultice.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the attendant should receive the vessel with both hands at the same time, and squeeze it with force, until all that is in the poultice comes out into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the poultice, and raise the sick person's legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine requires it to go out, then hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is better in the cure.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you apply a poultice to him in the pains of the solution of the belly, and hasten its exit: then repeat the poultice, until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids, or painful abscesses in the anus, then it should be a thin, very soft poultice, from the poultices with which children are treated.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the shape of the thin poultice on which there is a tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	About the cure of wounds of the head without breaking bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken of the division of wound treatment in the book, and now I will explain its cure with the hand and with medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore that wounds are divided according to the way they are made and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things by which wounds are often made are like the throw of a stone: or an incision with a sword or knife; or percussion with a lance, a stick, or an arrow: and similar things from many objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds which are made according to the parts of the body are like a wound which falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or back: and similar from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling the cure of certain wounds, so that I may set forth this reasoning and rule upon the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds, because the memory of complex ones will come at the beginning of Chapter Third.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of bone: consider then if it is from the throw of a stone or similar things, and already it has broken the skin only: and it is a large wound, and you fear for the bad outcome of a hot suppuration: then hasten, and perform a cephalic bleeding immediately: and do not hesitate to do this: and take out from his blood according to the quantity of its power: if there is nothing prohibiting bleeding from phlebotomy, especially if it is blood that exits from the wound in small amounts.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bleeding be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	Let him be cautious of himself from overfilling, and wine, and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If however something prohibits a mincement, then it should be reduced from the food, and not approach meats, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place upon the wound if it happens to him an abscess hot, a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If however you are secure from the hot abscess, then place upon the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and not changed its air, powder which I will tell after a little: and if already changed it, then place upon it some ointments, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If however the wound is large, or is from a cut of a sword, and similar: and not gather its lips with pledgets, then gather it with stitches, according to which I will tell in wounds of the belly about their stitches.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If however the wound is already detected from the bone, and hangs, and not retention of it, except in a small suspension: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and command the sick, to be fed on foods in which is bulkiness, as are heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulp: and similar.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If however you find in the skin putrefaction, and not adheres to bone: then cut the rotten whole, and throw it away: then care for it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however in these wounds is an artery, or vein from which flows blood: and not cut through medicines, then look upon the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If however you find it not severed, then dry it with Spatumili, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity calls when it does not provide what we said, then cauterize it until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small, simple, then the matter is easy, light: so that you sprinkle this powder on them, because it hardens them before they change due to air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of Powder for Flesh Wounds.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe one part of honey, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburned lime: grind it all thoroughly, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly, until it sticks well on top of it, and coagulates with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it from above with bandages, and let it go, and do not untie it while it remains, so that it does not stick.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For this medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes it does this alone, when you do not have honey, and dragon's blood in your presence: and lime also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is placed on them and bound, and are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not changed due to air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If it has already changed due to some alteration, especially when it is in the time of summer, then this powder is not in position: therefore take care of it with what we said, so that you put on top of it some digestive ointments: or put on top of it some poultices made with barley flour, with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the rest of the healing, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	But if it happens with the wound a fracture in bone, and it is small, then remove it with Gesti: and I will now tell you about the healing of fractures of the head in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if the nerve of the neck has already been cut, or the artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except that its cure should be avoided with that which causes strong styptic action, such as zinarius, and zegi, and similar substances.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because nerves are harmful and they contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And you should not place anything at all cold on the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuity is with the brain, which is higher than the members: and let that be used to cure from medicines gently, such as limewater with sweet water, often infused with oil, or with red oil, and tuthia, when it is also washed with sweet water: and the other mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then apply a suture: or cut off its lips with cotton.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wound is deep, or it occurs in that sinus in the lower part of it, in which already pus has accumulated, then perforate it in a more depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	But if the artery has already been cut in the wound, and blood flow has resulted from it: then separate, or dry it, and ligate it: or cauterize it, if necessity requires it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the spines of the neck have already been cut, or the whole, and the alhaudegi have been saved: then gather the lips of the skin with a suture on the cannula of the neck, and do not touch the neck, but rather even it, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tie it with a decent ligature and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments that have astringency and drying properties until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then probe it: if there are any bone fragments in it, remove them all, or as much as you can from them: and what cannot be prepared, leave it until the wound rots and separates and its discharge is relieved.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then apply powder that I have mentioned to it.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If however it seems that there is a bone in the wound and a fistula forms, then care for it with the remedy that I mentioned in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	About the wound in the forceps.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a puncture of the lance or the knife, and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore a fetid gas escapes from the wound when the patient pants because of it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is recent with its own blood, then do not apply powder to it from the first hour, nor tie it up so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient: but put on it a drawing ointment and dissolve it in the day twice.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If however the ointment is not present to you, then put on the opening of the wound an old cotton, so that it sucks out what escapes from it because of its moisture: and make the patient sleep over the wound, so that what gathers in it may be drawn out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If however three days or more have already passed since the wound, and no spasm has occurred to the patient, nor a bad trembling of the heart, nor a stricture in breathing, and you see the rest of its conditions good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Cure yourself and with your companions, and with the rest of the treatment, until you are healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	However, if indeed his cure is excused and it always opens up, then you know that it has already become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Cure yourself from your chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from an incision of a sword, or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest, or the back: then cure yourself with that which preceded from the stitch, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and it has broken off from it fragments: then inquire the wound, and hasten to remove those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated, then leave them, until the wound rots, for the extraction of them is relieved.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	However, the judgment of other wounds occurring in other members in treatment, is the judgment of that which we said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	§ On wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their exit.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which happens to the belly is great, and middle, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great one sometimes the intestine exits, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore the introduction of them, and their stitch is more urgent and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small rupture also becomes difficult from another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore it follows that the reduction of them is difficult, if you do not hasten to their introduction to their place immediately: for it swells, opens up, and becomes full: therefore the entrance of its difficulty.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore it becomes a better rupture of the middle one: for since with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You should know that there are four types of sutures for a wound.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	There are two common sutures that meet in the umbilical wound and in the wounds of the rest of the body, and there are two other sutures that properly communicate with the other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper with the umbilical suture, and I tell you each one with explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, because when the wound is small and something comes out of the intestine from it, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is for one of the two reasons.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said: or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold from the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	Therefore when it is like that, then you should warm it, so that you immerse the sponge, or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with vinegar, and pepper, and salt, and marjoram with the intestine, until the inflation is dissolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes it does that wine in which there is hemostasis: and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which it was boiled again, or warm.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through that it is relieved from its small opening.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if the return of it is excused after this cure, then cut in a small rupture, with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than cutting: and no force is made to cut after need and lack of instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be which is twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the tip not thin with thinness of Spatumilis, but rather a little blunt: and that is what resembles a caul, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When a wound becomes larger and enters the intestine, it is necessary to reduce it back to its natural form in its proper place, if possible, because this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When indeed the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary to make the person lie on their back with their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place their head lower and elevate their chest higher than their lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	Similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your attention and always consider this, that the part in which the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary to apply this in large wounds and in middle wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, apply it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that a faithful servant is present between your hands who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and gather his lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then gradually expose from it to the one who follows a suture something after something: and this is the common method of suturing one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you receive a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's width.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go of the quantity of a finger's ring, that is, a doctor's: and fix the needle one on which you insert the thread in both skin ends, with two skin ends that are from the interior, until you make it penetrate from the other part, and now you have gathered two skin ends and two sifac ends: and four rows are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with a double thread around the wound, using a needle from two sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are gathered together neatly.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the thickness of the finger and fix a needle on it as well: after that, lace it with a thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not stop doing that with the one you need from the beds until you complete the constriction of the wound entirely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be of medium thickness between the thickness and thinness: for thin needles are very quick to penetrate flesh: and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be of medium thickness in both thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary, that the needle be fixed in both edges of the skin nearby too much: so that the flesh does not penetrate quickly, and the wound is not opened before its consolidation, and they do not extend even with the stitch, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not wound the weak one while he is asleep: and place cotton pads from all sides, which hold the ends of the needles: and let them go, until you know that the wound has been consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For one needle in their stitch is enough, or two, or about that.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second stitch is common, so that it gathers with the first stitch the four ends: ends, two of the skin, and two of the thread in the vice one, with the needle in which the thread is wrapped equally in thinness, and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, reduce the needle from the part where you began, so that a thread soaked in honey falls from the upper part of the wound: so that it may be a suture, just as they stitch together pieces of cloth, and place between every suture an amount of thickness equal to the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This suture, however, people know.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture, I healed the wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was a tear larger than a span of one hand: and it had exited from the intestines about two spans from the middle intestine, and there was a tear in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I therefore reduced it after it had stood out from his intestine outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was therefore healed in the space that it was approximately fifteen days: and I cared for him, and he was healed: and he lived after that for many years, returning to his former condition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors had judged, that he would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And by a miracle, it was that I did not care for him with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where ointment was not found, nor anything from the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore I placed over the wound old cloth twice a day, and I assiduously washed it with honeyed water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	Two therefore species of suture proper I will say according to the account of the language.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and goes into the muscle going according to the length and width of the whole body: let go the end of the suture in the side in which you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate in another extremity from the inner part to the outer in the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate thus in the same extremity from the outer part to the inner: and let go the extremity which is on this side, and make the point penetrate the other extremity from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration as you make it penetrate in that extremity of the mirror, which is on its part, until it penetrates entirely into it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also begin from this same side, and withdraw it entirely with the extremity which is on its part, and take out the point from the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then also bring it back into that skin, and withdraw its extremity which is on its part, with that extremity of the mirror: and take it out from the skin which is on its part, and make one of them thus, and the other: and make one after another, until you have withdrawn entirely outwards according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this stitching is that you stitch with the same thread which they use to stitch skins: so that you stitch one of them thus from one part of one extremity of the skin: and so that you let go it thus from another part of another, until you have completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper stitching, which Gale nus said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This his speech was told, that you should stitch it according to the likeness in which some physicians use them, so that they gather all part to its suitable corresponding part by nature: and apply the extremity of the mirror to its other extremity, and the extremity of the mirror to its other.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should insert the needle into the tip of the probe near to you from the outer side, and make it penetrate to the inner part in that soil; and dismiss its two ends.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outer side to the inner part in its two ends, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both of them, and also make them penetrate from the inner to the outer side in their two ends, namely in the two other probes which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than a common and easy suture, and it is the suture which precedes the remembrance.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also the word of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly should be corrected with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, you should insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who equalize the hides.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly: then its suture is more difficult than the sutures of the other parts of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment indeed of the wound's medication, is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you seek the recent wound with its own blood, before it changes itself by the air: and reduce the intestine, and its own, and prepare it: then place on top of the powder of the flesh of the incarnate.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already changed the wound: then place on it some ointments which are present with you, until they make pus: and fall off the threads, and strengthen the sutures, and the probe.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then, care for it as is the cure of the remaining wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have the medicines present to you, then put on it immediately, after it begins to emit pus, a wet and old cloth: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medication in many situations, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound will spread to the main members in the injury, then it is necessary that you immerse a soft cloth in warm-tempered oil, or in rose oil: and place it in the circumference of the places which are between the groins, and under the buttocks.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	But if he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then enema him with a strengthening wine, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and become a penetrating one up to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the thick intestine is easier to healing: and that which is from the thin ones, more difficult to healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called the Jejunum does not take healing from the wound which happens in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from veins, and their size, and because of the thinness of its body, and because of its proximity to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the wound is pus, and you collect it recently: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if it has passed by him a space, and now it is green, or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place which has become black from it, so that blood does not flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In the joints are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of a string hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the pull on you will be relieved by its attraction, and its extraction in case of a joint injury, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember the wound that occurred in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the intestine and is small, it is possible for some people to be restored: because I have seen a man who was wounded in his abdomen with the impact of a lance, and it was a wound on the right side of the stomach, and it was an old wound: and a fistula formed, and he exited from it with excretion and flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I placed a remedy, until I was not confident in his healing: nor did I cease to refine him, until he was healed and the place was solidified.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already solidified, I was afraid of the weak one, that something bad would happen to him in his abdomen: and it did not happen to him from that bad thing.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in his better conditions, eating and drinking, and defecating, and entering the bath, and exercising in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some experimenter said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small, then it is necessary to tie it according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you take ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather the two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth on top of the two wound lips.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore he puts it on that, and closes his mouth, cut off his head, for it sticks and is not released.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease doing that with the ant after the second ant according to the amount of the wound throughout.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then bring him back, and his wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is eaten, and he is healed, and no harm is caused to him completely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible that the intestine is even bound with a fine thread: which is removed from the intestine of the animal, and is attached with it when it enters the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And there is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is fouled much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie in its end a thin thread wrapped up.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle, and with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then bring him back in the disruption.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of stitching with ants and intestine is not but according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, the wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then there is no cure but suturing, and there is no healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	§ On the care of fistulas, and abscesses.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound, or abscess when it grows old and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus always, and is not cut off: then it is universally called in whatever member it is fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	A fistula, in truth, is a filtered constriction, hard, white: with which there is no pain, nor is there a concavity of a bird's feather; and because of this, some call it Risatus, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And in some hours, it emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	Perhaps the moisture is torn in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and is little; and it is coarse, and it is delicate.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor is there flesh born in it, is not that except for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the lack of blood in the body: or because of its malevolence: or because between him and his lips there is flesh hard, preventing the birth of flesh: or because it is very dirty and filthy: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is put into it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is inconvenient in its cure: or because corruption falls in the region, a kind of pestilence, or by property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where there is difficult digestion of sufferings, and healing of pus is delayed in it by nature: or because in it is one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and signs of them, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary for me to do here to make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is made by way of operation with hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that Fistula happens in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	From these (wounds) are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sciatic, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some from the ribs, or to some from the spine, or to some from the composite joints, such as hands and feet, and from these are those that approach the proximity of the main member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, from these (fistulas), according to this method, is difficult healing due to illness, and it does not receive a cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if it is from any fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I mentioned: and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to approach the knowledge of it, then take a probe from air, or iron, if the fistula tends towards straightness, and seek it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, being soothed by its own body, is relieved and cured around twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	But if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to signify over it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, cysterize from these opening from its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture by which you cysterize itself goes towards other openings and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, inquire according to what manner it is possible for you: so that you may know what is the bone, or nerve, and whether the fistula's cavity is long or near: or whether it is a fistula with many openings, and stands on the whole of it, with great strength of yours, with your questioning, when you question the infirm, and in invention of pain at compression with your hand on the place, and similar signs and causes of abscess.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you stand on all those true stations, then go to healing according to your confidence: and it is, that you consider then, if it is a fistula near appearing, or in a safe place far from the junction, or from the nerve, or the artery, or the vein, or one of the places which I told you: then seal the fistula according to what was previously mentioned from my narration, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupt flesh, which is born in its mouth from flesh, or thelul, and similar things: and cure that, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is of great depth, and is according to straightness: then it is necessary that you seal it in the deep as much as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all its corrupt flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer pure linen in sharp medicines: and introduce it until the depth of the fistula which you comprehended with iron: do with it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the depth of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal by that, then cauterize it according to what we told you.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is certified to you that: then inquire that, and seal it according to what I told you: if something does not prohibit you from the vein, or the nerve, or the principal member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore a bone is exposed to you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it, until the corruption of it is all removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that wound with what has healed it, until it is cured.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	But if it does not heal, and it emits pus as it did before, then you will know that you have not reached the complete removal of corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Then clean it again with the second layer, and make a thorough examination of its reason and cleansing of itself with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals, then it is good: but if it does not, then you will know that that corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, it is not your duty to abandon nature itself.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	But if the corrupted part is small and it is possible for you to do so, then draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then make a thorough extraction of them all, and do not leave any of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	But if something contradicts you from the moisture, and there is no fear or mistake in the incision of them, then cut those moistures and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	But if you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your hour, then place on the wound what will putrefy it: and leave it until that which is in the vicinity of those bones from flesh and moisture putrefies.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And it is bound together with the section that you have cut in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	I say, place it on top of it, if you fear, a cloth soaked in ground sulfur with oil: or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green herb of ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	When those moist putrefactions decay, and the bones are separated from them, the removal of these bones is relieved, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if there is one large bone, such as the thigh bone, or the hip bone, and similar to these, and that which has decayed from it is a large part: then shave it with the last razor, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if that which is in it has decayed, and it is a large part, and corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it entirely until the place where corruption has reached: then care for it, until it becomes solid.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you about the zuken that happened to a man in his thigh: so that you may place this example and help on your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years old, to whom pain occurred in his thigh, caused by something that moved over him within the body, that is, from inside, until the matter reached the leg, and a large abscess formed: and there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, he extended with him time with the error of doctors, until the abscess was opened, and they gathered with him many matters.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And the cure of his was postponed until the leg was fistulated, and there were made in him many openings: all of which emitted pus and bodily moistures.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, he suffered from many doctors for about two years, and there was not in him a wise one in the art of hands, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matters that were running out from those openings with great speed: even his whole man's body was already shriveled, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore, introduce the probe into one of the body's orifices, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the orifices: and I found that they all reach each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Therefore, I pressed, and cut across one of those orifices, until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it rotten: which was already decayed, discolored, and putrefied, and perforated, until it reached the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore scraped off what I had detected, and prepared it from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I assigned, that there was not in the bone except that corruption which I had cut and scraped off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the healing of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed, and exposed above the bone second above the first detection: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I scraped off what appeared to me even from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore, I exposed it again, and did not stop inserting the bone separately, and trying to restore it: and it was not restored, until I inserted about a palm's length, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and there was no need for this repetition in the operation of it, and cutting of itself, except because of the weakness of the infirmity, and shortness of its tolerance, and my fear of it from death: because it happened to him in every hour from excessive evacuation syncope diseases.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was healed by a complete cure: and flesh was born in the place of the bone, and it was good for the arrangement in his body, and his strength returned to him; and he returned to his own arrangements: and he did not cause him any harm at all in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the bone is already broken in the place of the body: then it is necessary to bind it like this: and you take a bandage, and tie it at the end of the prominent bone: and command someone to stretch it upwards: and put another bandage made of coarse wool first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh, which is under the bone: and extend its end, so that you can pull the flesh downwards: and you cover the flesh over the place where you want to saw, so that the saw does not hurt the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood or a board under the lower bone, because when you do this, it does not prevent the flesh from becoming rotten.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be on the place of the corruption a little, so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and forces it to another sawing of its kind.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted, and it is not prominent, but continues with its part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in its own part: then cover the flesh from all its parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a piece of wood underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then saw it from the first side, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues from the other side: and the sawing should be according to the length from the corruption a little, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint: cut the corrupted joint, and saw the bone from the other side where it continues.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed there is corruption in the connection of two joints, then there is no skill in it except for amputation.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If however the corruption is in the pectoral fin of the hand or in the pectoral fin of the foot, then it is quite difficult in that case.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	However, you must investigate how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And amputate it, and clean it according to any possible arrangement for you, and with whatever skill it is corrected for you, when it does not give you opposition of the vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you should know that there are many teeth and saws for cutting these bones according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their coarseness, and their fineness, and their size, and their evenness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary to prepare every kind of instrument suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you should know that these operations signify to you the kind of instrument that you lack, when you are with a long study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of these methods of this art is a testimony of the methods of diseases: then indeed you will find for yourself that which is suitable to it from the instruments for all infirmity.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you in the last number of this chapter's instruments, which you place examples on which you cut, and proof by which you experience on another.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This saw form is depicted, should be made properly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arc be made sharp from iron: and its handle be made of boxwood, and it should be pyramidally made properly.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the razor for suturing wounds.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	The head of this razor should be in the form of a star-shaped clasp, and its points should be in the form of the points of an eschalot.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not suit, except that it should be rubbed with it the heads of the sutures when they are rotten, or a large mouth and a large one is.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the middle razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of another delicate razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of another curved extremity razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of a small delicate testing razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the razor with which the bones are inserted.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Also the form of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a drill, and its end is like a saw: it will be shown in many places from the reason of the bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the razor that suits its reason that is pierced through the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, and its sharp ends are.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made of Indian.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it should be made of all that we have said of the razors, and the knives, and the saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Of cutting the ends, and sawing the bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends rot, either by an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have cured that corruption with the medicine of the doctor, and it does not bring about a cure: and you see the corruption falling into the member, which does not rebound at all: then it is necessary that you cut that member as far as where the corruption follows, so that the weak one may escape through that from death, or from the malice which is greater than the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that occurs in this case is that the limb is blackened, until it is thought to have been burned by fire or has decayed after a discoloration: until that putrefaction reaches as far as the following limb, and spreads throughout the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when the incision is made, and if the cause of decay is from the impact of certain venomous creatures, such as sea scorpions, vipers, and rattle snakes, and the like.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the decay or impact is at the end of the finger, then cut the finger, and do not leave any space for decay, so that it may reach as far as the other hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the wrist, and do not leave any space for decay, until it reaches as far as the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it attacks in that place, then cut the arm at the elbow, in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if decay passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then there is death of the weak one.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer besides that for cure, is a quantity of power.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when decay attacks in the finger, then cut it at one joint: and if it takes hold of the claw of the foot, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it climbs up to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	But if decay has already reached above the knee, then there is no cure in it, except to let go and leave the weak one to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way of cutting the limb, or sawing it, is to tie the ligament on the lower one, which you wish to cut: and tie the ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And the assistant extends one ligament downwards: and the assistant extends another ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a sharp spatula, until the flesh is completely exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut, or tightened.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to place cloth on all parts of the body, and not touch the healthy place with the saw: and a wound is added to the injured person, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if bleeding occurs inside while operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or put on top of it some powders that absorb blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with the appropriate ligament for it, and care for it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, the same thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because blackness occurred in his foot, with burning that resembles the burning of fire: and that corruption first occurred in his finger, until he began to have his whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man removed himself from himself, after he saw corruption occurring in his member with its severity, which he found from pain, and burning of it: and it occurred to him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after he had passed a long time, that same corruption occurred to him in his finger of his hand index.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with him which I put on his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and that excess was not reflected, and it began to occur in another finger: until corruption occurred in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He therefore called me to cut his hand, but I refused to do so, hoping for a cure from the rebound of that excessive blood flow: and I also feared death itself during the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the power of man was over that case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he therefore gave up hope from me, he returned to his own land: and he came to me from that, because he hurriedly cut off his whole hand, and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this account, unless it be a help concerning that which falls under the type of this sickness: and that there be a signification by which it is signified, and according to which it is treated.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Concerning the care of fistulas, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the duration of the abscesses is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or is perforated, and that which is in it, as if it were excrement, escapes, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it, like a fabric which has become thin: and it does not reach to its ultimate corruption, nor imprints itself on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a sinus: and it is not called a fistula: nevertheless if the duration of its existence is prolonged until it imprints corruption on some of these members, then it is called a fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its care is, that you cut off that entire skin as it rolls back: and especially when it has become thin, and has been made like a fabric: and you trust that it will not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If you hope that the skin will stick and there will be no corruption in the final result: and if there is thickness in the skin from the flesh, then treat it with Clister: and it is, that you should look to the Ear.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul smell: then treat it with Egyptian medicine, which is acetic acid, oil, and zinc, equal parts are received, they are poured into a jar: and they are cooked over fire, until the medicine turns red: and it becomes as thick as honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and treat the Ear with it: and tie the opening of it, and let the medicine into it at a quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then take it out with expression: make it for days so many, until the Ear is cleansed, and the smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is treated with water of ashes, when you are not present with this medicine: and it is, that you should take charcoal of willows, or charcoal of ilex woods: and throw it on it water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then clean it, and treat it with it, until you trust that the Ear is already cleaned.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor water of ashes, then treat it with water and honey, which has already mixed some of the crushed zinc.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or treat it with honey and wine mixed, because of the property of honey is to cleanse, and wash: and the wine makes the Ear stick, especially when there is an excess of tonicity and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this frequently and trust that the sin of corruption is already removed, then cleanse it with what causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take from the plaster of dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil and strengthening wine: or cleanse it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice of the sinus is narrow, in which the catheter does not fit: then enlarge it slightly with a little iron: or place in it a rolled-up piece of linen in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also large, then gather its lips with a stitch: and let out from it as much as the catheter enters without adding anything.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which the pus flows is elevated: then dry it in a lower place that is in it, so that the pus may flow out from it downwards: for when pus is confined in the depths of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to dry the sinus around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the member with preparation by which pus may flow out from it with ease according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to make sure that nothing at all from the pus remains in it: and take solidifying medicines which are placed on the sign, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them on linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And the cloth should be of such a quantity that the entire sinus may be covered.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then, cut with forceps directly into the opening of the sinus, a bit beyond the opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then, spread a thin layer of ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening: and place it on top of that, positioned far from the sinus opening, so as to facilitate the exit of pus from it: and do not remove a large cloth unless after several days.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	However, the one that is above the sinus opening, is the one that you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it from pus can come out: and so that you know whether that which runs out of it is much or little, digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether it feels pain in it, or not, and whether there is an abscess in it, or not, and whether there is an abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Therefore, when your treatment is given in this way, and you see the matter that comes out through the sinus opening, then you know that the sinus has already adhered, or approached adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you heal the wound, then change the cloth and reapply the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if pus comes out of the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who slow down the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then you know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	Therefore, if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its duration is prolonged, then add in the drying of the medicines, but let the doctors make the medicines in their substance wet and in their dryness virtue: such as ointment dyafinicon when added to it an excess of zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the most recent, that is cured, it is, that you take the unguent of diaphenic, and it is dissolved with rose oil, and it is rubbed on top of old wine equal in substance to it.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now it does a similar action to this, when the unguent of diaphenic is not present to you, honey, when you melt it, until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind all of it, and powder it on top of honey while it is on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then line it on top of the cloth, and tie it over the sinus: and line with honey that you melted, until it thickens: and powder it on top of it, and put it on top of the cloth, and tie it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes it is administered in that aristolochia longa, and the roots of the heavenly lily, and it is lily: and the flour of the herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or mixed, grind it, and the mortar itself: and powder it on top of the honey that I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the sinus lasts, and it is not healed by this cure: then you know that there is corruption in its depth: or already it makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard limbs, or ligaments: then cure it with the cure of fistulas, according to what was previously mentioned.

Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritium is an abscess that is born under the nail of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it is born in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When, therefore, the disease is prolonged and its cure is neglected, it festers with a hot abscess: or it rots, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, so that there is an offensive odor: and it becomes the end of the digit broad, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When, therefore, you cure it yourself, with what we said in the division, and do not bring about its cure: then it is necessary for you to cut off with a knife all the remaining excess from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For the cautery is very healing.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	But if the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the additions of the nail already compress the flesh to the interior, and they begin to prick it, and they wound it: then you must place a fine needle under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut the flesh with ease, and put on what remains of the flesh from burning, corrosive medicines, until it is all removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	But if the corruption has already pressed into the bone, then you must cut that bone, and remove it: for it will never be healed as long as the corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	But if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading into the digit, then cut it at one node, according to what was previously remembered of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	But if an injury occurs to the nail, or a blow: and pain occurs in it, then you must bleed the sick person first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then, dry the nail with a sharp spatula, making a transverse cut from above downwards.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard against the cut reaching the flesh beneath the nail, for you would cause severe pain and it would be a cause for delayed healing of the flesh in that location.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the wound with whatsoever alleviates pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	However, the finger added to some men's hands may be entirely fleshy: and perhaps they have bones, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born in the root of the joint, or its birth is in certain knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, he who is born in certain knots of the finger does not move: and he who is born at the joint of the finger may perhaps move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, for him who is fleshy among them, the cut is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, you should cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, for him whose birth is in the root of the joint, care is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, avoid cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	However, for him who is born in the finger at the last knot, then you should cut into the first flesh of his round cut up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws fitting for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the consolidation that occurs in fingers afterward often happens either from the birth of the man, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, you should separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a linen cloth, or infused cloths in rose oil: so that they do not stick together quickly, and separate between them: or place between them a thin sheet of lead, until the wound is healed according to what is appropriate.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if there is consolidation by certain fingers with the palm, then dry that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Chapter on the Incision Wound.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are ulcers that are covered, thick, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body: and the most common outcome of them is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work and carry.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary that the practitioner perform a strong excitation of the body from black bile, several times.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then phlebotomy of the patient in the basilica.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	Healing of them with iron, is indeed according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is, that they be dried and the black blood be drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is, that the vein be raised and all of it be drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The incision of it is indeed according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, the leg is fomented with hot water much, until the thick, dirty blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the weak leg from its upper part of the hip, to the lower part of the knee with a cloth.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry the vein in one place, or two, or three wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise, that is, draw out the blood from the lower part of the leg, upwards, and from the upper part it should be that the phlebotomist weakens the first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then, cut off the nail with a sharp instrument until blood comes out in an amount that you see is sufficient and that the weakness of the patient can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	After that, bandage it and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full and it harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, his evacuation is done in this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the patient if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then, put him into a warm bath: or apply hot water to his leg with hot water, until it reddens and the veins are full: or exercise him with strong exercise if there is no bath present, until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then, cut the skin directly over the vein section along its length: or at the last part of his leg near the knee, or in the lower part of his leg near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then, cut the skin with hooks and remove all the flesh from the vein until it appears to the sense: and at its appearance, what you see is that it reddens down to a dark color.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it goes out of the skin, you see it white as if it were a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then, put under it a radium until when evacuated and goes out of the skin: suspend it with a blind hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then, cut another section near that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then, remove the flesh from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then, evacuate it with radiums as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then, cut another section, or more sections, if you need it.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then incise, and make the final cut at the calcaneum.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove it to the cut that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And make it until you remove it from the cut that is above it, or from all higher cuts, until when it exits entirely: then incise it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If however it does not obey you in being removed and incised: then insert a sharp needle with strong thread doubled, and tie it, and remove it: or insert under it Radium: and turn your hand to all parts, until it exits.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it be incised.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is incised, it becomes difficult for you to remove it greatly, and enters above the weak from it harm.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have removed it entirely: then place on the wound a bandage soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	But if the Vitis is contracted, having twisting which is involution to parts, and is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you cut over it to all part of its twisting, and places of its involution.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you remove it entirely: and beware at your cut on it that you do not incise the vein, or wound: for difficult will become for you to remove, or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Form of the Incision which heals the Vitis.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The Form of the Involution of the Blind.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not to it straightness like other Involutions, nor is it sharp extremity, so that it does not incise the vein: and is thick flexuosity, gentle: because if it were subtle, it would incise the vein by its subtlety: indeed there is to it excessive thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Translation: On the Extraction of the Femoral Vein
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in warm lands, such as among the Alizegi and in Arabia, and in dry, warm lands with few greens, that is, where there are no plants or trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	Its generation indeed is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, like what happens inside bodies with snakes and vermin such as roundworms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the onset of this vein is that an intense inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the location is opened.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to exit from that location of opening, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore it appears from that end of it, then you must wrap over it a piece of lead, whose weight is from a drachma of keil, up to two drachmas and the knot: and let the lead be suspended from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something exits from it to the outsides, wrap that in lead and knot it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If however it is prolonged much, then cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it off root and branch before it exits entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it off, it contracts and enters into the flesh: and it causes an abscess, and putrefaction, and a bad wound in that location.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be gently handled, and drawn out gradually, until it exits from the last of itself, and nothing remains in the body from it: and from this vein exits in certain people which is in its length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now he has come to me because a man has died from an injury of 20 palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If you are suddenly faced with a medical situation: then insert the probe into the hole, and pierce it through the hole, with the body, until everything that is in it is evacuated from the matter: and treat the putrefaction of the wound with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the wound itself with the treatment of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and there are many openings for it, and a branch exits from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Then care for it as we said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	¶ On cutting for worms generated under the skin, and it is called "boil.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called "boil" in a certain land among us: because it often happens to boils, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes through the whole body, ascending and descending: and it shows itself to the senses during its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks wherever it breaks in the skin, and exits.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and tapeworms, do in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared from its harmfulness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it goes through the body, and is raised to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens in it, and exits, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure him and extract him, it is not done except during his walking and the appearance of himself to his sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, you must bind what is above him and what is below him with a strong constricting bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above him and extract him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it has gone deep into the flesh and you cannot find it, then place a hot iron over the spot until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater danger is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind under it a good eyebrow binding.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above him and extract him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And the sick person should use a cleaning of his body with remedies dissolving foul humors and bad things.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he should beware of foods that generate putrefaction in himself.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	¶ On cutting above the pain of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This pain is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain members, then it is transmitted from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have already seen it, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to an infirm woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she detached her arm, and I saw inflation of a small vein in the tendon of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after remaining for an hour, I saw one inflation going with a firebrand, like a snake, ascending to her shoulder faster than it could be: so that it was like live silver when it ran from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain went away from that place and fixed itself on her shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it was circulating throughout his entire body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was therefore amazed at the speed of its movement from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, I had not seen this sickness with my own eyes in this way before.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I had seen many who found pain moving from member to member, and I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in that woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is [so], except because the woman was from those who are from dry bodies of veins detected: hence therefore it appears to the senses that this movement is caused by that windiness.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate, and with humid bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to cure him, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to you by sight, as we said, then bind above it quickly, and underneath: and dry above it, until that windiness is confined: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your own eyes: then cure him with a shaking of the body, and with that which expels windiness, and carminate them with fetid pills, and pills of sarsaparilla, and similar ones.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	§ On the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows vary according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they fall out of the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Indeed their variety is [such] because among them are those which have large and small, and hollow and dull points.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those that have a tongue.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those that have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those indeed which are according to the members in which they fall, is according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For indeed the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar things.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any of these members, and the signs of death appear to you, which I tell you after, then it is necessary that you seek the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in which is, in many positions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when those evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For from the signs of the brain when it falls into him arrow, and penetrates the mouth, and goes out that which is above the brain, is: because they happen from it strong soda, and scotomia, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflation, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and mixture of intellect, and vomiting of choler.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps it goes out blood from the nostrils, or from the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps it cuts off speech, and destroys voice.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And it goes out from the place of the wound white fluid similar to pus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it goes out from that similar flowing of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore those signs appear to you, then abstain from care, and extract the arrow if it does not go out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	But the signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart, are: that itself is near the left nipple: and feels with it as if itself is fixed in a hard thing, not in a empty thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the motion of an arrow is similar to the motion of a blow: and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And then follows a chill in the extremities, and cold sweat, and convulsions.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Therefore know that death is certainly approaching.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it pierces the lung is the appearance of foamy blood from the wound: and the swellings that follow the neck become abscesses, and the color of the sick person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, deep breath: and seeks the cold draft of air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the lung, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is a great difficulty in breathing with intense pain, with sighs: and all the limbs of the arms move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food comes out of the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly, and it is stuck in it: something of feces comes out of the wound, or a stool, or an intestine that is already torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope of his cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out of it: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the sick person: then know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The other parts of the body, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and spine, and ribs, and backbone, and hip, and leg, and similar things from the limbs are saved according to many arrangements: when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve: and it is not a poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, as you indicate in your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	This is because a certain man had an arrow fall into his lacrimal duct, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore removed it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I could only extract its small end with it, with which it adheres to its reed: and it was a large arrow from the arrows of the Turks, with a blunt arrowhead, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I removed an arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	It was an Arabic arrow, and it has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I therefore cut it off above it between two ribs: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was careful with it as I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I removed an arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After therefore thirty days had passed over him, and nothing was changed on him from his dispositions, I cut above the arrow: and I punctured it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no harm came to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man on whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound was healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After therefore it had been for seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	I saw a woman who had an arrow pierce her womb, and the wound was healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and there was no change in her posture or condition, and she did not find any harm from her natural bodily functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	I also saw a man who had an arrow pierce his face: and the wound was healed over it, and he did not find much pain from it: and there were many similar cases like this.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	I also extracted an arrow from a man from the Prince's household, which had pierced him in the middle of his nose, and it had already begun to decline towards the right side a little bit: and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called for his treatment after the arrow incident for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the wound of the arrow to be quite tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore examined it with a fine probe, and I did not feel it: but he himself found the pricking and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that this was the pricking from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore applied the plaster in the place where there was the power of attraction and digestion, confident that the wound would become an abscess and I would see a sign of the arrow so that I could cut it off: and nothing unexpected happened in the location to indicate that the arrow had followed the location.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I therefore applied the plaster to him daily for many days: and nothing unexpected happened, and the wound healed in between: and he remained weak from its extraction for a few days, until he felt the arrow inside his nose on a certain day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about it.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I therefore placed a sharp and corrosive medicine on that wound for many days until it became open: and when I examined him again with a fine probe, I felt the tip of the arrow which was sticking to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the visible end of the arrow appeared to us: and it passed by me with it a certain period of time, approximately four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert pliers into it and move it, but it did not obey and exit: then I did not cease to sharpen and ingeniously work on it with various methods of craftsmanship, until I began on a certain day with pliers made well according to the form they will have in the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed the doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it, and the wound was healed and solidified, and the sick man was made healthy with complete health: and nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of extracting certain arrows: so that you may place that rule and signification on that which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood with the narration: nor does that book comprehend it, and the wise craftsman compares with little over much: and with that which is present, over that which is absent: and he found a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of things extraneous to this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not exit from the members in which they are fixed, except according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or from the opposite part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and it is attracted and exited.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not comply with the outcome from the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary to let it go for several days, until the flesh that is around it rots: and its attraction is alleviated, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it sticks to the bone, and does not comply with you for exit, then let it go also for several days: and repeat it with attraction and motion every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not comply with you for exit after days: then it is necessary to drill in the circumference of the arrow in the very bone from all parts with a fine awl, until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already proceeded into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents that I mentioned appear: then abstain from attracting the arrow, and let it go, until it is equal to its condition after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sinus, then death is not prolonged to it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, but only in the body of the bone, and does not penetrate up to the sinus: and he remains infirm for several days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him: then use skill in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed very much, and does not comply with you for attracting: then administer drills in the circumference of the arrow, as I told you: then care for the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sensation: then seek it with probing.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then attract it with some instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot apply a bandage over the wound due to its constriction and length of the arrow in a deep place where there is no bone, nerve, or vein, then prick the wound until it expands and make it possible to remove the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If there are ears to which the arrow is attached, then free the fixed flesh from all sides and in every way you can, and if it cannot be removed from the break in the ear and their twisting, continue until it dissolves.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of the arrow in any place, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps to all parts until you make it dissolve: and with subtlety, subtly, so that the arrow is not broken and it becomes difficult for you to attract it and its removal.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot apply it in one hour, then leave it for several days until the surrounding parts decay.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for the tunica will be healed if it causes contradiction to you of blood flow, then administer what we said from the cure in its chapter: and guard your virtue from incision of vein, or nerve, or chord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer your ingenuity in every way that is possible for you to dissolve the arrow: and it should be with ease, tranquility, slowness, and firmness, as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do when you pull the arrow, that it be weak according to its figure, as it was at the accident of the arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If it is not possible for you to do that, then administer what is possible from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow that exits from the opposite part, or has already begun to protrude from it, does something to the exterior: either it causes a bony prominence at the tip of the arrow due to the proximity of the upper layer of skin, which you see sticking out; therefore, cut it off and make the incision according to the amount that the forceps can grasp in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out: indeed, it becomes easy to extract.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If indeed it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow is impressed into the bone and expands itself: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for several days; then repeat it, until it exits.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the shaft of the arrow is in it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the shaft has fallen off, and you wish to administer an impulse: then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters into the tail of the arrow: then push it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is concave, then push it with the inserted instrument.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For indeed, the arrow is relieved by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary, that you concave the entire flesh in which the poison is: if it is possible for you to do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for it with what is suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	But if the arrow is falling into the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is close to that which you touch with the tent, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of the incision of the vein, or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then tend to his wound, if you see it, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the shape of forceps, by which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let their ends be similar to the beak of a bird, which are made like iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many shapes are made from them, large and small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its length, and the depth and width of the wound, and its contraction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the pusher is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the pusher is dull.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the dull end of the pusher like a radius, so that its entrance into the concave arrow is eased, and it is pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of this pusher is concave is concave like the beak of a bird: so that its entrance into the arrow is eased, and its impact.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On bloodletting from veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter 97.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins to be bloodlet from, which have become accustomed to the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of which there are sixteen in the head: two pulsatile veins that are behind the ears, called the "herbs": and two arteries, which are visible in two temples: and two veins that are in the two lacrimal ducts of both eyes, which are called "aspiring": and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead: and a vein at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two jugular veins, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins that are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	These are veins that are called Al-Jichir.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And there are two veins that are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	However, the veins that are being bled in the arms, there are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is called the Cephalic vein, and it is on the lateral side of the arm; and the people call it the head vein.
Et Fusca.	And the Dark one.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And there is a Medium vein, and it is composed of the branch of the Basilica vein, and the branch of the Cephalic vein; and the people call it the body vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the Basilica vein, and it is placed on the inner side of the arm; and it is also called the Titillacarus.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And the people call it the abdominal vein.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the Cord of the arm, and it is placed on the forearm; and it is the one in which bleeding is done, and it is the one that appears above the thumb with a clear palm.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the Salivate vein: and it is a vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger; and there are two branches to it.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And in the leg and in the foot, there are three veins.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is the one that is under the curvature of the thumb on the lateral side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second is the Saphena: and its location is next to the heel on the inner side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And the vein Nesse: and its location is next to the heel on the lateral side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And in the leg, there are other three veins similar to those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	§ On bleeding from two veins after the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Indeed, the bleeding of two veins that are after the ears is a remedy for ancient catarrhs, and hemicrania, and sahafati, and old head sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	The quality of bloodletting, as I mentioned earlier, is as follows.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is to be done by cutting the head of the sick person: and the back of his head is to be rubbed with a rough cloth in the place of two veins, with good friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then the sick person ties his neck with a ligature, until two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel them pulsating under your finger, there mark them with cauterization.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take the phlebotomy knife, and it is called "Incidens".
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then insert it under the vein into the skin, until the phlebotomist reaches the bone.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then elevate your hand with the vein and skin towards the upper part, and cut the vein with the skin incision "Incidens".
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be the width of two fingers, or about that: and let out as much blood as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then tie it with bandages, and let it go, until he is healed.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And it has already preceded at the beginning of the book, its incision and cauterization.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	About bloodletting from two arteries during certain times.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	Of the two arteries which are in two times of bloodletting, the remedy is for the ancient hemigrape: and a bad salt, and an abundant suppurant: and the course of superfluous sharp fluids to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of bloodletting them is as follows, as I told you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	The sick person ties his neck very tightly, until two veins appear clearly to the sense: and the pulse of them is shown under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then, indeed, with cauterization.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then, you should lift the skin above the vein towards the upper part with your index finger, and insert a phlebotomy needle from below, and lift the vein towards the upper part.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it, as you did in the other two veins: and make it bleed according to the amount of your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then, dissolve the tightness of the weak [vein], and place your finger on the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then, place a cloth and lint on it, and tie it above with a strong compression: and let it go, until it is healed.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And the memory of them, their cutting, and their extraction have already been mentioned at the beginning of this book.

Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore cut both with an incision entering.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if doubt is upon you, and you do not know which of them is: then direct to the incision of the larger ones, and their more manifest.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	§ On bloodletting of Vein under the tongue after Cephalic bloodletting.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Of the two veins that are under the tongue bloodletting is a remedy: because Cephalic bloodletting is for prevention of those which are in the throat, and pain of the throat, and pains of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of bloodletting them is that the sick person should sit between your hands in front of the sun: and elevate their tongue, and look under the tongue from one side a vein, and from the other side a vein: and the color of each declining to blackness.

Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under them are arteries, and perhaps it may happen flow of blood from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	§ On the three veins in the arm.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	Three veins are tapped for bloodletting in the arm, and this practice has become customary in all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And bloodletting from these is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad-bladed myrtle knife: or by oiliness to the subtlety of the incline: or by cutting with a scalpel knife, and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is, which suits for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these are species broad and subtle according to the width and tightness of the veins. The form of the myrtle knife is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it suits for opening deep, full, protruding, visible, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this knife is of less width and more subtle at the tip.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it suits for bloodletting from thin veins that contain thin, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On bloodletting of the basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The basilica, which is one of these three veins' jewel, is a treasure.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, from the chest and belly, and because the bloodletting follows it, therefore the bloodletter with this knife should be careful and have great fear of it, for under it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore if he errs and adds to the bloodletting puncture, he will cut that artery, and a blood loss will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary not to bloodlet with this knife when pricking, but rather to cut with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the Basilica does not appear clearly in an apparition, then you should exchange it with another, or seek out a branch of it: or perform bloodletting at the place of the arm's cord.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For indeed it is clear, and dry it with a leech (phlebotomo Anesil), as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to perform bloodletting on it, then you should do so before the stricture of the arm, touching the place until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with a hot iron, then the arm, and dry the vein by hollow cutting with a leech (phlebotomo Alnesil), as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware that the blow does not fall over the distance from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tie the bandage, swelling in the place that you marked with a hot iron, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore remove it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood coming out at the bloodletting, like the urine of a child, and it is thin and red blood, then you know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore hurry, and place your finger on it for a long distance, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is cut off (for often it is cut off), then tie the arm, and let it go: and beware that the weak one is not moved from its motion: and let it be on its fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for several days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not cut off, and it binds you: and there is no medicine present for you in your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	The extremities of it contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the horn of a rhinoceros, and pierce it: take half of it, and bind it over the place of the vein's binding, with a bandage and cotton until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then care for it with the one who preceded its remembrance from the place of dust removing the flow of blood: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many positions, because of the small wound's place, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the vein's fistula.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	However, the fistula for the vein's phlebotomy is a tool that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower body: because it is composed of the branch of the Basilicus, and the branch of the Cephalic, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that it be above fear from its phlebotomy, because under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds in the puncture of the phlebotomist, and finds a nerve, it happens to her stupor, and difficult is its healing, and perhaps she is not healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and does not show: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where the phlebotomy, section with Alnesil, and separation of the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then pierce the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	The translation of "De uena Cephalican" from medieval Latin is "On the Central Incisor Tooth.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The translation of "Phlebotomiae autem uena Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum" from medieval Latin is "The central incisor tooth is a remedy for phlebotomy, as it draws blood from the head and is useful for eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	The translation of "Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus" from medieval Latin is "It is proper to use this tooth for phlebotomy by pricking it with a lancet or a myrtle needle, as it is safer than all other teeth because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	The translation of "Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens" from medieval Latin is "However, it is proper for you to use a lancet to prick the tail of a lizard during phlebotomy and search for a softer spot, and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first blow, but can be repeated with phlebotomy several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	The translation of "Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo" from medieval Latin is "However, it may abscess in some people when it is not pricked with the first blow, but it does not harm them with that abscess somewhere else.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	The translation of "¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis" from medieval Latin is "On the Usefulness of Phlebotomy and Precautions to be Observed in It.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The translation of "Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare" from medieval Latin is "The nature and accidents of phlebotomy, and how to correct them, is what you should think about.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, you should know that bloodletting is not administered unless for the preservation of health and its continuity, and as a precaution against the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that bloodletting can be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, Fusca, and Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that bloodletting can be performed at the beginning of spring on a fasting day, in the summer, and in the winter: and in the autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And bloodletting should be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed since the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, bloodletting that is administered during illnesses does not have a determined time: but when the appropriateness and necessity for it arise at night or during the day, and at every hour, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not appropriate for children to undergo bloodletting until they reach the age of fourteen.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman undergo bloodletting except from the fourth month until the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	And elders who have already passed sixty years of age should not undergo bloodletting.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone wants to undergo bloodletting for any reason at all, it is necessary for them to cleanse their intestines beforehand with a mild enema if there is much feces retained in them: so that the veins during bloodletting do not draw out superfluous putrid substances harmful to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	And the person who is suffering from toctina, that is, a nauseous feeling of fullness, nor the overfed, nor one avoiding drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor with one who is weak due to hydrocephalus.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bleeding should be avoided again after colic pain, vomiting, diarrhea, frequent intercourse, labor, exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and everything that dissolves strength from the body or the animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him to have that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he should enter the bath, if nothing prohibits him: or he should be exercised with some exercise, so that the blood is thinned.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place bleeding of his in the chest, around the third day, as we said: and try, that his chest is emptied on that day from all animal misfortunes: such as distress, anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and punishment, and superfluity, and the like.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let his seat be present with those things of which custom has run from usage of men from aromatics, and perfume, and dancing and the like by quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the bleeder should sit on a bed, which is higher than the bed of the bleeding: then he should draw his arm, and rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should tie the ligament with a bandage, and cover it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the bandage be tempered, because when the bandage is unequal, or by superfluity in the bandage, then it prevents the course of blood: or in mollification, then also prevents the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after bandaging, it is necessary that the bleeder should rub his hands simultaneously on him until the veins swell and disappear from sensation.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the bleeder washes off the cupping glass with a little oil, as is proper.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his finger, the index finger of his left hand, on the vein under the spot where he wants to perform the cupping, not too much: so that the vein does not escape, and the blow is contained.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from the veins is what you find as a string escaping at cupping: and from them is what is full of puffiness: and when you place the cup on it, it contracts under the cup, and deceives the bleeder, and does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is tight: for this reason therefore it is necessary that the bleeder be firm, and be careful in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should remove the cup.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened from one strike, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that stroke at another spot under that place not too much, or above it with haste: if the place does not become inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	But if it becomes inflamed, or the weak person swells, then let him go on the day, or on two days: and do not bind the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps the inflammation will attract hot.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And he should not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he should repeat cupping, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	But if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly: and you fear that not enough quantity of blood will come out as you wish: then repeat cupping in the same hole according to straightness, and add a little in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with haste, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is in many people at small operations.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see that it is already suppurating, then you should not touch it at all, for nothing excuses it in your presence.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something on it from the oil dregs, as it will soothe the course of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than the other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	Similarly, administer the oil dregs in all your bloodletting, where the bleeding is prohibited from the course of the blood: and they make it the Tyrian balm, and sagzenea, when placed on one of them on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	But if an abscess occurs in the place of bloodletting, for it often happens, especially to those who are not bloodlet from that time, or is a small opening of the vein, then hurry and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and tie it for an hour: for it will dissolve.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And you should do this after the blood has exited from the vein itself, with its own supplement, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	But if something remains in the place after a few days of blackness or greenness, it does not harm that: and if you wish, place on it something aloe, or myrrh solubles: or something from the mint juice, that is, calamint or similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	But often indeed abscesses and swellings occur at bloodletting of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Then place your hand on it, then if you find softness at the compression of your hand on it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, take something from what we said and place it on it.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps the blood flows from that of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But apply a plaster to it with what has stopping power, so that the wound may harden.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for that itself with the other cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary, to extract all blood from every man according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color staining the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out, until it becomes red: and similarly if you see it is thick, then let it go out, until it becomes thin: and similarly if it is sharp, then let it be removed, until its sharpness is taken away.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs extraction of blood once, so that the phlebotomy of the vein may be increased, and he may be a side-bleeder: and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary, that he may extract it at intervals, and that there be a narrow opening: and better what is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein is, that it be transverse section, not puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the incision of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is customary to arrive at phlebotomy with syncopes, it is necessary that he may eat before the phlebotomy, a little bread soaked in water of pomegranate: or secanibin, if he is heated: and extract from him from the blood in three intervals, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before the phlebotomy bread soaked in syrup of myrrh, or in syrup of honey flavored with species, or in aromatic syrup fragrant.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If it happens that a syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and the cause is multiple exits of blood, then it is necessary for him to take water of flesh and fragrant syrup: and to use aromatics with algalia, and to bind his chest with that: and to use the other things that we mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	However, if one wants to heal his arm and dissolve his blood secondly: then it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and whose virtue is weak, that he dissolves the blood gradually through the quantity of virtue in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	However, if one wants to heal his arm and dissolve his blood secondly, and his body is strong: then he should do it after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	However, if one wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite part of which he leans: then it is necessary for him to heal on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body indeed the blood is already much heated, and sharpened, and makes fever to happen: then it is necessary for him that the blood goes out from him in one draft, and a large quantity is taken from him: and the opening is amplified until it happens syncope: after you have been saving all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you place your hand on the bleeding at the course of the blood, so that death does not happen in the place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For often it happens when the phlebotomist is unaware, and negligence falls.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when one wants to heal the arm, and dissolve the blood secondly, since already the opening of the vein is closed, and difficult exit of the blood is made, that it be hastily put on top of him with force, and the cure be extended quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a great evil, but let it go until it is bled again in the second place.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with sharpness of the bleeding instrument that which has coagulated from blood in the vein's opening, and place on it something salted in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place on it something from the Tyrian alfarech, or sagzenia, and place it with gentle compression until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if indeed the vein has already become an abscess, then let it go, and do not bandage it until the abscess is formed.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity provokes to dissolve blood again in the second place, and there is no excuse, then either by bleeding instrument on that place, or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the arm's vein is bled at the place of the Fusca, and the Basilica, since they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its bleeding is that the weak hand inserts itself in hot water, until it reddens easily, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is bandaged over it with a bandage of moderate compression.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the bleeding instrument is passed according to transudation gradually, not horizontally, nor according to length: and let the opening be wide, and let your bleeding be on the junction of the hand for a moment.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	But if the exit of blood is forbidden, then repeat the hand in hot water, and let the blood run in the water, until you achieve your necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in days of summer, then you will be excused from repetition of the hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	Indeed, the course of blood is particularly emphasized in warm water during wintertime.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, as there is no pulsating vessel nor nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	In fact, the phlebotomy of the left hand's palm is beneficial for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that you should tie the arm with a bandage or your hand, after you have inserted it into warm water, until the vein is punctured and a significant sensation is felt.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then, the phlebotomy should be continued by turning the arm.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you completely puncture it, it will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And do not save, but with your last hand and the phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood will coagulate in the vein opening and prevent its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you have extracted a quantity of blood necessary from the vein, then place oil and salt on it: so that it does not coagulate quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is necessary to do with every tightly bound branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The remedy of this phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is beneficial for spleen ailments; and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The remedy of the saphenous phlebotomy is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine ailments, retention of menstrual flow, and kidney weaknesses, and ancient ulcers of the hip and thigh, and similar ailments from ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	The quality of the phlebotomy is that the sick person should put his foot in warm water and perform friction on it until the veins are full, and then tie above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	Indeed, the veins are located near the heel, facing the big toe, and branch out from there into many branches in the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, perform phlebotomy on a larger branch of it or near the heel in its collection, as it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If phlebotomy is performed on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are under it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy where the phlebotomy is from the transverse, as if you wanted to cut it: and let the phlebotomy be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the outlet of the blood is forbidden, then repeat friction on his foot in warm water: and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the vein is missed by the phlebotomist in the first attempt, then repeat with phlebotomy to the upper part, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it when you are careful of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the other Saphena of the foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the veins of the Sciatic are, as we said, located near the heel on the lateral side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the indication for phlebotomy of it is for pain in the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter the bath quickly and firmly, and bind his leg from the side of the ankle up to above the heel with four fingers, with a thin strip of cloth: for it does not appear otherwise than because of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it is visible, then the lancet should be used according to whatever skill is possible for you, or according to transversion: and it is better, either by incising it with an incision, or by separating it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its place is safer, and it is hidden to a great extent in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it is not at all visible to the senses: then the lancet should be used on some part of it, and that is the one which appears in the back of the foot, and towards the auricular: and beware of the nerves, and make it bleed from the quantity of blood that you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then dissolve the constriction, and place the skin on the place of lancetting, and tie the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it is healed quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning ventilation, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventilations are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And ventilation is indeed done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With incision, and extraction of blood: and the other is ventilation without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventilation which is without incision, is according to two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	For indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventilations which are administered with incision and extraction of blood, are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the ventilation of Alnocrati, and it is the last of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the ventilations of Alhagdahim, and they are two layers of the neck from two parts at the same time: and the ventilation of the mouth, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the ventilation of the two spatulas: and the ventilation of the Alachosos on the end of the tail: and the ventilation of the two focilium, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and the ventilation of the two crura: and the ventilation of the two cauillarum.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	Indeed, suction (ventosatio) does not draw blood from your wounds, which are scattered in the flesh, and for this reason, its power does not diminish, unlike the case of phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not necessary to apply suction (ventosatio) whether with or without fire in any ailment that arises from overfullness, until the entire body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity arises from an ailment or custom to apply suction (ventosatio), we administer it at every hour of the first day of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	Because there are people who when their blood multiplies within them, until they need its extraction through suction (ventosatio), find in their head heaviness and sores.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from them is found overfullness and redness in their face, on their head, and on their neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from them is found itching in their face, and on their forehead, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from them is found sweating at the place of their suction (ventosatio).
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from him is found increased laughter.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from them is found a taste of blood in their mouth: or their tongue swells and discharges blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from him is found increased sleep.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from them is seen in their sleep blood and redness, and killed, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something from them, and it is properly in the middle of the third month: we command then that suction (ventosatio) be done after they have passed two or three hours past midday.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The remedy for ventosation of the neck is: since it contributes to heaviness in the head, and what is poured out affects the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	Indeed, it should be done after complete evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	This is indeed the place for cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed to use this for those who have a cold constitution, or in one who has a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it causes them great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And therefore, it is not appropriate for the elderly, and those in whose head there are cold complaints.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But he who becomes too accustomed to it, develops a forgetfulness upon him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore, you should advise the ventosator to put his hand with the ventosa briefly on the lower parts, fearing from the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosation or alcohol, is the place for phlebotomy of the femoral vein, and phlebotomy of the basilic vein, and because of this it causes asphyxia, and constriction of breathing, and tearing of the instrument of breathing, and coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it should be applied briefly, because if it is placed lower, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosation of alhagdahim indeed, causes pain from accidental headaches, and obtalmiae, and hemigraneae, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is the place for phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you should advise the ventosator not to press his hand on the scarification: so that he does not puncture the artery, and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventilation under the chin, applies alcohol to the mouth, and prevents corruption of the jaw and similar afflictions that occur in the mouth: and it is a suitable place for bleeding, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventilation of the spoons, applies to alcohol, which is made by folding and heating.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Indeed, ventilation of the inner parts of the two arms, applies to the bandage of bleeding from the three veins, Basilicae, Fuscae, and Cephalicae: because it attracts blood from all the small veins that are in the flesh: and the small veins attract from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary to command the Ventosator not to proceed too far in incision: because the place is denuded of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The Ventosator that ventilates on the spoons, applies to hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary to command the Ventosator that it be large and made of air: because the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the thin Ventosae are broken: and incision is made with a large incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The Ventosae of the legs reduce manifest diminution: because they attract blood from the whole body, and apply to old pains in the kidneys, and matrices, and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and apply to bothor, and ademenul: and they stand in the place of bleeding from the two saphenar veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body a lot, and cause syncope to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the joint of the thigh is close to the joint of two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The position of the thigh is such that you should place the thigh in a first vacuum and with controlled suction: and do not prolong the position of the thighs, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with equal approach: and do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the place already red and inflated, and the appearance of blood redness: then therefore scarify, and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the position of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For who is of the men is of tender flesh, rarely porously, it is necessary that you scarify him once, not more: so that the place does not hurt.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And command the thigh to enlarge the scarification and to penetrate slightly: and regulate suction in facility, speed, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a swelling in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first juice indeed opens the narrow way of the subtlety of blood and its humidity: and in the second indeed the exact investigation of the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is very foul, then a third scarification should be made: so that it follows the last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And at last, when we want to extract blood gradually or slightly, one scarification is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If indeed we want the extraction of blood many times, we should scarify with many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that he be scarified with a deep scarification: and the equal end in the scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which should be administered from oils at the position of the Winds, and what should the one winding up avoid?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	Indeed, if the skin is rough, hard, dark, and its pores are narrow, one should anoint the areas of the Winds with open, gentle, and resolving oils at the position of the Winds: if it is in the time of summer, as is the oil of aleppo, or the violated oil, or the oil of sweet apricot kernels, or the oil of cucurbita seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then the oil of narcissus, or the oil of lily, or the oil of camaelle, or sarbatin: and similar to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If indeed the excess is rough and cold, then the oil should be amaracus, or the oil of balsamita, or the white oil, or the oil of aneth: and similar to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If indeed the one winding up is of large pores, and of tender flesh, then it should be prohibited from oil, and these should clean the areas of the Winds with rosewater, or with cold water, or with the water of solatria, or with the water of cucurbita, or with the water of portulaca: and similar to these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But the one whose blood is of much moisture, should clean the areas of the Winds with vinegar, or with the water of myrtle and sumach: and similar to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But the one whose excesses are rough, should clean the areas of the Winds with old wine, or with the water of sambucus, or the decoction of aneth, or chamomile: and similar to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it should be avoided that winding up is in the bath, or at the foot of the bath, but it should be administered after exiting from the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary for someone to sleep after sneezing.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is the reason why one should be bled or undergo venesection before sneezing?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, it is necessary to consider first of all: if the person has been bled or undergone venesection and is choleric, then sharpness and inflammation are added to their blood: then they should take cooling remedies, such as pomegranate bark: and also with vinegar and lettuce, and soda and juniper: and similar remedies.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And they should take their food in the form of chicken eggs, and meat of young animals, and condimented foods with asafetida: and similar remedies.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if their constitution is cold, they should take in a drink syrup of honey, or of almonds, or of juniper made from seeds: and they should take aromatic wine of medium strength, which is between old and new: and they should be advised to use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And they should take their food in the form of chicken eggs, and cane sugar: and small birds, that is, little birds: and young pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of sneezing and bleeding should be more than the food: and it is necessary to give in the drink to some people at certain hours tyrian alfaroch, or medicine made from musk, that is, musk, or aleselith before sneezing: and before bleeding, or after: so that the main members are strengthened, and the blood is thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary for them to take it in a warm drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	¶ On Sneezing without Scarrification
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Wounds that are not accompanied by incision, are ventosae wounds which are placed on the ear, spleen, podagra, abdomen, umbilicus, and areas of the kidneys, and the perineum: because these parts do not allow incision to be made on them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And nothing is sought through them, except for the contact of blood from a member to a member: as we place ventosae on the breasts in illness of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to drain cold ventosity from a member that has become cold and wet: as we place ventosae on the abdomen, and umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For indeed they rarefy the member, and warm it, and remove pain because they have dissolved that ventosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	They are also placed on the kidneys when there is a stone or rock in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For indeed by their own attractive power perhaps they open the obstruction, or remove the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when it is placed on the ear, and spleen, for draining ventosity from both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these ventosae are administered empty with incision alone.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full with warm water in pleurisy: and this is so that the ventosae be filled, and be large, with hot water alone, or water in which herbs have been boiled that are suitable.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of ventosae administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its mouth be two open fingers wide, according to how we have shaped it: and let its depth be half a palm: and on its side in a place that is roughly in the middle of it, there should be a small hole, according to the size that the needle goes through: let it be made of air, or yellow wax, of rough edges, of linen, of equal thickness, of cleansed: so that it does not harm the member at its position on top of it: and let there be in the middle of it a transverse rod of air, or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this sponge becomes very large and much larger than we have described, and somewhat smaller than the previous one, according to the illness and age of the person who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For boys and thin people, there are other sponges that are not as large as those for men and people with larger bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this large sponge on the burnt member with fire is as follows: one should light the linen cloth with fire in a decent manner, or a small candle made of clay: and place it on the middle of the twisted rope that is in the middle of the sponge, so that the fire may be placed around the lower part of the sponge, so as not to burn the body of the weak.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it on the member: and the finger should be on the hole that I said, until we hold the sponge: while we need it, we remove the finger, and steam comes out of that hole, and the sponge dissolves immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the linen cloth according to its usual manner, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the sponge that is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no twisted rope, nor hole: and it is not administered unless because the water is full, and it is placed on the member only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this sponge, the larger it is, the better it is to hold much water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ On the suspension of Bloodletting Cups.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodletting cups are not administered in many places, unless in those where it is impossible to place the sponges, due to their size, such as the lip, and the jaw, and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in the member bare of flesh, such as the finger, and the nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you go from bloodsuckers which are in sweet waters, clean from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be released day and night into sweet water, until the bloodsuckers are hungry, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body will be purified first with bloodletting, and with vomiting.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wipe the weak member until it reddens.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards they will be placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are full and fall, and it is possible to suck the location with vomiting, then it is more final in the cure: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and rub, and express.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood extends after the death of bloodsuckers, and it is that dripping: then pour linen cloth into cold water, and place it on top, until the dripping is cut off.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood increases, then powder on top of it sage leaves crushed, or galbanum, and similar things from stoptics: until the blood is cut off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they will be placed on top of the location of half-peeled beans: and they will be released, until the beans stick in the place, because the blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if it is necessary to repeat the bloodsuckers, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if bloodsuckers are prevented from hanging, then wash the place with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fix a needle in the places, until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they will be placed, because when they feel something from the blood, they stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you wish for them to fall out, sprinkle powder on them from a crushed aloe, or salt, or ash: and they will fall out immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	¶ Universal Speech on the Restoration, Dislocation, and Cure of Sprains, and Similar Matters.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations that occur in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O children, that foolish physicians and the common people, and those who have never examined the ancient book nor read a letter from it, boast about this chapter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is deprived of our knowledge on earth.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never boasted in it at all, and I have not obtained from it that which I have obtained unless for the length of reading ancient books and the study beyond understanding them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to it by experience and study throughout the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you in this chapter all that it contains of my knowledge: and after my experience passed over it, after I abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the burden of length, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and showed it at the end of declination: and I formed many forms in it from the forms of instruments that are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declination, just as I did in two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	¶ Summary and collections from the existence of bone fractures, from those that their preliminary mention is necessary before we begin the remembrance of the limbs of the broken and various, if each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	In the prologue of this chapter, we must say some basic words and headings that require understanding in order to reach the truth of these matters: namely, so that you and those who are ready know, or learn, this noble art, and others from us.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say therefore that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twist, or accident happens to someone: then it is necessary to proceed first to bleeding him, and to dissolving him, or both at once: if nothing prevents, such as weakness of strength: or he is one of those who are very old, or decrepit: or it is a time of very intense heat, or very intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food, with cool spices, and meat of birds, and of sheep: and prohibit wine, and coarse meat, and to be filled with food and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when he is secure from the hot abscess, and does not fear the flow of matter to the member: then the sick person should return to his first diet with which he was used to custom.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore the broken jaw begins to be restored, then it is necessary for the sick person to be fed with nutritious food in great abundance, coarse, heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as food made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and meat, and feet, and bellies of cattle, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar to those.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For this diet makes the healing of the fracture faster, and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that when bones are fractured in men who are in their first old age, and the decrepit, it is not possible for them to be continuously and consolidated according to their natural nature always, because of the dryness of their members: and they are consolidated and continued what is from them at the end of lenity, as bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches something similar to glue to the fractured bone from all parts, which contains a certain thickness that adheres and binds it together, until they are gradually united and bound together again, until it comes to the end of its strength and firmness, just as it was in the beginning, until something does not prevent it from performing its functions: for this reason, it is necessary to place nourishment for the weak foods, in which there is heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you should know that the appearance of fractures is different according to the diversity of the members: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the ribs is different from a fracture of the backbone: and similarly, all other members are different from one another: and I come with the remembrance of all the species of fractures explained in their respective chapters distinct from one another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	The species of bone fracture also vary within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Since it can be broken into a curved shape, apart from what happens to it in the form of stars.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes the fracture of it is according to the length of the bone: and its splinters, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as are in a reed when it is fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and it is a small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And there is a proper skill or tool for the restoration of each species, according to which the remembrance of it will come, distinct in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from the fact that the fracture of the bone is known, there is its crookedness and its prominence: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you grasp it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When there is no apparent twisting in the location, nor does a noise occur when you touch the bone with agitation, and no significant pain is found in the weak person: then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there may be a slight crack or twist. Therefore, it is not necessary to move it with your hand and compress it entirely, but rather place something soft on it from the medicines, of which mention is made, that fits the location: then it should be bound tightly with a thin bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the location is bent and torn into two, apart from what happens to it, nevertheless all part of its own is removed: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to rectify it, equaling it before it occurs to it a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a hot abscess occurs to it, then let it go for several days, until the abscess is quiet.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equal it according to whatever way can be done from the alleviation and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it, and its equaling, is easier than bone, in which happenings occur to it.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what comes to your memory of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if the happenings are in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this member of the broken one from two parts, if the hand is, or the foot: or with your hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position should be where you place the member on the equal location, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try to make those additions all with skill, and according to whatever way you can in their places: and beware according to your strength, so that pain does not occur to the weak person through your operation, nor injury: and try according to your strength, to apply one of two bones with its joint, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	In that hour, you must attempt and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and make it even by the amount of your virtue.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of strong extension and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often cause harm by their operation, a hot abscess or contraction in the limb: as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect after the equalization and proper operation, the tightness of that limb, and its quiet and tranquility: and warn the weak one on it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him be careful, not to move it in his own hours of vigilance, and his sleep, its rotation, its agitation, and its emission, and all its movements by his last virtue.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And let him be careful, that the position of the limb is not a position from which pain will follow.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain in the position of the limb, or injury: then it is necessary to change it to a different position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And let him be careful with it, that that position is equal, straight: so that when the limb is restored, twisting will not occur in it.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the tightness of the broken limb is as I say.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that broken limbs differ in their size, and their magnitude, and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which therefore from them are small, such as the arm, and finger, and foot, and similar to them, then it is necessary to be a wrapping of soft cloth, thin.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But which from them are large, such as the thigh, and leg, then it is necessary to be a wrapping of wide, hard cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament connects the large member and binds it from every part with equal tension, so that it does not enter it with a stain.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after your evacuation, place a suitable liniment on the equation after it, on the soft towel over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to roll the ligament over the place of the fracture itself with three or four rolls, according to what the member deserves: and bind your hand a little with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and bind less than your previous binding, by which you bound the place of the fracture.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then lengthen yourself with the roll from the place of the fracture for a little, and soften the binding gradually, until you take out a great thing from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another clean one, and roll it again over the place of the fracture with rolls.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then go with the roll to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And your operation should be in the binding of the roll and its softening, according to what we said in the first roll above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the rolls a soft towel or cloth with which the twisting of the fracture is equal, if there is twisting in it: and if not, you will not place anything on it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then roll over that other clean one.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then immediately after these well-made stars, if there is no inflation or hot abscess in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is inflation or abscess in it, then place on it what sits that abscess and removes the inflation: and leave it for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie around that one star.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the stars should be made from the flat, smooth pieces of bamboo, or from the cribbas made from pine or palm branches, or calingi: and the size of all the stars should be according to this form, and in this same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the star placed on the tractus should be slightly thicker and wider than the other stars, and the length of the star should be according to what fits the member in terms of size and shape.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie around the stars with another thread, according to the first tightness.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie over it with threads in a proper manner, as we said about the tightness: and it is that your tightness should be more above the place of the fracture: and the further it is from the fracture, the less the tightness.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads should be of medium thickness and thinness, and they should be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I saw from the operation of stupid people who use their own threads made from twisted linen, it is a great mistake: for the tightness falls outside of its quality with them.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads do not come together again: for you will not gather through the tightness with them what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there should be less than a finger between the stars and the stars.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the weak one is injured by the ends of the stars after the tightness in healthy places, then put under them soft wool or dyed wool until nothing is injured from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	But when there is a fracture with a wound, and disruption in the skin occurs, I will come back to it with a remembrance of it in the chapter according to its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb should be bound with stitches from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Because when a limb is large, it is not necessary to place stitches on it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your caution from the occurrence of hot abscesses.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters used by ancients, which are placed on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	¶ The common method of the plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many constitutions, especially women and children, because it is made of that which does not bind with heat, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you take from the dust of the millstone, and it is the marrow of the flour which hangs in the walls of the mill by the movement of the millstone: and make it thus, except that you grind it with the husk: and place the confection of it not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	¶ Another method of the plaster, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take of almess, and laudanum, and acacia, and enulae, and mugath: and suc, each ʒ X myrrhae, and both aloes ana ʒ V and alethil ʒ XX they are all ground, and sifted, and mixed with water alethil: or with the husk if the constitution of the patient is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For indeed it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and it binds to many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	¶ Another method of the plaster, which also binds a fracture and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe for mugwort, and mess (a type of herb), and white alum, of all equal parts 10 grains of myrrh, and of both kinds of aloes 5 grains, of acacia 6 grains, of Armenian bole 20 grains. They should all be well ground together, sifted, and made into a powder with water, or with egg white: and they should be administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Method of applying a plaster to joinings, and separated bones from their places: and it soothes the pain caused by them, and the wound of the bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take cut wool, and immerse it in vinegar, and boiled oil: and place it on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no power of healing, but it is good for the sedation of hot abscesses: and it expels pain properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Method of applying a plaster to heal a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of a wild fig, and the leaves of a wild papyrus: and grind all of them, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Method of applying a shortened plaster to heal a broken bone: and when you want the resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe for the root of white alum, and chamomile, and flowers of violets, and flour of herbs, of all equal parts 1: they should all be ground together, and made into a powder with wine, if it is not a heated member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	But if indeed it is heated, then make it into a powder with water of coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of applying a stronger plaster for the resolution, than this first one, when an hard abscess occurs at the healing of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe for the roots of althaea, and the seeds of linseed, and balm, and melilot, and safflower, and violets, and chamomile, of each one ounce, they should all be pounded, and then mixed with either willow water, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of that according to the warmth of the member, and the peacefulness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that a plaster should be placed on the broken member during its restoration, unless it is made from pitch and oil: nothing else; and he narrated that it should be between the thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen indeed saw that things should be placed on the broken member during its restoration, in which there is the drying of heat, such as myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and similar to those which we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of the plaster that brings healing and pain relief.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe mugwort, and chickpeas, and the hairs of a man's teeth, or the feathers of a bird, and althaea, and equal parts of salt: they should be pounded, and sieved, and made into a plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	However, the quantity that should be made so that it remains a bandage, then dissolved, is such that you consider at that time, if no pain does not occur to the sick person, nor itching, nor move the broken member from its place: then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	However, if it happens to him in the place of strong itching, or painful disturbance, or inflation: then hurry, and dissolve it in the hour itself, and remove the plaster from him: and take a soft cloth, or a sea sponge, soft: and immerse it in warm water, and wash with it the place, until the itching is quieted, and the pain sits.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place on it a piece of clean linen soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it overnight, until you are sure that the hot abscess has been drained, and the inflation of the member has subsided, and the pain has been removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat this process gently and apply a small plaster: and do not bind it tightly with your first bandage, and the thin ones with it, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and inflation, and all the other symptoms have been completely removed, and you need a plaster and bandage, then repeat this as you did in the first place, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of these things happen to the member, then do not unbind it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when you unbind it after twenty days, all of that, according to what appears to you from the solution of the member, as we said, until whenever the fracture sticks and the coagulation of the flesh on it: then also add in the bandage more than your first bandage entirely: and also add in the feeding of the sick person, according to what preceded the memory of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see that the place of the fracture is already dry and thinned out more than necessary: then know that food is forbidden to reach it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore foment it with warm water at every place where you bind it, and let it be in all three days, and relieve the bandage a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, food reaches the member, and it is healed quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which the ignorant restorers do from the fracture of the member, when it is not restored in the first place, according to what is necessary, and is restored according to its twist, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were right, they would have said this in their books, and operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	I have not seen any trace of that among them at all, and it is indeed better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the formation of an accidental deformity on the head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fractures are diverse, and their shapes are many, and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For a fracture is that which is caused by impact with an axe: and the impact removes the entire bone until it reaches the periosteum, which is beneath the bone, just as it does in wood: and because of this, this species of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts something of the bone, and it cuts its face, and the cut does not penetrate to the end of it: and this species of fracture is called Kalán, that is, Luxation absolutely.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture that is crushing or grinding: and its cause is impact with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also penetrating, which approaches the periosteum, which is beneath the bone: or it is on the face of the bone: and this wound is of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone in its thinness of hair: and it is a small crack, and because of this, this species of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And there is a fracture that is caused by an accident, or by impact with a stone, and similar things, which cause the lamina of the bone to enter its interior, and it forms a concavity in the place: just as happens to copper pots when they are hit, and part of them enters their interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	This happens most frequently in the heads of wet bones, such as the heads of children's bones.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	All these species of fractures are separate, and I will come back to the memory of all that in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	We know all these types of fractures by examining them, and inquiring about them with probes, and removing the rotten flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species of the capillary is known by this, that it is scraped over the bone, and cleaned, and smeared on top with cauterizer, for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of fractures, first consider the symptoms of the infirm: then if you see from the symptoms that it clearly indicates fear, such as vomiting cholera, and extension, and loss of understanding, and loss of voice, and syncopis, and acute fever, and outflow of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar to these in many positions, certainly not healed: and if you see symptoms that do not frighten you, and you hope for salvation, then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if he comes to you wounded at first with the wound: and it is in the days of winter, then it is necessary that you strive for the removal of the bone on the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from the cloth rots, and those symptoms occur that we have mentioned.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	That if the fracture of the bone has already reached the cloth touching the brain, and is small, and attracted: then it is necessary that you cut the broken and worn part according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, that you should lance the wound of a head: and remove the cloth from over the mouth as much as possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light on the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you at the detection of bone bleeding blood, or hot abscess: then place it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, that you fill the place with infused cloths in vinegar and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the abscess sets, and you are secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the healing of the bone, and removal of it.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One way indeed is, that you cut the bone with an Incisor with a sharp edge: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Another way is, that you administer another Incisor after the first one slightly wider: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also administer another Incisor even wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second way is, that you have a number of different Incisors with you: some of which are wider to certain ones, and some of them shorter to certain ones: and they are in the last extreme of their sharpness, and they are from iron or steel: and use ease in percussion on the Incisor, so that it does not shake the head, and it does not hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary, that you make holes in its circumference before you administer Incisors, with drills which are called Terebra not penetrating deep: and they are not so called unless because they do not pass beyond the end of the fleshy part to that which is after it: because the tip of the Terebro is round on top of that which is under his sharp head, like a margin, and a small circle prevents submerging and passing through the density of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is suitable for you to take from these drill bits a large number, each of which corresponds to the thickness and density of the bone, until you have every possible skull drill: whose sharp end length and brevity in length should correspond to the thickness and density of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three types of drill bits or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	However, the quality of drilling around a broken bone is: that you place the drill on the bone, and rotate it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another location, and place what is between all the holes in the thickness of the radius, or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the chisel what is between all the holes from the bone: and make it as thin as possible on that from the fine end, as we said, until the roots of the bone, or by your hand, or with some other of those instruments which you have prepared for that: such as thin tenaille chisels and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to guard against all cautions, that the drill or chisel does not touch anything from those.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you are drilling around the bone and it has been separated from those, if it is continuous with that, and you have extracted it, it is necessary to cut, and equal the end of it which remains in the bone with another similar chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thinner and more delicate than other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains anything small from the bones and fragments: then take them with ease, with that which is at your disposal from among those instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with lint and ointments which we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	Here is another method of operation, entirely different from the previous one, which is quite distant from causing fear: this method was mentioned by Galen and highly praised by him, and this is his statement about it.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you to begin by carefully exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is more severe and more apparent: until you have exposed that part and placed the end of this lens-shaped incisor under it, whose shape is as follows.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	The lens-shaped part does not cut anything, and the sharp part of it advances on both sides of it in length, as you can see: so that the lens-shaped part is pressed against the bone, with its sharp part facing the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike on the incisor with a small mallet from one side until you have cut through the entire bone with ease, as it rolls: and you will be secure from any accident that you fear entirely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the healer were not more foolish than other people, and less knowledgeable about it, and not asleep, then if there remained any part of the bone attached to the cloth in certain places, he would cut it off from it with the end of this lens-shaped incisor, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the cloth, and what is cut off from the bone is its face, and there remain in it roughness and fine splinters: then you must scrape off that roughness, and remove those fine splinters with small rasps of various sizes, which you prepared earlier, so that it is possible for you to administer to them in every suitable place, and to make them straighter and more suitable according to the purpose of the operation, and the fractured bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that your assistants, in the ratio of your first cutting of the root's mouth, should shave them wider than those of the other razor-makers.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after him with a more subtle one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity until you reach the administering of their thinner and more subtle ones.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	And in each of the remaining cracks of the hair-like parts and the subtle fracture, it is necessary that your assistant should take care, according to that which leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And there is a thing that does not hide over every one, which in this art is whatever study, and it has stood on that which we wrote and showed in the great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the piece of cloth is detected and retained when you eradicate the mouth: then it is necessary that you should take the linen according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it on the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another linen doubled or tripled, and submerge it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first linen: and do that as easily as you can over it, so that it does not weigh heavily on him.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer above it the wide bandage: and do not tie it unless by the quantity which holds the wound only: and let it go with this care on one day or two days, until you are secure from hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer after it the medicines with which there is excessive dryness: such as the roots of lilies, and flour of herb, and powder of frankincense, and aristolochia, and similar to them: and it is that you should make from these medicines a powder which is powdered over the wound as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And it is universally applied in that, it administers every medicine of its property so as to cleanse, and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And it is applied according to your virtue, so that the wound in your healing be clear: nor is there in it the dirt of ointment, nor filthiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor do you dismiss the virus to gather in it at all: for when the virus gathers on the cloth of the brain, it corrupts it, and rots it, and there is a great evil after that on the weak one: and now it happens in the head, when the mouth is cleaned by it, especially when the care of it is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider then, if such things happen to the weak one which we said, know that it is certainly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not happen, unless from the medicine which is placed on it, and is in the virtue of that medicine, so as to make that blackness: then it is necessary for you to take from the honey one part, from the red oil three parts, and linen with them cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the head: afterwards care for it with the species of healing which come together, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	¶ On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that they are not broken from the nose except two of its upper parts at once, or one of them: because they are two bones: since below it is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and does not happen to it except wear, and twisting, and swelling.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary for you to insert your finger slightly in the nostril, and equal that fracture with your index finger, and thumb deformed, until the nose returns above its natural shape: and do this artfully, with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest that pain of yours occur through your operation on the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and your finger does not reach it, then it is necessary to equalize the end of the radius, where the swelling is small.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	But if indeed the fracture is in two parts, then do the same as that: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the heat of pus-filled abscesses.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce a linen strip into the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part: or introduce two strips if the fracture is in two parts: and let the swelling be of such quantity as to fill the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that linen strips should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	But that does not seem to me, rather it is necessary, that the linen strip be soaked in a white powder made with flour of moldova.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let go of the linen strip, until the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes tough.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is introduced into the place of the linen strip in the nose, after it has been covered with a soft cloth: and it is made so that it holds the broken nose more strongly, and so that the sick person is not hindered from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this matter is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do it: and if you wish, make the linen strips.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	But if it happens to the nose again while you are operating on the hot pus-filled abscess, apply nasal plasters with charcoal, or dissolved cotton in rose oil, or a little from dayquilon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If however, a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to apply a plaster made of the same with wheat flour, and a powder of turpentine, mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft bandage over it, and do not bind the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If indeed the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then it is necessary to split them and remove them with the tools that are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then cut the wound, and care for it with what covers and heals it, and strengthens it with suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If however a wound occurs between the nose, then it is necessary to care for it with leeches: and administer a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: if it is deformed only, and not broken into two, and care is taken to its insides: then its knowledge is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is in the right part, then insert the index finger of the left hand into the weak bone: similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push with it the swelling of the fracture inside with ease to the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone properly, and with it make it even.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If however the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension from both parts, according to straightness: until it is possible to make an evening of it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, the commotion or disruption has already occurred in the teeth, then bind them with thread made of gold, silver, or silk, hoping that they will remain intact.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a broken ceramic over the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a double layer of cloth over it, and place a large, well-made stomach button on the cloth: or an equal piece of leather from the sole of a shoe, in the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above, according to how the bandage of that type is prepared for you and its application fits, until it is not destroyed: and instruct the weak person to use it with tranquility and quietness: and place his drinks with gentle sips.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you estimate that something is already changing the shape in some ways: then hasten and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been changed from it, and make plasters of it from the flour of the millstone, with egg white, or with sisami flour, after you have removed the broken ceramic: and place a soft cloth on the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While therefore it remains attached to that plaster over it, and the disposition of the bone is not changed, leave it, so that it does not dissolve, until it is healed: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For often this fracture is bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	But if meanwhile an inflammation hot occurs, then administer to it what we said is often used in the sedation of it, until that inflammation is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For now a piece of bone is already separated from the bone, or from the splinter: then carefully take it out with you that suits you in the removal of those from the tools.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the wound opening is constricted, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the amount of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed that bandage, and there remains none of it, then sue the wound opening, if it is wide: and if not, place upon it some of those plasters which are suitable for that, and cover it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	¶ On the restoration of the clavicle, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The clavicle is most often broken from the anterior part on the side of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For indeed it is broken and separated into two, except that some bandages occur in it: and it is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or thus, that some bandages occur in the bone of the bandage: and it is more difficult for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or thus, that it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And operation in it when the fracture is without wound, is, that you make present to be two assistants, that one of them holds the following instrument which follows the clavicle broken, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equal the fracture with your fingers, until it becomes its form, according to what is necessary: and there is not in it protrusion, nor hollowness.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then it is necessary, that you place under the infirm sphere of the tip a ball of cloth, or of wool: and its size should be according to the amount of your need: and extend, and elevate the clavicle, and cut the ball with your hand, until equal the fracture, according to what is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the tip of the fork to the outside, because it has reached the depth, then the weak one must be bent over his shoulder and you place a pillow under his arm in the size of a medium, and press his helper's arm downwards until the tip of the fork that is at the depth is lifted upwards. Then straighten the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	But if you feel a broken piece of the fork and it moves, then you must drill into it and extract the broken piece of the fork with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	But if it is stuck in the bone, then use your skills in the incision and one of the prepared incisors to hold the instrument that will support the saw under the fork, which is a tool made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spiral that does not have a concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	Its width should be according to what you need from the size of the bone and its shape.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length of it, however, should also be according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	It should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	But if the wound that you cut when you extracted the broken piece of bone is wide and you want to prevent infection, then gather two lips of the wound with stitches.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	But if the wound is small and you fear infection, then fill the wound with cloth and cotton according to the size of the cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	But if an infection occurs, then pour oil with roses, vinegar, and wine over it and place it on the wound.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	When the fracture of a bone is without wound and without incision, it is treated by applying a plaster made from flour milled from grain mixed with egg yolk onto the bone.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft bandage on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its splint, if you have one.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a hollow reed, that is, the one held by the Saracens, which is very long: and its width should be the size of one palm or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a double-layered pad and plaster on top of it.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a thin board, the width of which is three fingers and the length similarly.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the board in the place where the hollow reed falls on the fracture and the affected area.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the hollow reed on the fracture as it was wrapped, and wrap it around his neck, and under the splint of the healthy person and under the splint of the sick person: and reduce it over all parts, and however you see that the bandage holds the fracture, that is the correct bandage: and this should not be hidden from you, and the whole, so that the board does not move above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, it is necessary to look at the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever the ligament becomes soft and you see the board already moving away: then correct it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person's pillow on his back, and place a small pad under his splint at night, so that when he is lifted up with his aid, it is on his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, the fracture of the clavicle is raised by elevating the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Tie his arm to his neck: and do not untie the bandage, unless it is necessary due to an emergency, such as skin irritation or an abscess, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then reapply the plaster, if you see his face towards that direction.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the constriction, and let him go, until he is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the broken clavicle is bound and strengthened as much as possible in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some people in less than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	¶ On the restoration of the broken clavicle.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The clavicle is rarely broken, and in the side of it: and they are not broken from it except its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it is broken from that place, and it is broken in the middle of it, and it is not known except by touch: then according to what is the shape of the fracture, try its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to the natural shape in every way possible, which is possible to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place it on the place of powder from the mill with white chalk, and lint, and place above a pad made of doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on it a wide flat plate from thin board according to the size of the clavicle, or a little larger than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed there is a hollowness in some place of the clavicle, then fill that hollowness with soft lint, until the plate descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind above with long adhesive tape, with a proper constriction, and the strength of the plate, until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the ligament is softened, tie it up and place an equal weight if it moves from its place: and let the sick person lie on his sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then untie the ligament: and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from the bones of which the union is not to be feared, nor their dissolution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if a fragment of bone proceeds under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we said in the fracture of the rudder from the suppression of abscesses by heat, if something happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Of the restoration of a broken chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of it, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities are broken very much, and they are crushed from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is broken, which declines to the lower parts, and pain happens to it, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps vomiting of blood, and the hollowness in the bone fractured is not hidden from sensation, its restoration is, that he should lie propped up on his back: and place between his spatulas a pillow.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and gather his ribs from both sides with his hands: and make it smooth in its equilibrium, according to every mode as possible is and fits, until it returns to the shape of the bone, according to what it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster on top of it and a bandage, and place an astellum above it from a thin board made of willow or chalingi, and similar ones in lightness, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then thinly spread the bandage when binding it over the broken jaw, so that it does not move: and go with the bandage according to its roundness towards the back several times, and tighten it with a suitable constriction.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it: and if necessity provokes its dissolution at a prurient place, or corrosion that happens in the area, or pain, or abscess: then hurry, and dissolve it, and remove the plaster, and correct what happens with the mode of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see that it faces that form: and connect it to a constriction, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	¶ On the restoration of the ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that the fracture of the ribs does not happen, except in places that follow the back and from the ends of them from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not break, except for this reason, because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense with inspection with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is made in such a way, that the fracture with the fingers according to the possible mode, until it equals the figure, as it should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then plasters, and bind the broken jaw with an astellum, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is declined towards the interior: then it happens that a painful and puncturing pain occurs, like that puncturing which happens to him who has pleurisy: because the bone presses the membrane, and also difficulty of breathing, and cough, and vomiting of blood many: and this is difficult of cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And already the ancients were skilled in this with many ingenious methods: and from them are those who say, that you should place foods for the sick which will generate inflammation and softness, so that the belly becomes inflamed, and stretches, and drives the fracture to the exterior.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed abhor, that there not be a quick cause for making an abscess hot, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then you add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: place it on a soft spot, then suck it with strength, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, one should be afraid that the soft spot will draw excess fluids to the place, due to the weakness of the body.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the spot be covered with wool which has already been immersed in warm oil: and they place feathers between the ribs, until it is filled: so that it will be a bandage equal when you roll it according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person is healed by purgatives from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the persistent thing binds the sick person, whom he does not tolerate, and the mouth pierces the bandage by a wounding puncture, and we fear for the sick: then it is necessary, that we cut over the spot, and remove from the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we will place on it an instrument which will save the sick person, of which the memory preceded: and we will cut the mouth with ease, and we will cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will gather two wound lips, if it is large with a suture: and we will heal it with plasters, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If however an abscess hot happens in the meantime, then hurry, and pour feathers in rose oil, and place on the spot: and the sick person is healed with it which is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, let it be bandaged on the side where it lies when sleeping, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of a fracture of the spine in the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and rarely wear and tear; similarly, in the spine.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore it happens to someone, and you want to know whether it will heal, or not; then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stupefied, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then you know that it is not healing, and in many positions it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them, and feels contraction in them with your fingers and pricking: then you know that the neck of the bone is saved, and that the weak one will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if he also damages the spine in the back similar to that, and you want to know whether it will heal, or not; then consider at his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and that it happens in them as in the hands: then when he lies on his back, wind and evacuation without volition; and when he lies on his belly, evacuation without volition; and when he lies on his back, and wants to urinate, and cannot: then you know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not give efforts in its treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if nothing happens to him from that, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure for what happens from that is, you should try to sedate hot abscesses: thus, you should place on the Spondylus (spine) worn-out rose oil alone: or with a cloth moistened with warm oil.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place on it several times a day until the abscess becomes sedated: then place one of the strengthening, drying, and binding plasters on the spot, and bind it with a bandage: and instruct the sick person to use it with rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And he should not sleep on the side where he found the pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens on the worn-out Spondylus (spine) or something that is already separated from it: then you should leave it alone and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather the two wound lips, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some fleshly (flesh-like) substance, from the ointments, until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the last of the broken bones of the tail, and it is the end: then you should insert your left hand's finger into the anus, and equalize the fractured bone with your other hand, as much as possible, and with the second equality.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place on it, and remove it: and care for the wound with the cure that preceded, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	¶ On the restoration of the Ankle.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the ankle rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they break, then the fracture of them is not, unless the comminution in the extremities of them: and they are broken in length, and decline to the insides: and the sick person feels pain in the spot, and puncture: and the leg that breaks is astonished.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And indeed its restoration is, that you extend your hand upon it, until you stand over the fracture as its figure is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	But if the fracture is only in its extremities, then make it equal to the fracture, according to what is prepared for you from equality, until it resembles its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is in its length, or already inclines to the interior: then make the injured one lie on his belly, until preparation for the restoration of that fracture is made for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	Then when you have made it equal, place a plaster upon it: then place an splint of wood, or of skin, upon it: and bind it with a bandage over which you do not fear the exchange of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And make its hollowness equal to that which fills it, until the bandage takes it according to equality: and command the injured one, that he sleep on his back, or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if an hot abscess happens to him: then cease from its extension, and of his restoration, until the hot abscess sits: and place upon it what sits upon it, according to what preceded, then return to its restoration: and bind it as it should be.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if indeed it happens in the bone of a fracture, or is crushed, extract.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	¶ Of the restoration of the fracture of the Supporting-bone.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The support is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Spoon.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	But if it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligaments are tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is hung from a raised place: and the weak one sits on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his broken arm on a piece of wood, until he reaches the label of it, in which the middle is attached to the flexible wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then he hangs something heavy above him, so that he stretches himself downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor balances the fracture with his hands at the same time, until the fracture returns, according to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another way is that the weak one bends over his shoulder: and hangs his hand from his neck with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants, that one of them holds that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other holds below him, and each of them stretches himself to his part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you want, that the extension be stronger, then tie under the fracture with a ligament, and above it with another ligament: and each of the two assistants stretches himself to both parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	Therefore if the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it must be placed that one ligament under the label, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it must be placed that ligament on that place, and on the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then balance the fracture with ease without labor, until when the fracture is balanced according to what is necessary, and applied with good application: then tie it, if not an abscess of hot water happens.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But indeed if an abscess of hot water happens, then let go the tie until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on it a piece of lint soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the abscess rests: then bind it: and the way to bind it is, as you would place a plaster on a fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new cloth bandage over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then attach the arm to the support itself, and place her hand open on her shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind over the support of the arm, so that the arm stays in the position of the stars: if he does not forbid you from him anything, neither anything is changed on you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if you fear, that something is changed on you from the broken bone, then use stars: and it is, as you place over the fracture itself the star which is wider and stronger than the other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every star width of a finger: and the length of the stars according to the fracture with addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the stars with the binding I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your binding be over the place of the fracture tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as much as the fracture lengthens, the binding should be looser.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of the stars and the binding, as we said, at the hour when you restore the member immediately, then do: and if you fear the abscess hot, then release the binding and the stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the bandage in all three days, so that it does not happen in the place of itching, or inflation, or food is prevented from coming to the member, because of the disposition of the excess of the binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Then correct all that, according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are confident that nothing will go wrong from it, then do not untie the ligature until after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep on his back, and his hand on his stomach: and place under his support a cushion filled with equal wool.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day, so that the broken limb's figure is not dissolved, nor the ligature softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct all of it with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place the food of the sick according to the order that we prescribed, so that the food is delicate in the first place, until he begins to swallow: then it is necessary to thicken his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the custom of the support and leg is that it is swallowed in forty days: therefore then it is necessary to untie, and give a bath, and treat with ointments which correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul and worn: then do not untie from it the ligature and stars until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	¶ On the restoration of the fractured Arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is small: and that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps it breaks only the larger humerus, or the smaller: and perhaps both at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller upper humerus is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower humerus is broken, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones are broken at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	Therefore, if the broken bone is slightly displaced upwards, it is appropriate for the physician to apply gentle traction until it is restored to its original position.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	However, if the displacement is significant, then a stronger traction should be applied.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to place the hand's shape at the restoration and extend the traction above the bed.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the other fingers: and the joint below should be lower than all the other fingers, or the rest: and the weak person should sit squarely on himself, and the bed should be in front of him, or directly in front of him, at a height, so that the weak person does not encounter unnecessary labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the servant should extend the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another servant should extend it from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should restore the bone until he can restore it to its best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are splinters in the broken bone, then try to reduce all the fragments to their original place by your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	However, if it appears to be a separate splinter that is sticking out and piercing the skin, and there is no hope of its restoration, then cover it and remove it according to the method that was mentioned in the things that were previously mentioned.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	However, if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already dealt with that section separately, so take the treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	However, if an abscess with heat occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then make a linen cloth with a thick layer of rose-colored oil, and a white clay, and it should be in the middle between thickness and thinness: and tie the cloth over it with a fine traction until the abscess is soothed: then remove the clay, and place a prepared plaster made from mill flour with egg white on it.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place a splint, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in many arrangements: whether it is a fracture in one fossa, or in two fossae at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage on the stronger and more vehement spot over the fracture, and a little more with the bandage to the superior or inferior part of the fracture: or place a softer bandage on it for a while, according to what was previously mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the bandages that cover the fracture be soft, moist cloths: and they should not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread that is used to tie it be a linen thread, medium between thin and thick, as we have mentioned.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something occurs that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to soothe the limb with warm water until the itching subsides, and do not bind the limb until it is calm, then repeat the bandaging.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage is already softened, and the bone is already removed, and similar things: then correct all of this by your virtue, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb because of the excess of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and leave it for a few days until the nourishment reaches it, then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if nothing of the above happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to dissolve it, unless after twenty days, or about these.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then hang the hand of the sick person around his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be level, and guard it by its strength from being jolted.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days, and perhaps it will be healed in eighty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this is according to the dispositions of the humors and the dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the healing of fractures in the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures of the hand and fingers rarely occur in the palm.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him, unless by frequent rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore the fracture or rubbing occurs in the foot, then it is necessary for the sick person to sit squarely, and there should be a seat of equal height before him.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on that extended one.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the servant should extend the broken bones, and the physician should equal them until they are joined together in good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to place a plaster and bandage on it, unless there is no hot abscess.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint above according to the size of the wound, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is to the lower part of the foot, then make a similar sphere from the cloth, and command the sick person to cover it with his broken foot, and then bind it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And the splint should be made of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather can be applied to the body of the foot: and bind it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is to the outside, then it is necessary: to place a splint above, and another splint from below in the plantar area, and the hand should be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a bandage, as the hand is bent, and extend it between the fingers with a ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture occurs to one of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it will be treated accordingly.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it will be bandaged with the plantar area: and if it is a small finger, place a straight splint on it, a parva, to elevate the fracture and not move it.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is to the other fingers, such as the middle, and index, and auricular, and anular, then it will be treated and bound with the healthy finger that follows it, or all will be bound according to continuity, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small splint on top of it, as we said in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the arrangement of abscesses with hot compresses: and place it with what is necessary, when something happens from it, according to its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	¶ On the restoration of a fracture of the hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone often breaks, and is felt, because it turns to the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in such a way that the ligament is bound above the fracture, and the other ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person is stretched out on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then extend all the assistant's ligament to its part according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If, however, the fracture is near the root of the thigh bone, then the ligament should be tied to the part of the thighbone above the fracture, so that the extension force goes upwards: and another ligament should be tied under the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then the ligament near the knee should be tied so that the extension force goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon should adjust both hands to set the bone back into its natural shape, until it is reduced to its natural form: and he should join the bone with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then one should apply a plaster and bandage, unless an abscess has occurred in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If however an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for several days, until the abscess becomes hot, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage should be applied thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	One should cover over the fracture above with a soft cloth, that is, a bandage: and double it twice, or three times: and there should remain some excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then cover the leg, until it reaches the calcaneus at the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper parts of both parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up the excess from the bandage on the thigh and leg.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the thigh in the place of the fracture some small pieces, and place one piece above the knee bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle above the place of the fracture, with three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you lengthen with a ligature from the place of the fracture, the narrower and softer and gentler your constriction should be.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then draw the thread to both ends, which you inserted between the thigh and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore tie with both ends three small knots that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with both ends of the thread downwards, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tie also both ends of the knots from the other side: so that the thread is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the constriction above that, while it remains, so that no corrosion or abscess or swelling or similar things occur to the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore immediately with the removal of it, and correct that which happened from it all, according to what we said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if indeed a piece of bone is in the bone that pricks: then it is necessary for you to make them equal, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find over that, and remove it: and care with him whose place it preceded, until he is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, besides what knots are added to it, as we said in the aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	But indeed in the restoration of a fracture such as this, no lameness occurs to the weak.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides what is applied to him the other leg, then it is necessary that he who owns it always limps.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound in fifty days, or a little is added to it, or a little is subtracted from it: all of this is according to the diversity of the constitutions, and the other arrangements.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Translation: On the Restoration of a Fractured Knee Cap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that a fracture of the knee cap is rare, but it often occurs due to wear and tear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a fracture does occur, then it will be either a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And there is the wound with and without injury.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it is treated as a whole with sensibility.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that it should be made equal to what was broken off from its parts with fingers, until it is gathered together and joined according to what is possible from equality and ease, and craftsmanship.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster made from semolina or malt flour with egg white on it: and place a round bandage on top of it if you have one: and bind it above with a suitable bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the positions that we have mentioned for other fractures: as hot abscess and similar to it: so, place everything that is suitable with it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Translation: On the Restoration of a Fractured Leg Bone.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that the leg bone is made up of two bones, one of which is thick and called the leg bone, and the other is thin and called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens that both of these species of fracture can occur in both bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is made like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are broken at once, the leg is turned in all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thin bone is broken, the leg is turned towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the bone is broken coarsely, you will find it below: and among them are those that do not conceal themselves from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then apply the extension, equality, and tying of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a filthy fracture, having many splinters, then the extension should be less and gentler in your relief.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the thigh there is something from the operation on the arm: and it is, that when you make the stars equal and complete all your operation, then take two bands of pine wood, which are administered in the manufacture of sun dials, which are placed under the tiles: and they are made from the fronds of the palm tree: and choose from them those which have a small thickness, and are not from the small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the thigh from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then roll up on each cloth two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg from one side, and the other from the other side: and they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie two bands in three places from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when stricture is prohibited, the leg leans to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed the cradle is applied according to the length of the thigh, and is placed in it the leg, so that it keeps it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	Indeed, it is very important to do this in a fracture when there is a wound properly with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and work with it with the utmost effort to avoid suppuration, or swelling, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If something happens from these (remedies), then apply to him with that which is appropriate, until he is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the Fracture of Bones in the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Fracture does not occur completely in the heel.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	Fracture does occur sometimes in the bones of the foot and toes, and it does not occur to them unless there is wear in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see those bones raised above each other, then place the weak person's foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand up and place your foot on that which is raised from those bones: then press or step on it, and make it even, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster and bandage on top: and place under the sole of the foot a small board, which has two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tie it with the foot with a proper binding, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things that it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore it passes him three days or four, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones evened, whether they are fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation in them is therefore as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If however some fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them even according to what I have told you in the restoration of fingers hands.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger a splint according to the length of the finger, and it should be slightly wider: then place under the foot this board that I have told you, and tie it with a proper binding.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed what is broken off from the bones is two or three or more, then place on each finger of your hand the amount corresponding to its quantity, wrapped in a linen cloth: and bind the table on the lower part of the foot: and let him stand on one end of the table outside the arch of the foot, so that he may hold it well with retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it may happen that you will not forget, but rather consider all that I have told you about the other fractures from the accidents that we mentioned: and place against each accident with it what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of the vulva of a woman, and the bone of the clitoris, and the virgin's bone.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then let her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her slightly towards the back of her own body, and let her be held from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife will fill her vulva with cotton, until she fills it: and let it be made into a sphere in the vulva from that.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman will be shaken, and her back will be raised gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that is the way it comes out, until it becomes before the vulva as a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a pillow on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	Therefore when she wants to urinate, she will remove the cotton with ease, then she will urinate: and she will return it according to the manner in which you introduced it first: then she will return to her pillow first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do this for seven days, or about, for that bone is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a catheter, and place it over the opening of the bone with a reed tube, and introduce the whole catheter into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the cannula with force until the bladder is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture returns otherwise.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it should be filled with cotton and left for several days, as we have mentioned, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the tooth of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and its equilibrium that which we have mentioned in the bone of the anchor.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum should not be hidden in these close fractures, which occur less frequently, especially if there is some study or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many positions the right way of restoration and tightening of itself, so understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But in the penis of a man when it is broken, take the neck of a goose: and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place a wrap made of cloth on top of it and wrap it up, and let it be dismissed for three days or about that, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	About the restoration of a broken bone when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It happens to him who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the thigh bone, or a helper, or similar to it, so that you may hurry and perform a bloodletting immediately: if the conditions for bloodletting are attested to you, as we have mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	But if the wound is bleeding, then you should hurry to cut it open, so that powder made from zegea is sprinkled on top of it: if there is no other present for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in that same day: and do not postpone it, unless an abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed a hot abscess occurs, then delay its treatment until the ninth day, until the abscess settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days, for you would be causing it to suffer bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if a broken tooth is sticking out above the skin and has been removed: then you must try to reduce it and equalize it with your hands with slight force and extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if the extension of it is not prepared and its equalization with your hands is not possible: then reduce it with this tool.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is a tool that is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And therefore it is necessary for the doctor to take from them three, or four according to the quantity that is needed for that from each kind of cure in every species of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a small bulge on it, so that it is not doubled up under compression on it in the hour of operation: and let it be sharp-pointed, with a margin at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above its bulge from the middle up to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it is necessary to place the sharp end of the tool on the edge of the protruding bone: and push it with that force, until when the tooth returns and is equalized by some equality.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Then try to equalize the ends of the fracture one after another.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	But if its ends are thinly fractured, and the tool does not receive it with good reception, then you must try to cut the end of that bone until the tool has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed you cannot reduce them with what we have mentioned, then you should use the incisors or a saw that is most suitable for you in any possible way.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then smooth that which remains in the bone due to its roughness and small roughnesses.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced and it finds an infirm person after the reduction with a severe pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you give a strong support to the infirm when the completion of your restoration is made for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in a styptic wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And you will not place on the wound a poultice, nor anything in which there is oil: so that it does not cause decay and corruption in itself.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer small portions at the time of the completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let the wound heal: thus, you should cut with forceps a hole in the folds according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware of all precautions, so that you do not tie the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times have the foolish doctors done this: and they have caused to happen to their infirm patients either death, or corruption, or zucchum, that is, a gangrene.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And your bandage should be soft, gentle, different from the bandages of the remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	But if the wound is evil, or is a large wound, and you fear some bad accidents that we have mentioned, and you find pain in the suspended place: then it is not necessary to place on it poultices.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them bandages from hard cloth in the place of the stars, and tie it up with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus in it: then remove the cloth that you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply lint, and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as TetraPharmacon ointment, and similar to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it may happen that you need to untie the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening, until it heals and becomes healthy.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the limb in such a way that the pus runs off from it easily to the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	But if many days pass and the wound does not heal, nor does the pus separate from it: then you know that there are small fragments of bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, it is necessary to examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	But how many of those small fragments are separated, remove them, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of which are not separated, and which pierce the limb and cause pain, try to cut them and remove them in any way that is possible for you to do so.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	But if it happens that the wound becomes putrid, or has a bad smell, or another sign of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to apply to each of them with what is appropriate for their cure, as mentioned in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in the limb in which it is necessary for my speech to stand, and with which you direct your present mind when a bone breaks and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip bone, and the shoulder blade, and similar bones from large limbs: do not assume that it can be pulled back, for often death results from it, indeed let it go, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, if it seems to you that the wound needs care, you should care for it; otherwise, let it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of nodulation at the site of a broken bone.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This nodulation often occurs at the site of a broken bone.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially that which is near the joints, and it disfigures the shape of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the member from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, consider if the nodulation is recent: administer medicines in it that have astringency, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarseol, and acacia, and similar to them.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, you will take some or all of these: and mix them with astringent wine, or with albumen, or with vinegar: and place them on the nodulation in wool, and tie them over it with a good binding.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And let go of the binding, but do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and repeat another one until the nodulation is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tie over it a leaden strip properly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is the property of removing everything that is feared from the members.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the nodulation has already become hard and is tightly bound, and urgently demands to be removed, then cut it from the top part of it, and cut off the projecting excess: or shave it with certain razors until it is removed: and care for it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On the treatment when a member is restored, but remains underneath its natural form.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored and the member remains after it, thin and weak: then it is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is, the excessive solution and bandaging of the ligaments and its bandage: either because of the excess of the tightness of the ligaments, until it prevents the nourishment from running to the member: or because of the excess of the embrocation at an inappropriate time: or because of the lack of blood in the body of the weak and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its treatment is, to feed the weak: and to make its body tender, until the blood multiplies in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place salt on the member: so that the salt attracts much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And frequently bandage it with warm water, until the nourishment runs, and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	§ On the treatment of bones that have been broken and restored twistedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens to the member already restored after its healing, that twisting and projection of the bone broken, or knotting: and it is deformed by it, but the member is not prevented from its natural operation: then it is not necessary to receive the word of him who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have already been many foolish doctors and restorers who did this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed very shameful, leading to death, or great fear, so that it may be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limping and knotting are recent: then it is necessary to bandage with warm water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as high grass, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let him make for her an adhesive plaster with a softening ointment, as dyachylon is properly made.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let him take the mucilage of the root of althea, and mix it with the fat of a hen, or with sesame oil: and let him apply it with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let ripe figs be taken, and crushed with the dust of a turtle dove, and with similar things which are called reducing agents for strengthening consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the contraction is solved with frequent and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let motion be given to the limb to all parts at every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the twisting has already preceded, and it has become strong, and turned into a stone, and necessity has been provoked to its cure with iron: then it is necessary that it be secured above it, and the continuity of the bone be dissolved, and that which superfluously protrudes from the twisting or the bone be cut away with fine incisors: and let facility be given in that with solicitude and study.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	¶ Of speech in dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the escape of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prohibited from its motion, and the figure of the limb is deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes to happen upon the weak pain, and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore when it happens to someone, then one must hasten to its restoration: nor does it delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes suppurated, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not necessary that it be moved, nor stretched in the hour of its suppuration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes spasms and painful wounds.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then you must hasten to perform bloodletting on the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then he should be dismissed until the abscess has healed.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be rubbed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be returned with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every limb should be treated with that which its memory brings to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	Indeed, I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even according to what preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Chapter on the care of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two lower jaws rarely dislocate.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For indeed they are removed from their places by a slight movement, and they become somewhat softened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely, entirely, until they become softened to the chest part, until the saliva of the sick person flows, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is rolled out with his speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	But when the dislocation of it is slight, then it returns to many positions by itself with little.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete, entire: then it must be administered reduction of it quickly, and not delay entirely: and it is, that the attendant holds the head of the sick person: and the physician inserts his finger of one hand in the root of the jaw dislocation between his teeth, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	If the dislocation is from both parts, he should insert two of his fingers simultaneously.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hand should be outside, which he balances.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to clean his jaws, and make them ready for eating in every part.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor balances the jaw, and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction of it is difficult, especially if both jaws are together: then administer steam with hot water and oil until it becomes easy to reduce both: nor delay the reduction of both at all, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are balanced, and the mouth of the sick person is closed, and they are not softened: then place on them cloths of cloth, with wax that is made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it will be bound with ease with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the patient's sleep will be on his back: and his head will be between two cloths, so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor will he try or be forced to chew anything: rather let him be given soft food, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is bound: then he eats what he wants, and is given it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He will not labor over the operation of his mouth at eating and drinking, and talking, until the jaw is bound, and he is healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of both jaws is difficult, when they are dislocated at any time, and they do not return to their places: then often fevers and constant diarrhea occur from this: and perhaps the belly of the sick person is relieved, and perhaps he vomitus pure choler.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see that, then you will know that it is a fatal condition and often leads to the death of the person who experiences it within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the Scapula and the extremities of the arms.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The scapula is not dislocated from the side within, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated to the outside, and this is indicated by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the weak person should lie on his back and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then bind the place with your palm using strong binding, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster on it and bandages, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	However, the extremities that follow the elbow are continuous with it and do not usually dislocate, except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	However, if it is dislocated on some day: then it must be reduced and adjusted according to what we have said, and that which is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster on it and bandages, and bind it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the weak person to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when the extremity of the arm is also separated from its place, it is reduced with the same cure.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the Arm.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You should know that the arm is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it is dislocated towards the part of the armpit to the lower parts.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it is dislocated towards the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the arm: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated towards the back, due to the spoon.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated towards the front, due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is very much dislocated and exits towards the lower part, especially in those where the flesh is little.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it exits in them quickly, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those where the flesh is much, it is the opposite of that, namely that it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that the blow or accident, and the arm becomes suppurated with heat, and it is thought because it is already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, one must try that, until you stand on the certainty of it, and then proceed to its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is known when it is towards the lower part, and you distinguish between the arm dislocated and the healthy arm.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find among them a clear difference, and you find in the arm pit, concavity, and under the arm at the touch of the head of the arm as if it were an egg: and the weak one cannot reduce his hand to his ear, nor move it in all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you find a clear touch, and it does not hide.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And this dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent, or the boy is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, as he raises his hand to the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then you place your thumbs under its arm pit, and raise the joint with force up to its place: and the helper raises his hand, and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place it lower down, for it quickly returns.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return as we said, and there are many days since the dislocation occurred: then the sick person should be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation given that softens and soothes, as if roots of alteae, and foenugraecum, and melilot were boiled in water, and it is administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick person should be bandaged on their back: and place under their neck a sphere and wool, which is equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should place his heel on the sphere, and lift the shoulder with strength, and pull the hand of the sick person towards the lower parts.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another servant should hold the head of the sick person, so that it does not move towards the lower parts: for he indeed returns quickly.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is, that you make a man present who is longer than the sick person, and stands on the side, and puts his arm under the neck of the sick person: and lifts his neck towards the upper parts, until the sick person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another servant should pull the hand of the sick person towards the lower parts of his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick person is light: then it is necessary, that he be suspended with something else, that weighs him down: for the dislocation returns quickly.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And he is also reduced according to another method: and it is, that a long piece of wood be shaped on the ground, whose head is round in shape: like the handle of a mortar: which is not thick, nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then the sick person should be placed under him after they place cloths on the head of the wood: and the sick person should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then, his hand is extended to the lower part on the other side, and his body is extended from the other part with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If it is difficult to reduce all that we have said, then use this care: and it is, that you take a stick whose length is the quantity of two biceps, and its width is the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness is the quantity of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its insertion into the titillus is eased in depth, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then, clean cloths are tied over the round head, so that the weak stick does not hurt.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then, the weak one is placed under the titillus, so that the hand or arm is extended over the stick until the lower parts: and the stick is tied to the aid and arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then, the arm is placed on the width of the steps of the ladder, and the hand is extended to the lower parts, and the remaining body is suspended from the other part.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore the entrance of its joint is completed according to whatever possible mode is: then it is necessary that you place under the titillus a ball of equal quantity from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then, place the prepared plaster from the flour of the mill with bdellium, and egg white on the whole arm, as it rolls above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then, tie under the titillus a decent bandage: and the ligament is rolled above the plaster: and the hand of his is connected to the neck of itself, and it is suspended, and it is not moved the hand of its seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that you place food for the weak one, until the limb is strengthened: because it is faster for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then place a larger one after seven days, or five, and exercise it with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	Therefore, if it hardens but does not soften, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the joint is frequently dislocated due to moisture that affects it, or for another reason: then it must be treated with a cautery with three holes, as prescribed in the previous chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If this is done and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the joint does not strengthen, and the plaster and bandage are applied again several times and it does not strengthen and falls, and cannot be raised to the upper parts: then you know that the nerves of his arm, which are attached to the shoulder, have been cut, or extended, or softened: and you know that the joint will never heal in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	However, for dislocations that occur towards the chest and nipple, or to the back, reduction is done with impulse and extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining bandage and care are applied, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If a severe and slowness in its movement occur after healing, then the weak person should use the bath frequently until that severity is relieved, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Chapter on the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and it also returns with difficulty: and indeed it dislocates to all parts, and especially to the front, or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it falls under sight, and under touch, in whatever shape it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	When you join a dislocated elbow with a healthy one, it is clearly indicated to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint becomes stiff, and it cannot double the arm, nor touch with it its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must act quickly and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess occurs to it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it will not be healed at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse in all kinds of dislocations, and more severe pain to them: and often death accompanies with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is from those that can be reduced, is that the hand of it is stretched with two hands: and the arm of it is expanded, and the hand of the physician is above the elbow and under it, and he pushes the joint with his fingers at the same time, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns so that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	But if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer strong and very powerful extension: and it is that two assistants stretch the arm: and two assistants hold him also, so that he is not removed during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is rolled back to all parts after it has been stripped over his hand a long doubled cloth, or broad ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he anoints it with oil: that it may be from those that help in the slipperiness of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he pushes the joint with a strong push, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	After reducing it, a plaster should be applied to it, which has the properties of stopping bleeding and drying with skin, and is bound tightly with an appropriate binding.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the neck of the weak person: and let it be left for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be dissolved.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is strengthened in its place, then the ligament should be dissolved from it, and let it be left.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not well bound, then repeat the plaster and ligament, and let it be left for several days until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then dissolve it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if a gravity occurs to it after the reduction of the joint, and the position is in motion: then administer moisture in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is bound, or put on the joint of the thigh, that is, the fat of the male goat.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it should be bound, and let it be left on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it off, and put it in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore it sweats, then friction of the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat on it goat's fat once, and second, and third with entry into the bath until it is soothed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, put on it manure of calf, moist, heated with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For indeed it is soothed, and returns to its position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	About the cure of Albucasis' dislocation.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Albucasis' hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	The reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Conversely, the remaining joints are different.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed of reducing its dislocation should be in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the wound becomes putrid: or an abscess with heat occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of its dislocation is, that one places the weak hand of the Mahassem on the table, and extends the minister's hand: and the doctor places his hand on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm of the hand has already withdrawn to the side of the hand: then the weak back of his own hand should be placed on the table at extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inside on the table, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls on that prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with plaster laid on the abscess: and leave it alone, do not repeat that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not bear, and you cannot do the reduction of it after it has passed days over it, indeed the joint remains according to its tortuosity: and nothing harms the weak except that the hand is softened, and it cannot bind anything: then know that the nerves are cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore there is no skill in it, except that it should be bound with a hot iron near the place of its dislocation.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not restore anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not return, then place on it plaster which we have told you.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is tied and left for five days: afterwards it is dissolved and released, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If, however, it becomes stiff and something heavy occurs to it, then it is soothed with warm water and friction several times until it is eased.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	§ On the Cure of Dislocations of the Fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When any of the fingers is dislocated from every part, or any finger is dislocated from the back of the palm or its belly: then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and suspend it against the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang it up and extend it until it is straight on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore it is night, tie it according to the same account: and do not cease to untie it on that day: and exercise it with motion: and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days until it is tied.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with it if it is dislocated to the palm of the hand: and tie it to that part, and do your first operation on it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	§ On the Cure of Dislocations of the Sacrum.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the sacrum of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many spines are moved from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the sick person quickly.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the discharge of the sick person goes out without will, and he cannot hold it: and often some of his limbs are softened from it, or both his legs, or both his arms, or one of them: or one spine is moved from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many times it is removed, which is often removed from four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed to the back, is called Humps.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure of it is indeed, that you consider at that time, if Humps occur from childhood: then there is no cure for it, and there is no healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which occurs by chance, or by blow, or by similar things, the ancients have already spoken of various methods of cure in long speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which very little returns with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	Indeed, I have already abbreviated from it, of which very little excuses from much of its proximity to my intention: and my explanation which I explained it, and formed an instrument of it in a different way from that by which they showed it, and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in Humps which occur from the front part, there is no skill, and there is no healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which is made to two sides even.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, except that which occurs in the back properly, with that which I relate: and it is, that the weak one be stretched on his face on an equal footstool near the wall: and the wet bandage is spread under it, so that it does not hurt his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then place a straight wooden pole fixed in the fork in the ground, at the end of the footstool, about his head: and another wooden pole about his feet in the other end of the footstool: and the servant holds the wood, and it is not firm in the fork.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other servant holds the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then cover over the head of the weak one, and under his chin, a thin bandage, firm: and extend the end of the bandage to the wood which is near his head: and tie it in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tie a ligament above the ankle of that person, and above their knees, and at their hips.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments and tie them on another wood that is by his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let every servant stretch to the part of the wood where the ligament is tied, and do not remove the two woods from their places where they are fixed; however, they should not be tightened as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor puts his hands on the Spondylum with force, until he returns; or he puts a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he attaches his feet to the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And cut in the wall from which we said that it is near the sick person, the place where the end of the board should enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then put the middle of the board on the Spondylum.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the doctor puts his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he ties well, until the Spondylus is bound and he returns to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you want, operate with the chisel that is wrapped with your hand: and it is, so that you carve in the ground near the head of the sick person at the end of his foot two woods, whose length is an arm: and at the head of his foot at the end of his foot two woods.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length be what is between every wood a foot: and now it is made in every place a hole through which the chisel ran: and the wood is firmly fixed in the ground much, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And the round wood is inserted: and there is a chisel in which the ligament is rolled on two holes of two woods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which the wood is supported, whose length is a foot with that which bends back: and in two other pieces of wood there is similarly that one.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tie the cords that you tied in the chest of the weak person with a bandage that is at its head: and the cords that you tied in its legs with a bandage that is at its feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by every bandage minister, who twists his hand with the roller, with which the bandage is rolled: and the doctor balances the Spondyle, as we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the bandage that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then when the Spondyle returns, and the place is balanced, then you should put on a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then cotton.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then put above the plaster a stall from the board, whose width is three fingers, or about them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the amount that will take the place of the Gibbus, and on the part of the healthy Spondyle.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the cord that we said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the weak person uses delicate food until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something remains prominent in the place at the end of healing: then you should give medicines that soften and relieve, with the administration of the board that we mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now it is administered in that lead sheet.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a prominence occurs in the last Spondyle of the back: and it is thought to be dislocated through that, and that is the bone that already protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not necessary to make a presumption about him with this medicine: perhaps he will cause death to happen.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Chapter on the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that dislocations of the ankle and elbow joints do not occur except from a dislocation alone, and they do not suffer from the same problems as other joints due to a slight removal or hollowing.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	Indeed, the ankle joint is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is because it is dislocated towards the front and back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	It is most commonly dislocated inward, and slightly outward towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment for an inward dislocation is as follows: when you join the infirm leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the knee of the infirm leg is higher than that of the healthy one, and it cannot double its foot near the groin. There is also a location following the groin that becomes swollen due to heat, because the hip joint has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	The sign of an outward dislocation is that its symptoms are the opposite of those mentioned above.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	The sign of an outward dislocation towards the front is that it stretches the healthy leg to its full extent, but does not double it without pain in the knee. If it tries to walk, it cannot step forward, and it retains urine and becomes swollen in the groin, and there is a cracking sound when walking on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of an outward dislocation towards the back is that it does not stretch the knee and cannot double it before doubling the groin. The leg is also shorter on that side, and the groin is softened, and the hip joint has reached there.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this type of dislocation is as follows: you should consider whether it is an old dislocation that has already existed for a long time in the person having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	If you have administered reduction to it and it remains in its original position, then there is no treatment at all for it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not necessary to make a complete assumption about it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in the case of a recent dislocation of one of the four types, you should act quickly to reduce it by rolling the joint, extending it to both the interior and exterior, and moving it with your right and left hands: perhaps it will return to its original position and not require any other treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If it does not return to its original position in this way, then you must prepare a strong assistant and extend the leg from the lower part: with his hands or with a bandage that is tied above the leg over the knee: and another assistant extends his hand above, so that his hands can be inserted under the tissues.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie a loose bandage over the root of the thigh and hold the end of the other ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And there should be extension from the front of the groin to the backbone or from the back to the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And there should be extension of all of them with equal force until the injured person is raised up from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	For this is the common form of extension among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If it returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary to do the following for each type of treatment that I will say about its proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the proper reduction of it when the dislocation is to the inside, the injured person should be laid on his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should place the bandage over the root of the thigh, in the place between the hip joint and the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he should extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the backbone.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another assistant take hold of her strong arms, and reduce the rough swelling at the weak hip, and extend it towards the outer parts with a vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For now she returns to her place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this appearance is easier than the other forms of treatment that reduce this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if she excuses herself to you, and does not obey you to enter with this form of treatment at all: then it is necessary that two weak feet are tied together with a strong but gentle bandage, above the two heels, and on the two knees: and the length of each should be equal to four fingers from its opposite: and the weak leg should be extended more than the other by the length of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the weak one be suspended above the head of the beam, which is in the house: and its length should be equal to the length of two arms from the ground.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the strong young man to protect the hip joint: and let the weak one be suspended with another assistant: and let another young man push him, protecting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in its own reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outer parts, it is necessary that the weak one lies on the footstool, as we mentioned for him who has stiffness.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the ligament is tied above the weak leg, and on his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two beams are placed, one by his feet, and the other by his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a beam is placed added in the middle of his foot, fixed well: above which are wrapped wet cloths, so that it does not harm the weak one: and the beam should be between his hips, so that it is not pulled downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then every assistant should extend to his own part, and the doctor should equal the reduction by his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore he obeys the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, put it on that table, and press it evenly, as we said in the lameness, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick person should lie on his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the anterior, then it is necessary that the sick leg should be extended quickly: and it is according to this same story on the footstool: and the doctor should put his right hand palm down on the sick person's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should enclose him with his other hand, and with that enclosure put him stretched out to the lower parts to the part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the posterior, then it is not necessary that the sick person should be stretched out to the lower parts, and he should be raised up on the ground: but it is necessary that he should be placed on something hard, as it is made even if his ankle is dislocated to the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two ankles: and it is on his face, and the tendons are stretched: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression should be given with the table even on the place from which he goes out at the joint, when the reduction is completed according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his reduction is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend both sick legs: and when you see them equal, and the sick person draws back his leg, and he expands it without excuse: then you know that the member has already returned, according to what is necessary: then join two hips, and put on a plaster, and bind with imemati, that is, a wheel: so that the ankle does not move to any part: and the sick person should stick quietly for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then dissolve the ligament, and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: if you see them equal in state, then you will know that the dislocation has been restored: therefore complete the weak one for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see anything softening: then return, and apply the plaster to it, and tie it according to your first tension: and let it go for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then dissolve it and make it slow in walking on both sides for several days until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Concerning the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated to the outsides, to the insides, and to the lower parts, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the weak one to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not stick to the hip, then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all its dislocations is to make the weak one sit straight, so that he can extend his leg if possible over it, and stick his back to his face: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then stick the knee with your hands, and straighten them between your fingers over the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your hand two sides of the knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another servant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg sticks to the hip in ease, not with labor.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it, and make the leg stick to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then tie it together with the wound and the dressing for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then dissolve it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And do not use weak walking for several days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if he refuses to reduce it to you, then apply strong extension with bandages, of which the description is given in the treatment of fractures, until he returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	¶ On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Heel Bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone sometimes moves slightly and sometimes dislocates completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation is to the inside or outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone inflated, protruding towards the part to which it dislocates.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	But its treatment of removal is easy: and it is, that it is extended with ease with the hands, and adjusted, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	But in its treatment when it dislocates completely, you must do that the sick person sits straight up: and he holds him strong very from the back part of his back, in the middle of him.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold you with your right hand your foot from the upper part of him, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot in the place of the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull his foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left hand twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with your left hand, and push the foot's chest with your right towards the leg without labor.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the foot's chest towards the leg in the third pull, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	But if it returns in the first pull, or in two according to this way, and you see the foot even, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on him: because he returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, you are prohibited from reducing him with the method we have described, then let the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and firmly fix a staff in the ground, so that he falls between his buttocks; and you have already uncovered him above the cloth, so that he does not hurt the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take hold of his buttocks: afterwards, let the assistant extend one foot, or with his hands, or with a bandage that ties around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the assistants extend against the extension of their own counterforce: and the staff should stand between the two buttocks of the sick person, retaining him, so that his body is not drawn to his lower parts during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor equalizes the dislocation with his hands, and the assistant holds the healthy leg towards the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and its health is declared to you: then place a plaster and bandage, and bind it firmly with bands, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you be careful of the hollows or fear the nerves, which are above the heel posterior, so that there is not a strong bandage over them, and they do not hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage becomes soft, bind him again: then dissolve it on the third day, or fourth: and prohibit the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If however he attempts to walk before that space, there is no safety that the dislocation does not dissolve on him, and it is corrupted, and he does not receive after that cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If however a hot abscess occurs to him: then it is necessary that the attendant in his sedation that preceded our narrative in another place from cure, and ointment, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On Dislocation of the Toes of the Foot and its Treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary to put back into place what has been dislocated from among them with extension, a few without difficulty: and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in certain knots of the arch of the foot, then it is necessary for the sick person to sit with his foot on an equal level with the ground, or on a board: and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot on that which projects from among those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then you step on it with your foot with strength, until it returns, and you see that it is now equal, and there is no projection in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the sole of his foot a board which can hold the whole foot, with two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a decent bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then you loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bandaged and secured from the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the kinds of dislocation with a wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens to him and you try to cure him and restore him, death often follows: and for this reason it is not necessary for one to presume on the cure of his wound, which is of this kind, unless he is wise in the art of long use, merciful, pious, slow, not audacious, nor presumptuous: and that he uses in the reception of medicines which only calm inflammations hot only: and he leaves the sick for a long time to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for health from the danger with the alleviation of pain, and in which something appears to be hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the member returns as we wish, then administer the regimen that calms the abscess: and care for the wound along with what is suitable for it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If however the dislocation is with fracture, and it occurs in the separated bones of the jaw, then attempt the removal of them, and do in it what we said in simple afflictions from that which preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the way of fear: according to what preceded my preaching to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and more saving to your body among them in your time.
