Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On the treatment of unopened anal fistula.
Many boys are born with their anuses unopened, blocked by a thin membrane. The midwife should perforate this membrane with her finger, or else incise it with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.
Then she should place on it wool dipped in wine and oil, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear it will close, place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it whenever the child needs to defecate.
Blockage of the anus can also occur from the healing of a wound or swelling.  This healed area should be incised, then treated with the aforementioned remedies and lead tube.
