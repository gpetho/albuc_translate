On cauterization for sciatica.	On the Method of Cauterizing for Sciatica	0.67722416
When pain occurs in the hip joint and is due to cold and humidities, and the patient has been treated by those means mentioned in the section, and the treatment is ineffectual, and the pain becomes chronic, the patient should be purged of the heavy humours with foetid pills or pills of tamarind or the like; then cauterize him.	When pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and moisture, and the patient has been treated with the methods described earlier, but no cure is achieved, and the pain becomes chronic, it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors using fetid pills, artificial pills, or similar remedies. Then proceed to cauterize the patient.	0.8624698
The means of cauterization in this case is twofold: either with caustic chemicals or with fire.	There are two methods for cauterization in this case: cauterization with caustic medicines or cauterization with fire.	0.9027672
The actual cautery will serve for several methods.	Cauterization with fire can be done in several ways.	0.57236886
One of them is to make three cauterizations over the femoral joint itself in a triangular manner ; and let them be of a fair depth; and the space between them a finger's breadth. The cautery should be an olivary one.	One method is to apply three triangular cauterizations over the hip joint, arranged in this form. Make the cauterizations either deep or shallow, as necessary. Allow a finger’s width of space between each cauterization, and use an olive-shaped cautery.	0.7965838
Sometimes there will also be one cauterization in the middle over the actual head of the femur, making four cauterizations in all.	Sometimes, a single cauterization is also applied in the center over the head of the hip joint. Thus, there will be four cauterizations in total.	0.88318205
The burning may be done with the circular cautery which has been mentioned under cauterization of a dislocated hip; a single cauterization so that the circle embrace the whole joint.	If you prefer, you may use a circular cautery as described in the treatment for hip dislocation, forming a circle around the entire hip joint.	0.62515986
Burn through the whole thickness of the skin.	Burn through the entire thickness of the skin.	0.9989457
This is the form of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized in the hip joint and does not extend to the femur and the leg.	This is the method for cauterizing sciatica when the pain is localized in the hip and does not extend to the thigh or leg.	0.89604557
But if it extends to the femur and the leg, cauterize him over the thigh with two burns at the place where the patient indicates the pain to be; and one burn four fingers above the great tendon of the heel, a little to the outer side.	If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, apply two cauterizations on the thigh at the point indicated by the patient where the pain is located, and place another cautery on the ankle, about four fingers’ width toward the outside. Use a knife-shaped cautery.	0.8372143
The cautery should be edged, and the depth of the burn only to the thickness of the skin.	Ensure the cautery penetrates to the full thickness of the skin.	0.48142713
But if the patient points out that the pain reaches to the toes, then cauterize where he has indicated to you, with a punctate cautery, three or four or more perforations if he needs it.	If the patient indicates that the pain extends to the toes, apply three, four, or more point cauterizations at the points indicated by the patient, if necessary.	0.8514701
If he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the shank, give him one burn there with the edged cautery.	If the patient points to pain below the knee toward the leg, apply a single knife-shaped cautery there.	0.74463564
Be careful in all your cauterizing not to carry the cautery so far as to burn a nerve or a large artery; for thence arises grave harm, or crippling, to the patient.	In all cauterizations, be cautious not to apply the cautery too deeply to avoid burning any nerve or major artery, which could cause severe harm or lead to contraction in the patient.	0.87283945
I myself have seen more than one person cauterizing over the tendon of Achilles, the cauterization being excessive, and the leg was affected with a defluxion of humours which eventually reached the foot and the whole was riddled; after that came diarrhoea, and, after that, death.	I have witnessed cases where practitioners cauterized above the ankle and applied the cautery too deeply, causing the leg to swell until the swelling reached the foot, leading to the entire foot becoming perforated and necrotic; following this, the patient experienced abdominal distress and ultimately died.	0.7310053
If there is pain in two places, cauterize both in this way.	If the pain is present on both sides simultaneously, cauterize each side in this manner.	0.8482615
Certain learned doctors have mentioned a cauterization applicable to the hip in this manner: make a bowl of iron with a diameter of half a span; the thickness of the edge of its mouth should be that of a date-stone or a little less. Another bowl is introduced into this, and a third into that; and there is a distance between the bowls of a thumb-joint.	Certain learned practitioners have suggested the following method for hip cauterization. Create a cautery tool from iron resembling a double samium. Its diameter should be half a palm's width, with an opening about the width of a date stone, or slightly less. Within it, place a third samium.	0.83189017
The bowls are open on both sides; and the depth of them should be a thumb-joint or two. Make an iron handle for them firmly fitted to the bowls.	Ensure there is a space between each samium about the size of a thumb joint. These sami should be open on both ends, with a height of about one or two thumb joints. Attach an iron handle suitably fitted to the sami.	0.7691371
Then heat this cautery in the fire until it is hot and sends out sparks; and so let it be applied to the hip, the patient lying on his sound side; and thus three circular cauterizations will be produced at a time.	Then, heat it in the fire until it becomes red-hot and emits sparks. Place it on the hip joint of the patient while they lie on their healthy side. Thus, cauterize with three round cauterizations in a single session.	0.84514624
Afterwards let it be for three days; then smear with butter and leave the wound open for a while; then treat with ointment till it heals.	Afterward, leave the wound undisturbed for three days. Then apply a butter-based plaster and leave the wound open for several days. Finally, treat the wound with ointment until it heals completely.	0.8687264
The author of this book says that we very rarely employ this method of cauterization on account of the ugliness and dread appearance of it, and because we find few patients who will endure it.	Albucasis says, "My son, we have rarely used this type of cautery because of the intimidating appearance and the lack of patients willing to undergo it."	0.6670208
Nevertheless, it is one of the best cauteries for him who can endure it and is correctly treated by it.	Nevertheless, it is one of the most effective cauteries for those who can endure it and whose condition warrants its application.	0.7969401
Cauterization with caustics is thus: make two bowls like the ring into which a door-hinge descends, either of bronze or iron.	For cauterization with caustic medicines, make two small devices with a perforated ring through which a pivot made of brass or iron passes, the length of which is about two thumb joints.	0.6572252
The height of their sides should be two thumb-joints or thereabouts, and they should be separated about a finger's breadth; they should be open above and below, and joined one to another thus.	There should be a space between the devices approximately the width of a finger, and they should be open at the top and bottom, aligning in this arrangement.	0.69639736
Then place them over the capsule of the hip joint, the patient lying upon his sound side, and press down hard; then pour caustic fluid between the two rings—it should have been heated slightly—and keep it there for the space of one hour by the sand-clock. The patient must endure the sting and heat of it (for he will find it stings like fire) till the causticity diminishes.	Place this over the hip joint of the patient as they lie on the healthy side. Press firmly over the hip joint with your hand. Then, pour warm water heated over a flame between the two rings, maintaining the heat for about an hour. The patient will feel a biting pain like fire, which they must endure until it subsides.	0.8331759
Then remove your hand with the instrument and wash away the caustic from the whole capsule with pure water.	Afterward, remove your hand and the device, wipe away the hot water with fresh water, and leave the area undisturbed for three days.	0.5327686
Let be for three days and apply butter to it till the eschar comes away; and let the pus flow from it for a few days, for that will be more conducive to healing.	Apply butter to the area until the burned skin turns black, and allow it to rest for several days, during which pus will begin to flow. This process provides the most lasting relief.	0.61275613
Then treat with ointment till it heals.	Then, treat it with ointments until it fully heals.	0.89177567
If the pain extends to the hip joint or the leg, make a form in some material that will hold the fluid for that, just as you did for the capsule of the femur.	If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, perform the same procedure with the water application on that area as you did on the hip.	0.72282755
Place under that pot another one, glazed. Pour enough water on the quicklime and potash to cover them to a finger's breadth after you have pressed them well together with your hand; and leave the pot until the caustic fluid has passed down into the bottom of the glazed pot.	Take equal parts of alkali and quicklime, grind them thoroughly, and place them in a new pot with a small hole at the bottom, just large enough for a rod to pass through. Place a glass vessel underneath, then pour fresh water over the alkali and lime to cover them by about a finger's width. Press down firmly with your hand and allow the liquid to drain into the glass vessel below.	0.77901584
Then collect all that fluid and pour it upon a fresh lot of lime and potash.	Collect all this liquid, pour it over a new portion of lime, and filter it to renew its potency.	0.64388317
Thus will the water be very caustic indeed. This is used for many medical procedures and for the cauterization of all members, as it has the very same action as fire itself.	This solution will be highly caustic and suitable for many medical applications, including cauterizing other parts of the body. It effectively replicates the action of fire.	0.71269834
There are other drugs too with which the capsule of the femur is cauterized, such as Thapsia and Mel Anacardinum and inunction of lime with soap.	Other medicinal substances used for cauterizing the hip include tesesi, cashew honey, and lime mixed with soap, all combined for maximum efficacy.	0.57453895
Galen, quoting one of the men of old, mentions a treatment for pain in the thigh and sciatica and he makes much of it, asserting that no other treatment was necessary, and that it would heal on one application, so much so that the patient would be carried into the bath and would go out completely cured.	Galen, recounting the treatment of an ancient man cured of hip pain and sciatica, highly praised this method. He said that the man needed no further treatment and was cured after a single session, even claiming that the patient entered the bath in pain and emerged fully healed.	0.841097
The method is as follows: take fresh green water-cress or new dry water-cress if fresh is not to be had; beat it up well with some fat and apply it to the hip where it hurts, or to the leg or thigh, and bind up.	The treatment involves using fresh seitaragi (a specific medicinal plant), or, if unavailable, a dried, recent sample. Grind it thoroughly with some fat, apply it to the hip, leg, or thigh where the pain is located, then bind and leave it in place for about three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning.	0.62914824
Then let be for three hours or until the patient feels a diminishing of the caustic; and then let him be taken to the bath.	Then, have the patient enter a bath.	0.43204978
When his body is bedewed with sweat, get him into the pool; then the pain will vanish and he will be cured.	Once their body is perspiring, immerse them in a basin. The pain will subside, and healing will occur.	0.8180533
But you must know that no one should have cauterization with these drugs except after evacuation of the bowel.	Be aware that cauterization should not be combined with these treatments until the body has been purged.	0.65199625
Dioscorides has said that cauterization with goats' dung is beneficial for sciatica. The cauterization is carried out in this manner: take wool soaked in old oil and put it into the cleft which is between the thumb and the forearm but nearer to the forearm.	Dioscorides stated that goat dung, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, provides relief. The cautery is applied as follows: Take some wool, soak it in old oil, and place it over the depression between the big toe and the arch, near the ankle.	0.8776263
Then take the dried dung of a goat and expose it to fire until it glows like a coal.	Then take dried goat dung, ignite it in fire until it turns to charcoal.	0.8691081
Place it on the piece of wool, and leave till it cools, then replace it with another, and so on until the sensation has reached the hip joint by way of the forearm, and the pain stops.	Continue this until the sensation extends along the pathway to the hip and the pain subsides.	0.54041946
This kind of cautery is called 'the dung cautery'.	This method is known as the "Cow Cautery."	0.65239537
