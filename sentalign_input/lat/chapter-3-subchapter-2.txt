On fractures occurring in the head.
Chapter III.
The types of fractures are diverse, and their forms are many, and their causes are distinct.
There is a type of fracture that occurs from a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the entire bone until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone, just as an ax does in wood; because of this, this type of fracture is called Axial.
Or a sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts its surface, but the cut does not penetrate to its depth: and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a simple Lifting.
And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
And there is a fracture which is a crushing or abrasion: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone, or something similar.
And this fracture is either penetrating, which is already approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone: and the wound from these two types of fractures can also be either small or large.
And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the thinness of a hair: it is a small fissure, and for this reason, this type of fracture is called Capillary.
And there is a fracture that occurs from a fall, or a blow with a stone, or something similar, which causes a layer of the bone to enter inward, creating a hollow in the area: just as happens to copper cauldrons, when they are struck, and a part of them goes inward.
And this most often happens in heads with soft bones, as in the heads of children.
And in all these types of fractures, separate steps are needed, and I will address each of them in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by examining them, and by probing them with tenting, and by removing the corrupted flesh that is upon them.
But the Capillary type is recognized by exposing the bone, wiping it, and applying ink over it: for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of the fracture, first consider the symptoms of the patient: then if you see among the symptoms a clear sign of danger, such as vomiting bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging of the eyes, redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms in various conditions, there is no doubt it is incurable: but if you observe non-threatening symptoms, and you hope for recovery, then begin treatment.
That is, if the wounded person comes to you immediately when wounded: and it is during the days of winter, then you should take care to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, following all preparations.
And if it is during the days of summer, then you must hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane beneath the bone becomes corrupted, and those symptoms we have mentioned occur.
But if the bone fracture has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and is accompanied by fragments and pulling, then you must cut away the shattered and damaged part, as I instruct you.
This means you shave the head of the wounded: and expose the bone in whatever way possible for you, according to the shape of the wound, and whatever is least distressing for the patient.
If, upon exposing the bone, there occurs a flow of blood, or a warm swelling, then apply what is necessary to it.
This is to fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and you let the wound rest until the swelling subsides, and you are safe from bleeding.
Then begin treating the bone, and removing it.
And this is done according to one of two methods.
One method is to cut the bone with a knife of sharp edge: and this is its form.
Then use another knife after the first, slightly wider than it: and this is its form.
Then use yet another knife, even wider than the second.
And the second method is that you have a number of different knives: some of which are wider than others, and some shorter than others; and let the ends of their tips be sharp, and let them be made of Indian steel or hardened steel: and strike lightly upon the knife, so that it does not shake or injure the head.
But if the bone is strong and hard, then you must drill around it, before you apply the knives, with drills called "non-penetrating drills": and they are called this because they do not go past the boundary of the bone to the tissue behind it; for the drill has a rounded end over the sharp head, like a border, and a small ring prevents it from going deep and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is suitable for you to take a large number of these drills, each corresponding to the thickness of the bone, so that for any skull you have the appropriate drill: with the length and width of its sharp tip matching the thickness of that skull.
And this is the form of three types of drills, or trepans.
The manner of drilling around the broken bone is to place the drill on the bone, and rotate it with your fingers, until you know that the bone is already penetrated.
Then move the drill to another spot, and place between each hole the width of a finger, or about that distance.
Then cut with the knives the bone between each hole: and do this as finely as you can, with gentle precision, as we said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with some other instrument you have prepared for this: like small forceps and fine scissors.
And you must take every caution that the drill or knife does not touch any part of the membrane.
When you have drilled around the bone, and it has been separated from the membrane, if it is attached to it and you have removed it, you should shave and smooth the edge of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to a knife.
However, it should be thinner and more delicate than the other knives.
If there remain any small bones or fragments, then remove them carefully with whatever instrument you have at hand.
Then treat the wound afterward with lint and ointments as we have described.
And another method of operation is easy, entirely free from fear: which Galen mentioned and praised highly, and this is his description.
It is necessary for you to begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and apparent: so that, when you have exposed that part, you place under it the end of this lenticular knife, of which this is the form.
And the lenticular part, smooth, does not cut anything: and its sharp part goes lengthwise on two sides, as you see: so that the lenticular part rests upon the membrane, with its sharp side cutting the bone.
Then strike on one side of the knife with a small hammer, until you cut the whole bone with ease, as it rotates: and you can be certain regarding the membrane, that nothing will happen to it that would cause you fear at all.
And if the doctor were not the most foolish or ignorant of men, nor asleep, then if anything from the membrane remained attached to the bone in certain places, he would cut it away from there with the tip of his lenticular knife, and free it from there with ease.
For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the membrane, and what is removed from the bone is its surface, and slight roughness and small fragments remain on it: then it is necessary to shave that roughness and remove those fragments with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number in various sizes, so that you are able to use whichever is most suitable and appropriate in every place, according to what the operation leads you to and the shape of the broken bone.
And you should begin your rasping with the widest of those rasps.
Then use after it one that is finer.
And do not stop doing this in sequence, until you reach using the finest and most delicate of them all.
And in each of the remaining small cracks or hairline fractures, and in slight fractures, it is necessary to apply care according to what will bring it to proper alignment.
And this is something that is not hidden from anyone who has any experience in this art and has followed what we have written and demonstrated regarding major fractures.
But if the exposed membrane remains intact when you remove the bone, then you should take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Then take another cloth folded double or triple, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do this as gently as you can over it, so that the membrane is not burdened.
Then place a wide bandage over it: and do not tighten it, except to the degree that it holds the wound only: and leave it with this care for a day or two, until you are free from the risk of a hot abscess.
Then loosen it, and afterwards apply medicines that provide excess dryness: such as lily roots, flour of herbs, frankincense powder, birthwort, and the like: and you should make a powder from these medicines, which is sprinkled over the wound while they are dry.
And generally, administer any medicine to it whose property is to cleanse without biting.
And take care, to the best of your ability, that the wound in your treatment remains clear: let there be no filth of ointment or foulness.
Do not allow any pus to gather there at all: for when pus gathers over the cerebral membrane, it corrupts it and decays it, and a great affliction befalls the patient afterward: and it has already happened in the membrane of the head, when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, that blackening occurs on its surface.
Therefore, consider then, if the patient suffers from the symptoms we have mentioned, you will know without a doubt that it is dangerous.
And if blackening occurs only from the medicine applied to it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackening, then it is necessary to take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and dip a cloth in them.
Then place it over the membrane: afterwards, treat it with appropriate healing substances until it heals.
