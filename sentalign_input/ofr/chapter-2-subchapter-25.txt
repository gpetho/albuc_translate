of the flesh on the nose
Often a disease arises at the tip of the nose which is called "telul," and grows and becomes increasingly large, until it is a hideous thing to look at;
and therefore you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it all away, then put on the spot the cautery or the burning medicine;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of a dark color, of little feeling:
do not touch it with iron for it is a cancerous abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not of a dark color, and you see that it can be completely cut out, then bleed the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the area with drying and astringent things.
