of castration
Know that castration is condemned in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the physician should know how to answer when asked about it, and know the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways:
either by pulling, or by cutting.
In the one that we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging down;
then take them in your hand, until they are drawn back and you no longer feel them.
On castration by cutting:
you must restrain the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the spermatic cord, and cut each testicle with one cut, once you have skinned them well;
and leave there some of the thick and thin membranes which are on the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by pulling, because with pulling, some part of the testicles might remain, by which the animal still desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
