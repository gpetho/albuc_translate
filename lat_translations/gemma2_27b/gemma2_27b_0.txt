Praefatio.	Preface. 
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed for you, O sons, this book, which is the last of medical science with its complement, and I have reached the end in it from its expositions and its declarations, it seemed good to me to complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is surgery with the hand. 
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since operation with the hand is prostrate in our region and time utterly private: until perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and the trace of it was cut off: and there remained nothing from it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands changed: and error and hesitation befell them, until its intentions were closed and its force lengthened: It seemed good to me to revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise in it according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation: and to come with the forms of instruments of the Cautery, and the rest of the operative instruments: with it being done from the addition of declaration, and its proper execution.  
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The cause however for which a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise himself before that in the science of anatomy as Galen narrated, until he knows the joints of the limbs, and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, and their number, and their egress, and veins pulsatile and quiet, and places of their exit. 
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for that Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work it is little, and especially in the art of the hand. 
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We however already said of that in the introduction to this book.  
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is not knowing what we said of anatomy, is not purged, but rather falls into error by which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed from this science and boast themselves of it without knowledge, and without experiment.  
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	Which is because I saw a foolish physician dissect a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and he cut into some arteries in her neck; therefore the woman bled until she fell dead between his hands. 
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in age, and the stone was large. 
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore arrived at him and extracted it with a piece of the bladder. 
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day. 
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I indeed had already been summoned to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the weak man that he would die. 
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was receiving a fee from a certain Duke in our land for medicine; and it happened that a black eunuch who was with him suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel; and the physician hurried with his ignorance and bound the fracture over the wound with lint and bandages, and a tight constriction, and did not allow the wound to breathe. 
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his wishes.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he dismissed him after several days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage; and it remained so until his leg and foot became abscessed and reached destruction. 
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore summoned to him; and I hurried to loosen the bandage; and there followed quietude, and he escaped from his pains. 
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb and I was not able to restrain it.  
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Put therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until it died. 
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous abscess; and it became ulcerated afterwards until the malice of it was magnified with its master. 
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	Which is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all unless it is in a limb which can tolerate it so that the whole of it may be cut off. 
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, O Sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation which is associated with health; and the operation with which there is danger in many conditions. 
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already roused in every place of this book where the operation comes which is fraught with terror and fear.  
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to be cautious about that and divide it so that foolish people do not find a way to speak and dishonor. 
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore accept the measure with solicitude and protection, and your infirm patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to salvation and praiseworthy succession; and dismiss terrible ailments of difficult healing; and lift up your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon you in your faith and well-being. 
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more enduring for your glory, and more sublime in this world, and lastly for your quantities. 
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.  
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad ailment lest you be called a bad doctor. 
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	But I have now divided this treatise according to three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cautery with fire, and cautery with sharp medicine, chaptered and ordered from the head to the feet, and forms of instruments and tools for cautery; and everything necessary in the operation. 
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two. 
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On incision and perforation, phlebotomy and venesections, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and things similar to that; and wholly chaptered, ordered according to the forms of instruments. 
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three.  
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of torsion, and things similar to that; chaptered, ordered from the head to the feet, and according to the forms of instruments. 
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone. 
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis. 
Pars I.	Part I. 
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning cautery and its harm; to which complexions it suits and at what time; and whether with iron or gold. 
Caput I.	Chapter I. 
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the operations with it, it is necessary to say what its qualities of benefits and harms are, and in which complexion it is exhibited. 
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	Therefore I say that speech concerning the quality of cautery's benefit and its harm is a lengthy and subtle science and hidden secret. 
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Indeed, many wise men have spoken on this matter and disagreed; and it suffices me to speak a little from their words, fearing delay. 
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	Therefore I say that cautery is applied universally to every complexion which has matter and is without matter, except for two complexions, which are a hot complexion without matter and a dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However in the hot and dry complexion with matter they disagreed. 
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cautery is beneficial in it. 
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in illness which is from heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat; and it is unsuitable for something hot and dry to heal a hot and dry illness. 
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of that said: that benefit is done through cautery in every hot and dry illness which occurs in the bodies of men; because when you compare the body of a man and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say through his speech: because experience has already shown me that many times. 
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However it is not necessary for that to come about unless one who has already been proven and practiced in the ultimate exercise of cautery, and has known the diversity of complexions of men, and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the space of time of them. 
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But there is no fear for you from the remaining complexions; and especially in cold and moist illnesses. 
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have now agreed upon them, and they did not disagree about cautery for them. 
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of treatment by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with a burning medicine, is because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member that you are cauterizing; and it does not harm another joined member, except for slight harm. 
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But the action of burning medicine reaches that which extends from the members; and perhaps it causes illness of difficult healing to occur in the member, and perhaps it kills it. 
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, on account of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.  
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Indeed it has now become clear to us through experimentation, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things; and on account of that I excuse myself from the length of speech. 
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not because it is not permitted for this book of mine to bring to you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies in its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses through philosophical discourse demonstrated, which would agree with your minds. 
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they themselves disagree on the time in which it is fitting to perform cautery, and they establish a better time for truth. 
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is fitting at all times; because the harm that happens because of time is submerged in the benefit, which is attracted with cautery. 
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary pains, strong, urgent, which do not tolerate delay; because it is feared from them that a greater evil may happen, than a small harm entering because of time. 
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let it not enter your minds, O sons, that which the common and foolish physicians do not esteem, namely that to the disease which is healed by cautery, there is not always a return; they suppose this consequence, but the matter is not as they think, because cautery is nothing but medicine applied in a place, which alters the complexion and dries up the humidities which are the causes of pain. 
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cautery surpasses medicine by the swiftness of its healing, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion; and it is possible that the illness may return at some hour according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and its power: and that which is prepared in his body from an aggregation of superfluities therein, and which reaches him in its acquisition from foods, and things like them from causes, unless it becomes an illness in which cautery is administered. 
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Illness subtle in a limb of few superfluities and humidities, such as cautery of the tooth on account of pain and similar things to it, for it is possible that the pain will not return therein. 
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this happens rarely. 
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly the common saying again that cautery is the last of medicine is a right statement; not to what they intend therein, for they believe that there is no cure which agrees with medicine nor with another after the setting of the cautery. 
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The matter is on the contrary to that, and the intention that cautery is the last of medicine is not except when we administer modes of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not agree; then afterwards we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it agrees; then from this it falls that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand. 
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except on account of the equality of gold and the exaltation of its substance; and they said that it does not make pus in the place of the cautery.  
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true: for I myself have already proven it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others. 
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And a cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said. 
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you make a cautery fire out of gold, it is not declared to you when it is ignited according to the amount you wish, because of the redness of the gold; and when cold rushes to it, and if you add fire on top of it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets. 
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the craftsman falls from it into occupation; and because of that a cautery with iron is made among us quicker and closer, out of straightness for the operation. 
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I myself have now arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters; and I have arranged those things from the head down to the feet: so that it may relieve one seeking that which he wants from it. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the way of cauterizing the Head in the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.  
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization applies to the dominion of humidity and coldness over the brain: which are two causes of headaches, and a multitude of flows of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally all illnesses, which happen from coldness, such as paralysis, and headaches, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses. 
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you should advise the sick person: that he evacuate in the first place with medicinal purgatives cleansing the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the sick person requires, and his age, and his habit.  
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then advise him that he make his head bare with a razor. 
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have him sit between your hands in a square way, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest. 
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes. 
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Therefore wherever your middle finger shall arrive, mark that spot with a cautery. 
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then a cautery with olive oil: which has this shape. 
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it upon the spot marked with the cautery, with a downward motion, whereby your hand shall be gradually constricted, and you shall revolve it. 
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand and look at the spot. 
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	And if you see that a quantity equal to the head of an awl or the size of rue has already been exposed from the bone, then lift your hand. 
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the same iron or with another if it becomes cold, until you see the bones which I told you.  
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and imbibe the cotton in it, and place it upon the spot, and leave it for three days. 
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place cotton imbued with butter upon it, and leave it upon the spot until the burn is destroyed.  
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with tetrapharmakon ointment until it heals. 
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Now they have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits, therefore it is better and more beneficial. 
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is scorched. 
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then after that which has been scorched is scraped from the bone, it shall then be cared for.  
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary with the cautery to reach the very end until it imprints a shape upon the bone so that the bone falls, which is done like the shape of a kirate: or an instrument which women put in with a small alphabet infused; and they consider that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time. 
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be cared for until it becomes consolidated. 
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But these two kinds of cautery do not seem to me to be anything other than according to the way of fear in certain people. 
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And it is better for me to dismiss him, with his health. 
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head of a weak and frail person is infirm; and indeed the first kind of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it; therefore operate with it in safety.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head. 
Caput III.	Chapter III. 
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head and it is prolonged in a weak person, and they use leeches, cupping glasses, purgatives, oils, and poultices. 
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and nothing is conferred upon him from those things, then consider. 
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of a weak person is strong by nature and is not frail, and it finds intense cold, then cauterize with another cautery under that one a little.  
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize him over the whole horn of his head with a cautery, so that it does not go through the skin, and uncover a quantity from the bone as we have described.  
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with one cautery on the back of his head, in a place called the vas; and it is the place where windy currents are placed; and elevate your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone. 
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak person finds on account of that intense pain, and different from the pain of all the other head cauteries.  
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say this cautery in its place; and it is necessary that it be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle of the head is cauterized. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cauterizing for headache, both with medicinal burning agents and with iron. 
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV. 
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends as far as the eye, and the head is cleansed with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment, which I have mentioned in the divisions of diseases, is administered, and that does not bring it all together: then cauterization is applied in this case according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicinal agent; or with iron. 
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cauterization, however, with a sharp burning medicinal agent is done as follows: you take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.  
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then split the area of pain at a time when bloodletting is wide, until a place under the skin is made where the clove is gripped. 
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore insert it just under the skin until it is concealed; then bind over it with a bandage of decent constriction and leave it for fifteen hours; then loosen it and remove the garlic, and let the wound rest for two or three days; afterwards apply a poultice soaked in butter over it until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it heals. 
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, On Burning Medicines. 
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization of it with iron, however, is done in this way.  
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Heat a cautery, which has this shape. 
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a Clavis because the shape of its head is like the shape of a key, in which there is a certain curve, and in the middle of it there is a small prominence. 
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it upon the spot and hold your hand steady; and rotate the iron gradually with speed; and let the quantity that is cauterized be half the thickness of the skin.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that the artery below is not injured and blood flow occurs. 
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a swab in salt water and place it on the spot and leave it for three days; then put the swab with butter; afterwards treat with ointment until it is healed. 
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicranium with the second blade end of the cautery. 
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting an artery in this hemicranium, not an old one properly. 
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the way of cauterizing an old hemicranium.  
Caput V.	Chapter Five. 
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a hemicranium with what we said from the preceding treatment and what we said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not take effect; and you see from the ailment that it is not sufficient for it what we said from the first cautery with medicine, or with fire cautery, then it is necessary to ignite the knife cautery until it whitens after you make a line on the place of pain, whose length is half a finger, or something like that; and place your hand with one finger, and squeeze it until you hit the artery and reach the mouth. 
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However it is necessary for you to be careful of the continuation of the jawbone which moves at mastication so that the side or the nerve which moves it is not injured, from which a spasm may occur.  
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be careful and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut. 
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For there is fear in its cutting off, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious nor experienced; and he abandons the operation with it at first.  
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a reminder of managing the flow of blood occurring from an artery according to its own way and in its place in this book. 
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the illness that this cautery is not enough for it, and you see a weak body tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head as we have described, care for the wound until it heals. 
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, apply the cautery that we said in the chapter on extraction of an artery with a cautery having two knives. 
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more effective. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing for ear pain. 
Caput VI.	Chapter Six. 
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When ear pain occurs from cold and is treated with solutions and the remaining treatment as we said in the division, and the pain does not go away, then apply heat with a cautery; and it is that which is called a Point, its shape is this. 
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then make points with it after igniting it around the entire ear, as it revolves: or around both if there is pain in both at the same time. 
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And hold the cautery away from the root of the ear a little after you have marked the places with an ointment: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points in each ear, and like that. 
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the places until they heal. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cauterizing for torture.  
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven. 
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The torture that is treated with cautery is not except for species that occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases. 
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cautery for species that occurs from dryness and nerve spasm. 
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with rue, purges and gargles, and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the weak person in three places: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little below its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips. 
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery opposite the weak part. 
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not happen except in the part which appears healthy. 
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of the cautery is that you cauterize with the cautery itself directly at the upper end of the ear under the horn of the head a little; and again at another time; the length of which should be according to the length of the thumb.  
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned. 
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, whose form has been mentioned; however it is not thinner by a little, as you see; and it must be that the knife in it has a superfluous thickness a little. 
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the places with what precedes until they are healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.  
Caput VIII.	Chapter Eight. 
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes old, and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication does not work, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over all the horn of his head, and one cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and one cautery on the back of the head, according to what precedes; and let the method of cautery be according to what precedes. 
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also, cauterize with a cautery over the mouth of the stomach; and this is the last resort.  
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat it with what precedes. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	On the method of cauterizing in oblivion. 
Caput IX.	Chapter Nine.  
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that first, the sick person be given a large dose of hyssop in their drink, and pills to cleanse the brain. 
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the head of the sick person completely and place on the back of their head a plaster made of synaph, as described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times.  
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For indeed this is the method of cautery, and do that in the same order as I said there. 
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	Therefore if it heals by that, it is good. 
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which are descending from the top of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and put a finger's breadth between each cautery. 
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then take care of the cautery as with the one that preceded it. 
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you wish an addition, and he is weak enough to tolerate it, then make for him a cautery in the middle. 
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	But if you wish an addition, then cauterize it above the two horns. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then take care of it until it heals, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form that has been given. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	On the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening. 
Caput X.	Chapter Ten. 
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed in the purification of the head with lye and with what we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and a cautery on each horn of the head, and a cautery on the back of it, and three on the vertebrae of the neck. 
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you are lacking in the illness softening of the body with those and he is weak enough to tolerate it, and the illness is strong; then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cautery, until it burns out most of its skin, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then take care of it until it heals; and thus let the cautery be olive-shaped.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	On the method of cautery in epilepsy. 
Caput XI.	Chapter Eleven. 
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic person is not cauterized unless his epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore it is necessary that you cleanse his brain first with vinegar, and with the remaining treatment which we said in the division: when the patient is large, or he can tolerate the reception of medicines. 
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing chews are administered for the brain, before that for many days with improvement of foods. 
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner; and with another cautery on the back of his head, and with a cautery over every horn of his own head. 
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	But if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I said in those having paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck, and vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive-oil according to the manner which preceded. 
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	But if the patient is a child, then place a subtle cautery, according to this manner.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing in melancholy. 
Caput XII.	Chapter Twelve.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we said in those having paralysis. 
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity inclined toward melancholy and the body of the sick person is damp, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a decent headband from linen, like a circle. 
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head; and let the patient sitting straight be held on all sides.  
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present a liniment. 
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is more fitting from old butter. 
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over fire with a tempered heat measurement which the finger can tolerate when inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate it in the middle of its head in a circle, and leave it until it becomes cold. 
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do that to the weak one once a week, with the rest of its good regimen, until it is healed. 
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures in it, except for what you hold with the cautery: let there be a smell. 
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with quality. 
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then put a swab soaked in butter or chicken fat on top of it. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	On the way of cauterizing in descending water to the eye. 
Caput XIII.	Chapter Thirteen. 
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the beginning of water is declared to you in the eye through the signs that I mentioned in the division, then begin and drink the weak one, with what cleanses its head. 
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep it from all moisture, and make it sit in a bath, fasting for several days. 
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it above the two temples with two cauteries, if there is a beginning of descending water in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if there is a beginning of water in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cautery be long in the breadth of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood. 
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	For if you see anything coming from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with the wisdom that is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them off, and caution against the flow of blood.  
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries lastly produced. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	On the way of cauterizing in old tears.  
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV. 
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When tears from the eyes are old, persistent, and are upon the veins and arteries which are on the outer part of the head openly, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery as I have described in the beginning for descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones. 
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if it does not yield with addition, then cauterize it on every side cautiously near the eye, above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	Concerning the way of cauterizing for a foul smell of the nose.  
Caput XV.	Chapter XV. 
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not succeed, then hurry and give in a drink three nights a decoction of lentils: then shave its head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive-wood cautery.  
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a small clove-wood cautery, two cauteries above the two eyebrows a little under the hairs. 
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And be careful of the artery so that you do not strike it.  
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the shape of a clove-wood cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	Concerning the way of cauterizing for softening of an eyelid.  
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI. 
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When an eyelid of the eye softens from illness or humidity, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this moon-shaped cautery.  
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every side, and they will be lengthened from the two temples: and let the length of the whole cautery be according to the lengths of the eyebrow: and do not end your hand with the cautery, rather according to the amount that the third eyelid is burnt.  
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of a cautery according to this method of lunar cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the way of cauterizing an eyelid when hairs turn inwards and sting the eye.  
Caput XVII.	Chapter Seventeen. 
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	A cautery is of two types: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with a burning medicine. 
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	However, in a cautery with fire, advise the patient beforehand to let go of their hairs, if they are among those who remove them, until they grow long and equal. 
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if they sting him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a strip so that they do not move until they are born. 
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are therefore born and equal, then place the patient's head in your lap; then mark over the eyelid of their eyes with a cautery stick, a mark that is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs. 
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a swab dipped in albumin or psyllium mucilage over the eye.  
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply the cautery with fire, which has this form. 
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape that you marked gradually in many passes until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned properly.  
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contract and the hairs rise at the puncture of the eye. 
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore raise your hand then and let him go for three days.  
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place a swab with butter on it until the scab is eradicated. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment until he heals.  
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hair should return after an hour, and the eyelid becomes softened, then repeat the cautery on that place as you did first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	But if the hairs are below: then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place; and equalize it so that the hairs do not prick the eye. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the way of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.  
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII. 
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as if you instruct the sick person to let go of the hairs until they are prolonged and equalized.  
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from paper or cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf. 
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap, and from quicklime not soaked one ounce each or thereabouts; then grind them together with good friction, and do it quickly so that it does not cool down. 
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then from the pan put it upon the paper which you made like the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it upon the eyelid of one or both eyes. 
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a cloth soaked in albuminous matter; and let the head of the sick person be in your lap.  
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger upon the medicine, and press it for a short time. 
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you will move it whenever the sick person feels the bite of the medicine; because he finds its bite like fire. 
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	Therefore while this continues that he finds the bite, then let go of the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then if you see the eyelid rise as it rises in contraction with fire or with incision, it is good; and if not, then repeat upon it from the medicine upon the place where the medicine does not imprint and does not stain until your operation equals and the eye contracts.  
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place upon it a cloth with butter until the skin of the burn is removed. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with diaphinicon ointment or another until it heals. 
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during surgery to keep the last precaution so that something from the medicine does not fall into the eye. 
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if the eyelid softens after a few days and something from the hairs fights into the eye, then repeat the medicine upon that place which softens from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of a myrtle leaf. 
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and equality. 
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore let your consideration be according to that, and the way of straightness is not hidden from him who has a desire for this art. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter Nineteen. 
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, as we said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary for you to cauterize it according to this method. 
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the sick person to place his head on your lap, and let a minister hold his head between his hands so that it does not move nor shake with his head. 
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a cotton swab infused in egg white or in psyllium mucilage upon his eye; then with fire a cautery, the shape of which is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's feather quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it upward then try this way. 
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	But truly this concave shape is better for your purpose. 
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then press the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open then open it and extract its pus. 
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place upon it the cautery which has been ignited very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	Hold your hand with it for a short time near the cautery by the eye, toward the side of the nose, so that your hand does not wander, or the weak one is agitated; and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it. 
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	So if you reach at the beginning of your cautery up to the mouth, it will be well. 
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if necessary with it; and let it go for three days. 
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put a poultice with butter, and care for it with a drying ointment until it heals.  
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	And if forty days pass it and it does not heal: then put an acute corrosive medicine on it until the mouth is uncovered; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter. 
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another way of cautery for fistula, which some first said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct it to the place of the fistula and find it; then put a thin cautery into the fissure, that is, a thin cannula, whose form is this. 
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of a drachma of melted lead and hold your hand with the cannula in good retention, and do not move the weak one at all so that the molten lead does not run or reach its eye. 
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary to put a poultice soaked in albumin, or in water on the eye of the weak one.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it with a wonderful healing. 
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed with what we said from cautery, and care, it is good. 
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nasal foramen and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose according to what will come in its own place. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	On the way of cauterizing in lip fissures.

Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Very often fissures occur in the lip which are called pili, and especially in the lips of children. 
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore when you treat these fissures, as we said in the division of diseases, and treatment is ineffective, then apply a small knife cautery fire in this manner.  
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its concavity be according to the subtlety of the knife. 
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then immediately place the ignited cautery upon the fissures themselves until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with cerate until it heals. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula of the mouth.  
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI. 
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum or in the palate or in the roots of teeth, then it makes pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs from it, and a fistula forms: then treat it, and if treatment is ineffective, you must apply a cautery fire according to the size that fits into the fistula. 
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the ignited iron into the fistula opening and hold your hand steady until the ignited iron reaches its depth and end; do this once or twice. 
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterwards as we said about treatment until it is healed.  
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	Therefore if the discharge of blood is cut off and it heals, it will be good. 
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to open the area and remove the corrupt bone according to what comes in its chapter. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the gums and softened teeth.  
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.

When the gum softens because of moisture and teeth loosen, and you treat it with medication, and treatment is ineffective; then place the head of the infirm person in your lap. 
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then a cautery by fire, of which the shape will come after this, so that you place the Cannula upon the tooth: and introduce into it the ignited Cautery quickly: and hold your hand for a short time, until the weak one feels the heat of the fire has now reached the root of the tooth. 
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	Then raise your hand: then repeat the Cautery several times, according as you wish. 
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the weak one fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out. 
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth loosened is made firm, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Concerning the way of cauterizing in toothache. 
Caput XXIII.	Chapter Twenty-Three.  
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is because of coldness, or there is cold in it itself, or a worm, and healing does not come with medicine: then the Cautery is in itself according to two ways: either a Cautery with butter; or a Cautery with fire. 
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	But the Cautery of it with butter is, that you take vaccinum butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a brazier. 
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cotton swab, and wrap it upon the extremity of the tentacle.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in the boiled butter: and place it upon the aching tooth quickly, and hold it until it becomes cold: then repeat it several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.  
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse wool, or cotton in cold butter, and place it upon the aching tooth: and put ignited iron upon it, until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth. 
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But the cauterization of it with fire is, that you direct to an air cannula, or an iron cannula.  
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the weak one. 
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then a cautery by fire, whose shape will come, and place it upon that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery becomes cold. 
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do that several times, for the pain will be removed, either on the same day or another day. 
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary in the impression of that cautery, that the weak person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for an hour; then he spits it out.  
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery. 
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever extremity you wish according to what is possible; and this is the form of the cannula.

When hernias are from phlegm, and from cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and you wish for their quick digestion; then a concave cautery by fire, whose form is this. 
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that the smoke may exit at the cautery from one extremity; and place it ignited upon the hernia once, and a second time, if needed by it, until it reaches the depth of the hernia. 
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	Which if the hernia is small; then place the cautery according to the amount of the hernia.  
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it cotton infused in butter until what the fire burned is removed.

When humors overcome the canals of the lungs, and especially when it is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the weak person be first evacuated with dissolving medicines. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it at night at the root of the throat in a depressed place; and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor into the skin, except a little bit of it. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck in the last vertebra, ending it; and let the cautery be sharp according to the previous way.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the way of cauterizing in illnesses of the lung and cough. 
Caput XXVI.	Chapter Twenty-Six. 
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When the cough and lung ailment are from cold humors, and the weak person does not have a fever, nor phthisis, and the ailment is old: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the collarbone in depressed, gentle, empty places. 
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be cannula-shaped according to the form that preceded.  
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, which is called a Punctum, whose shape preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to almost others.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with what preceded until he is healed. 
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches according to this form.  
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore the cauterization is relieved when you do it with that juice and three cauteries together. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the way of cauterizing in a twitching, in dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter Twenty-Seven. 
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated because of humors, and it is not fixed within an hour of its return from its dislocation until it becomes accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a slight movement which happens as we have already testified: then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the weak person is laid on his back, or on his sound side. 
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin which is inside the scrotum upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint dislocates inwards. 
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then, having a burning cautery, apply two true points.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose shape is this. 
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the figure of the cautery will come with four cauteries.  
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cautery is done with a cautery having three points, so that the figure of the cautery then becomes six points: and the points are tested according to subtlety.  
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the shape of a cautery having three points. 
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one more is added in this way, so there are eight cauteries.  
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place bruised leeks with salt on the cautery. 
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the weak person adhere to tranquility so that the limb does not move for a while until it is strengthened.  
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it yourself above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or by puncturing with many cauteries.  
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened and moisture is removed: and the weak person is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.  
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and much moisture happen in the stomach until they draw it away from its own complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied to it, and there are frequent modes of treatment, and it does not help: then it is necessary for the weak person to be laid on his back, and to extend his legs and arms. 
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, the cautery under the pectoral spoon the size of one finger with a clavicle cautery, and two cauteries below on both sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.  
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between each so they do not join together when they form pus. 
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin. 
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this cautery is made be one according to the shape of a circle according to this form. 
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it for he who is frightened by this cautery: and it is that you make a sign upon the stomach a prick according to the quantity which you wish with an encaustic; then cauterize it itself with a point cautery; then care for it with the care which preceded until it is healed.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On the way of cauterizing a cold epar. 
Caput XXIX.	Chapter Twenty-Nine. 
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When it happens in the epar that pain arises from coldness and humidity, or from thick windiness, until superfluous egresses from its natural complexion, and the infirm is cured with that which we have said, and does not make progress in it: then it is necessary that the infirm lies on his back upon his neck, and makes three cauteries with an encaustic according to this figure, and the same quantity upon the epar below the hypochondria where the elbow of a man reaches; and let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand hard with the cautery. 
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of that which is burned from the thickness of the skin be the quantity of half of it not added to; and let the infirm stand upon his own feet.  
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him lie down who has already extended his legs and raised his arms. 
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of a cautery. 
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is indeed possible for you, to cauterize with this cautery using a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art. 
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And beware that you do not proceed too far in cauterization, and the thickness of all the skin is hardened, wherefore the whole body is hardened, and it reaches to the intestines: for the skin there is delicate, therefore know this. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the Method of Cauterizing Liver Abscesses.  
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX. 
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens that you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, a weak pain and gravity without sharpness invade; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with the pain there is vehement sharpness; and you see now that the treatment has wearied its physicians. 
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore it is necessary that the weak person lie down on his neck.  
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark the location of the abscess with a hot iron; then ignite the cautery which resembles a ray. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with this cautery one time, until the whole skin is burned and reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with treatment for ulcers, until it heals.  
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary that this species of cautery be used, except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged; and through whose hands these illnesses run frequently with experiment: then let him dare to perform this kind of operation.  
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But truly I consider it better to leave it alone.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the Method of Cauterizing in Pleuresy. 
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery with the roots of aristolochia should be applied to cold pleuresy in this way. 
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	Take a single long root from the dried roots of aristolochia, which is found among them and is as thick as a finger. 
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil and set it alight with fire. 
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with a single cautery between the extension of the collarbone and the neck, and with two small cauteries under the jawbone on slight slopes towards the part that is below the beard. 
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also between the fifth and sixth ribs on slight slopes towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. 
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the back: one between the two shoulder blades; and two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades. 
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to press your hand with the cautery, rather let it be held openly on the skin smelling. 
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a spoke; they ignite it and insert it between the ribs until they reach the abscess with it, and pus flows out; as we said in the case of a liver abscess. 
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But there is danger in this perforation with a cautery because either the weak person dies immediately or a fistula forms in the place, which has no cure.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter Thirty-Two. 
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat spleen disease as we said in the treatment in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not work, then a cautery is used according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of them is to make three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver cauteries, whose figure precedes this one. 
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every cautery a quantity of the thickness of a finger, or more or less. 
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the manner of the cautery, which we said in the cautery of the liver, be equally so. 
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie on his back. 
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: to have the cautery with two points of fire, as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and raise the skin which is in the direction of the spleen, where the left elbow of the patient reaches; and let your elevation be such that you raise the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries may fall according to the length of the body.  
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert the two burning points deeply until you penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; thus there will be four cauteries. 
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish, cauterize with another cautery having three points. 
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care that the cautery after you have let it discharge pus for many days; for it is more convergent than any other which has preceded from healing. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the Method of Cauterizing in Dropsy. 
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter Thirty-Three.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	A cautery does not fall in dropsy, except on the legs properly. 
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a dropsy patient with the methods of treatment which we said in the division, and the treatment does not converge, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one in the direction of the chest, and another in the direction of the stomach; and let the quantity of the depth of the cautery be near the thickness of the skin. 
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.  
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not withdraw the weak from treatment after cautery with him, for it is necessary that two intentions be joined to him, and healing will hasten to him with the help of God. 
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be a claw, as its shape preceded; and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-shaped, according to its preceding form. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing feet and legs. 
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV. 
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they swell up with dropsy and are filled with clear water, it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocrati region, which is between the auricular and annular regions; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand and do not rub it at all. 
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the clear water will redden, and the cautery should be of this form. 
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on both legs, and let the cautery be made with the sharp end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below it, around the middle of the leg; and make two cauteries on each thigh. Leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time so that some water reddens from it; then treat it with the rest that we have said.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterizing in ventral hernia. 
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a ventral hernia from cold and humidity, until the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines weaken, and it is treated with methods of treatment and does not heal; and you see the weak patient tolerating cautery of abundant power, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as previously mentioned in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel with a claw-shaped small cautery; and a large cautery above the groin above the pubic bone, or two cauteries. 
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moistures, and a weak patient enduring it, then cauterize it with a cautery over the comb, and with a cautery over the whole groin; and perhaps you will add two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one. 
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a beneficial treatment, whose advantage does not stray. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing hemorrhoids. 
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six. 
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted humidities, and they are cured with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not take effect: then cauterize with three cauteries over the lower spinal bone of the back under the almeidati a little triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel as if with two fingers. 
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled and his food is not digested, and you see his face swelling, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded; and with a cautery over his liver, and another over his spleen, with a clauile cautery: and let the cautery be open for some time; then treat him until he is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing atheromas after their excision.  
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter Thirty-Seven. 
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise atheromas, then heat a cautery that resembles a rod. 
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the heated one into the excised atheroma; and guide your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once, or twice. 
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many atheromas, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have described.  
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what is beneficial for them from ointments, until they are healed. 
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the ligature, it is most effective for healing. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the Method of Cauterizing a Fistula in Ano. 
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII. 
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not submit to incision and the work which we have described in its place, and is terrified of it, perhaps he may be healed with a cautery. 
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	Therefore, when it happens to someone that a fistula exists, and it is longstanding, pus flows from it, and corrupt humors.  
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is therefore more fitting that you should examine it with a subtle probe. 
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then ascertain the depth of it with the probe. 
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then ignite a cautery, which is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the ignited [cautery] into the fistula itself and mark the quantity in which it entered.  
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery upon it until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity of your need. 
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And be careful of burning a nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then be careful of all these places. 
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it heals.  
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed, and materials are cut away from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then know that it has now been completely healed.  
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupt opening in its depth, or as if it were one of those [fistulas], the recollection of which will come in its place. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys.  
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX. 
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or thick windiness and weakens because of it a person's body, then it is necessary to cauterize him above the almethenem above the kidneys themselves with a cautery over all the kidney with a clauili cautery, of which remembrance precedes. 
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we should cauterize him a second time on the very almeidatu itself. 
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more ultimate in benefit. 
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Concerning the way of cauterizing the bladder. 
Caput XL.	Chapter XL. 
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and humidity so that the sick person does not retain urine, then cauterize him in the lower part of the penis above the bladder where pubic hairs begin, with a cautery from the right side of the penis and another from the left: and let the length of that cauterization be according to the quantity of a knuckle; and cauterize him with a lower back cautery, or two cauteries if necessary: and it should be as preceded by a clauile cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Concerning the way of cauterizing the matrix. 
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI. 
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and humidity occur in the matrix and it is forbidden by it from impregnation, and its menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs to her upon their arrival, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a lower back cautery or two cauteries: and let the cautery be clauile. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Concerning the way of cauterizing the ankle in dislocation. 
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII. 
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous humidities pour down to the ankle joint and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg is prolonged over the other when they are compared to each other, and a void place is found in it.  
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary that you apply the weak cautery above the Anchae pixid in a circle similar to the cautery itself. After you mark with encausto in a circle around the pixid, as it rotates; so that the pixid itself falls in the middle of the circle. 
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the shape that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach. 
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	But if this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of all the skin. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterizing in sciatica. 
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII. 
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the Anchae pixid, and the cause of it is cold and humidity; and the sick person is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not work, and it becomes chronic; then it is necessary to dissolve the sick person from thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and the like. 
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him. 
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautery in this is according to two methods: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire. 
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many methods. 
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you cauterize above the Anchae pixid itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form. 
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make their depth good, or bad.  
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between each cautery be the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be an olive one. 
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, cautery is done in the middle above the head of the Anchae itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries. 
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose shape precedes in the cauterization of a wide dislocation, make it one: so that it is a circle containing the whole dislocation. 
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of all the skin. 
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain adheres to the wide area itself and does not extend as far as the hip and leg. 
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends as far as the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place to which the sufferer points there, in which there is pain, and your cautery above the calf four fingers toward the hairy side a little: and let the cautery be a knife-shaped one. 
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin. 
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if the sufferer points out that the pain extends as far as near the toes, then cauterize it there where he points with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if he needs it so. 
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he points out the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-shaped cautery. 
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterizations that you do not finish with the cautery so as to burn a nerve or a large artery, and thereby bring upon the sufferer evil harm or contraction through it. 
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have indeed already seen one and another, from those who cauterized above the calf, and finished in the cautery, and the leg swelled up until a tumor reached the foot, and it was perforated all through and corrupted altogether: then there followed rupture of the belly, and death after that. 
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	But if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize both according to this method. 
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men have said in the cauterization of a wide area, of which this is the method of cautery. 
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a speculum of iron, its diameter half a palm; and let it have at its opening according to the thickness of a fingertip, or a little less: and within that speculum let there be a third speculum. 
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between all the specula be by the amount of a thumb knot; and let the specula be open from two sides; and let their height be as a thumb knot, or two thumb knots; and make for them a handle of iron suitably fitted to the specula. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then heat it in fire until it glows and projects sparks; then place it on a pitch plaster, the patient lying on their side with the healthy side down. 
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cauteries in one go. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let them go for three days. 
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply a plaster with butter; and leave the wound open for many days. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, with this type of cautery, O son, we have rarely used it, because of the terror of its appearance; and therefore, because we have found few who would endure it. 
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless, it is among the good cauteries for him who suffers it, and finds its place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	A cautery however, with healing medicines is such that you make two specula having a perforated handle into which descends the bar of its door from bronze, or iron, the length of a finger; whose height should be two thumb knots, or approximately so. 
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space that is between each one be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above; and let that which contains them to each other, according to this form.  
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on a pitch plaster, the patient lying on their healthy side. 
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly upon the broad pestle. 
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles water that has been heated slightly with fire and hold it for the space of an hour: let the sick person endure its bite and its burning, for he will find the bite like fire until the bite is quieted. 
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument and wash away the warm water from the whole pestle with fresh water; then let it sit for three days. 
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter upon it until the blackness of the burn is removed; and let it sit for several days, and pus will flow from it. 
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the final step in healing. 
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.  
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	But if the pain extends as far as the hip or leg: make for him a bath that contains water, according to what you did with the pestle equally. 
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.  
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and quicklime, each a part equal to the other; grind them both, and put them in a new jar, whose lower part has one small hole according to the quantity that the radius itself will enter: and place under the bottom of the jar another glazed jar: and pour over the alkali and lime fresh water, so that it submerges each by a finger; then press them with your hand with good compression: and let the jar sit until sharp water descends into the lower part of the glazed jar. 
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water and pour it over other lime; and strain until it is renewed. 
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterizing of other members. 
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it effects the operation of fire itself.  
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among medicines are those with which they cauterize wounds, such as alum, and gum arabic, and lime mixed with soap, so that both are blended together. 
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And indeed Galen related a cure of some ancient man, by which he was healed of pain in the neck and sciatic vein; and he greatly praised it. 
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not need any other cure, and that he was healed by a single draught, until he related that perhaps he had gone into a bath and came out of it already well. 
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from green rue; and if green is not found, let the dry one be taken, fresh; and it is rubbed much with a little fat, and placed on the wound where there is pain, or leg, or thigh; and it is tied on and left for three hours, or for as long as the sick person feels the heat subside.  
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then let him enter a bath. 
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	Therefore, when his body becomes warm, put him on a couch.  
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain subsides and he is healed. 
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no one ought to use a cautery with these medicines except after evacuation of the body.  
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who also said this, that goat dung, when it is cauterized with it, causes it to contract; and a cautery is made in this way. 
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed on the deep spot which is between the big toe and the next one, and which is closer to the ankle.  
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and inflame it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. 
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that. 
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore do not cease to do this until the feeling reaches the middle of the leg and the pain subsides. 
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called vaccinum cautery. 
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On the Cauterization of Back Pain. 
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44. 
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and humid matter; and cautery indeed does not apply except in this single species, which is caused by the infusion of cold matter. 
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the evacuation of the sick person with fetid pills and the like, three lines should be made on the back where there is pain, according to the width of the almeidate itself; after which five cauteries or more are marked with an encausto in each line, according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the sick person's strength; and cauterization should be done with a point cautery. 
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a middle-sized clauile cautery, according to this form. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the Method of Cauterizing in the Onset of Kyphosis.  
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45. 
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	Very often this disease occurs in young children. 
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its onset in boys is: that a constriction occurs upon him in breathing near the elevation and motion; and the youth in the last vertebra of the back and its nodes, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see this, and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form. 
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery encompass all sides of the vertebra equally; and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a point cautery two or three lines; and let the points be close to one another.  
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place until it heals with what we have said. 
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, that you do not apply a cautery to a hump which arises from spasm of a nerve. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing gout and pains in the joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI. 
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When pains in the joints are from cold humors which flow to any member of the body, then when pains happen in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call that gout specifically. 
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of healing, and the pains are not removed, then a cautery removes them. 
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is to cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the feet with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-wood. 
Cuius haec est forma.	Its form is this.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if it seems best to you to prick upon the face of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. 
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pains ascend as far as the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize him upon the whole knee with three or four cauteries on every side, with the same olive-wood cautery. 
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if more of these cauteries are necessary for you, then cauterize him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said from the cautery in its chapter. 
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	But if the pains are only in the hands, then make punctures around the wrists as two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if any pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them upon every knuckle, and upon the comb of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both on every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not discharge the weak from good regimen, from reception of medicines. 
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good regimen is done, and phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with the help of God by this cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the way of cauterizing in ruptures. 
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII. 
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine descends, or the omentum to the testicle, and it is beginning nearby: then it is necessary that you order the sick person to abstain from food on his day. 
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that feces may descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands upon his back; and order him to hold his breath until it comes out, or the omentum, or the intestine appears. 
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cautery under the rupture upon the bone of the hip, with a sign whose end is like half a circle towards the upper part of the body. 
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the fire to the cautery, which has this shape, until it becomes white and projects sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or omentum to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let a servant place his hand upon the spot so that the intestine does not come out; and you have now opened between the sick man's thighs, and placed a cushion beneath him, and a servant above his thighs, and another above his chest who holds his hands. 
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery upon the mark itself, with your hand holding the cautery upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it there until you reach the bone with it; or repeat it with another cautery if you have not reached the bone with the first one.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and thereby cause great harm or death to the patient. 
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not achieve an opening with the cauterization, your operation is of no effect. 
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be delicate, according to their size. 
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with other ointments until it is healed. 
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.  
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you provide him with nourishment for the length of his healing time, which soothes his stomach so that the intestines do not prolapse during straining and defecation.  
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then apply a well-made bandage and let him wear it for another forty days. 
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should abstain from labor, overeating and drinking, and loud voices. 
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he follows this regimen, he will thus be healed completely.  
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the treatment of ruptures with an incision in its own chapter. 
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	But when ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen and are beginning, and you wish them not to increase, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery according to its size; and let that which is cauterized be about one-third of it. 
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it as we have said, and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some first-mentioners have already said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form. 
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with a cautery, and a line is placed which is across its width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a hooked cautery. 
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But a cautery is first easier and better. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing for pains due to a fall or a blow. 
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter Forty-Eight. 
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or a blow and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help it, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a point cautery. 
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be of every member according to its size and its suitability and its weakness and its power and the location of the twist and the pain from it. 
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	Therefore if it is healed by the first cautery, it is well. 
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat the cautery upon it. 
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For it is customary for these pains to transfer from one limb to the one next to it.  
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary that you pursue them with a cautery until the weak one is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing for leprosy. 
Caput XLIX.	Chapter Forty-Nine. 
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Lepers sometimes are greatly helped by cautery.  
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy which comes from putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; therefore when you wish to cauterize it consider.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If then leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it does not descend, nor stand still: and you are afraid for the sick person, that corruption may spread over his whole complexion: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head known, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck. 
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And lastly put your hand with the cautery for a short time on it until it makes a small impression, and the crusts separate from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors from it may be relieved; and also cauterize with the cautery the spleen itself according to what was said before. 
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if leprosy is already spread over the sick person and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries which we said on the head, and with a cautery on the extremity of the nose, and two cauteries on the two maxillas, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the buttocks at the root of the tail and one above it, on the very buttock itself: and two on the ankles: namely, one on each ankle, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the tendernesses of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet: and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and on the knuckles of his hands. 
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And be careful for yourself from the nerves which are above the last part of the heel so that you do not burn them. 
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes one should cauterize with a cautery on the bone of the chest, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.  
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add cautery, the more benefit there is, and the more healing. 
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that a sick person does not find pain in cauterization, as healthy people do; because his body is already stunned. 
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and suitability according to the limbs and joints; according to what preceded from the kinds of instruments. 
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cautery with herb flour and honey, and other care, until it heals. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the manner of cauterizing in a stupor.
Caput L.	Chapter L. 
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a limb is in a stupor and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters and does not heal, then cauterize the stupefied limb with cauteries, according to what its size or smallness deserves. 
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery penetrate into the thickness of the skin a little. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals. 
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for a certain stupor that happens to the hand and foot, at the exits of the nerves which move them.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let no one presume on that unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the body.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the manner of cauterizing in Albaras. 
Caput LI.	Chapter LI. 
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras grows old and nothing from medical arts takes effect in it; then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the amount of the skin's thickness until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with herb flour and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and dove blood, and swallow blood; let there be a portion from each: mix all these things and spread them on cloth and apply to the place until it heals. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the Method of Cauterizing Cancer. 
Caput LII.	Chapter Fifty-Two. 
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery all around its circumference, as it revolves. 
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men have said, however, that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.  
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	However, that does not seem right to me, because I fear that it might ulcerate, and I have already seen that happen many times. 
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is more correct to cauterize it in its circumference with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the Method of Cauterizing an Adubelate.  
Caput LIII.	Chapter Fifty-Three. 
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an adubelate and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excessive moisture causing it or because of the weakness of age, when he is old and with little blood, or because of the time and you wish to hasten the maturation of the adubelate, then cauterize around its circumference with many small cauteries puncturing. 
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let it alone. 
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten in maturation.  
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then use a hot cautery which has this shape. 
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the adubelate until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be weaker than the one that follows so that the flow is relieved. 
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the Method of Cauterizing an Eating Sore. 
Caput LIIII.	Chapter Fifty-Four.  
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosive is nothing but a corruption in a limb that moves about and eats it up; just as fire consumes dry wood. 
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	Therefore, if you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then use many hot cauteries, small and large, according to what suits the place where the corrosive is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate all corruption and nothing at all remains within. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let it alone for three days, and put upon the cauterized places sulfur pounded with oil until all the scabs and all corruption are eradicated. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with ointments that produce flesh. 
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	Therefore if you see that after three days healthy flesh is born in which there is no corruption, it is good. 
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not, then repeat the cautery upon that which remains from the corrupt places. 
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And a corrosive medicine is sometimes applied with a sharp medicine. 
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it itself arises in the place of the cautery.  
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is of quicker healing, and I indeed already said cauterization of it with a sharp medicine in the division; therefore take it there when it is needed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing warts and moles. 
Caput LV.	Chapter Fifty-Five.  
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Very often this illness occurs in the lower parts of the feet and it is a thick, filtered thing which injures the foot. 
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed cautery on them is according to two methods: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water. 
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	But as for cautery with fire, it should be a concave cautery like a vulture's feather made of iron according to the size which contains the wart on every side and have subtle edges. 
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it ignited upon the wart.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then revolve the hand with the cautery around the wart until the cautery reaches the depth of the wart; and let it alone for three days until it begins to emit pus. 
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster it with mullein leaves crushed with salt and let the plaster remain upon it at night. 
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It itself will be eradicated from its roots. 
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals. 
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they are not inverted, and they often happen on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet; then apply a cautery to them with hot water: and it is necessary that you take a cannula from bronze, or iron, or from a vulture quill: and place it upon a coal, or an althelul. 
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula; hold your hand and revolve it with compression of your hand for a little while so that the edge of the cannula is imprinted in the root of the coal, and the hot water finds a way to the depths, to the root of the coal: and let the patient wait for a short time over the bite of the hot water for an hour. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then dismiss him, for the coal will be eradicated with its roots. 
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this to them one by one until you come upon all that are from them in the body.  
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are eradicated with what generates flesh from ointments. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in tremors.  
Caput LVI.	Chapter Fifty-Six. 
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone that a tremor occurs from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or another: then it is necessary for you to cauterize him with four cauteries, or five upon the dorsal vertebrae, and between every vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and upon his stomach a cautery. 
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For the tremor subsides with an olive-oil cautery, and hastens the healing of the cold illness. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	Concerning the method of cauterizing according to Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter Fifty-Seven. 
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul albathir are expelled in the body, that is, pustules, which are made from corrupted thick materials. 
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, it is necessary first that when they appear, they be cauterized over the entire head of the pustules with a delicate cautery made of myrtle wood, whose end has been ignited with fire. 
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with a long aristolochia root. 
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. 
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the very beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not grow larger: and the excess is broken down making them, and they are healed from them. 
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Very often it happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut at a wound, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or the cautery of a limb, and similar things to these; and it becomes difficult to stop it.  
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore when this happens to someone then hurry with your hand to the orifice of the artery and place your index finger upon it; and press it very much until the blood is confined beneath your finger and nothing comes out from it.  
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place a small olive-wood cautery into the fire, and many more of a large size; and blow upon them until they become very ignited.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one from them, either a small or large one according to the wound and the place where the artery has been severed, and apply the cautery upon it; after which you quickly remove your finger and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.  
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled when you raise your finger from the orifice of the artery and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those that are prepared in the fire. 
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease to do this with one after the other until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware that you do not burn the nerve which is there, and other harm befall the sick person. 
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery it is not possible to cut it off; especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods. 
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said. 
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted. 
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off. 
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature thread. 
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicines of a nature to cut off blood are placed upon it, and it is bound with a decent constricting bandage. 
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But whoever performs its cutting off with a ligature, and constriction with cloth, or application of burning things, and similar methods, does not heal it completely except rarely. 
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if it should happen to someone and there is no doctor or medicine present, then let him begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and constricting it tightly until the blood is blocked from above the wound and over the artery. 
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, but water of a very cold temperature should constantly be poured over it until the blood freezes and thickens, and is cut off. 
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	Meanwhile he should consider what he needs from a cautery or medicine.  
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	End of the First Part. 
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	The Second Part of the Surgical Book of Albucasis. 
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds and Similar Things. 
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the First Chapter that every illness for which it is appropriate to use fire with a cautery and burning medicine, its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cauteries. 
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed chapters there from the head to the foot. 
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter the same way so that it may be relieved for the one seeking his question. 
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, oh sons, that in this chapter there is from the terror that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.  
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And on account of that it is necessary that there be more caution in this one, because in the operation which is in this chapter, very often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of an exit wound, or healing of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and those similar: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death falls upon many of them. 
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that which is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes there fall upon you in this art ways of men with ways of illnesses. 
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is he who becomes angry with his illness, and death is easy for him on account of the vehemence which he finds from his illness and the length of its malice.  
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness there is fear which signifies death. 
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from them is he who gives his lyre player and enriches you with it, hoping for healing, and his illness is harmful. 
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not necessary that you consent to him who comes to you from them, whose way is such. 
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vehement than your greed and your avarice.  
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from that, except after certain knowledge, which verifies at you that to which praiseworthy succession arrives. 
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the healing of all your sick a prognosis and an indication concerning it to which conveniently belongs health.  
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that there is help for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise. 
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire in you his intellect, and not take away from you direction and inspiration: for that is in his hand. 
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed ordered this chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck down to the feet: so that you may be relieved of what you seek and need from it.  
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Concerning the treatment of water which gathers in the heads of children. 
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this infirmity often happens to boys at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the boy without gentleness. 
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I indeed have not seen this illness in anyone but boys; and to all whom I have seen from them, death has hastened: therefore it seemed to me to abandon the operation in it. 
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I indeed saw from them a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled every day until he could not sit upon himself because of the size of his head: and the humidity increased until he died. 
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this humidity indeed gathers either between the skin and the bone; or it gathers under the bone above the suture.  
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that case, if it is humidity between the skin and the bone, and it is a small abscess, then it is necessary for you to make a fissure in the middle of the head one fingerbreadth wide: and let the length of the fissure be as much as two knuckles until the humidity runs out. 
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a spatula. 
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the humidity is increased more and the abscess is larger, then make those two fissures according to this form.  
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the humidity is under the bone and the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side: and the water sinks when you press it with your hand to its inside, and it is not hidden from you; then it is necessary for you to make in the middle of the head three fissures according to this manner.  
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all the moisture. 
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the fissures with cloths and lint. 
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then embrocate it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day. 
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with tents and ointments. 
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not allow the head to be compressed evenly.  
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak with all dry food of little humidity, until the limb is strengthened and healed. 
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another manner of incision is, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess appears, and the collection of water. 
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is more at the back of the head, or at the top of the head, or on the right, or on the left. 
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore ascend with the incision where you see the abscess and the filling of water: and cleave it according as is possible for you. 
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you strike an artery, and there be a flow of blood, and the weak person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture. 
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of arteries which are behind the ears. 
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When it happens to someone that catarrh occurs at the eyes, or at the chest, and it becomes old, and treatment with medicines does not benefit it: then a more final remedy is in this case, incision of these two arteries. 
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore it is necessary when you wish to incise them, that the sick person shall shave his head.  
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries may appear. 
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the sick person compress his neck, with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulses. 
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are places which are depressed behind the ears: and it rarely conceals itself, unless in some people. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a cautery over each one; and incise each one with a scalpel on both sides, the incision reaching the mouth; and let it be done across the width of the head. 
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert a speculum beneath the artery and cut it above with an incision. 
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers. 
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood flows out in a pulsing stream, which rises to the insides with frequent leaps. 
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear a distance of three fingerbreadths. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with sealing wax and cut down to the bone.  
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which ought to be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you may emit from it more or less. 
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of this according to the quantity which appears to you from the weakness of the sick person and the fullness of his artery.  
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound. 
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains at the bone from the incision, then cut it so that a hot abscess may not occur: then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed. 
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples. 
Caput III.	Chapter III. 
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that he has an old headache or sharp catarrh because of acrimonious humors and heat in the temples, or an old soda, vehement, and similar things: and it is treated with the methods of medical treatment and it does not help, then we have found in these illnesses the extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them is that the sick person shaves the hairs which are in the temples and stretches towards the apparent artery in the temple. 
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it indeed shows itself to you from its pulse and rarely is it concealed except in a few people or vehement cold. 
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is concealed from you, then let the weak person bind their head with any cloth they have: then rub the place with a rough cloth. 
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or vaporize the place with warm water until it appears to you manifestly. 
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I had previously made. 
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then flay the skin with it easily until you reach the artery. 
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw a hook into it and draw it upwards until you draw it out of the skin and make it come out from all the tunics that are under it. 
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	But if the artery is slender: then enfold it with the extremity of the hook. 
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut a part from it according to the amount by which its extremities are lengthened and contracted so that bleeding does not occur. 
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not incised and if it is not cut off, the blood does not ascend thoroughly.  
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from the blood six ounces up to three. 
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if the artery is large: it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread: or with al-hodad cords so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the consolidation of the wound and bleeding occurs. 
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the excess which is between the two ligatures.  
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that in that hour or another hour. 
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone with a knife cautery until its extremities fall and it stands in place of the same work. 
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better operation unless the weak person has a fever or a hot complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because a cautery is one of those that help to finish humidities. 
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy. 
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with well-cooked lint: and let poultices be placed on top of it loosely made.  
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the loosening, it should be treated with dry medicines, which cause flesh to grow, and with dressings, until it is healed. 
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	And if meanwhile while you are working there should occur a flow of blood from an artery, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with wool; and bind your hand until the blood is severed.  
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	And if none of these things are present to you, then place your finger upon the place until the blood coagulates. 
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embrocate the place with water of violent cold, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound as is necessary. 
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because that which is lighter and easier for the extraction of an artery is, to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives; let the sharpness of the two knives be like a razor. 
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However they are of much less sharpness than two knives.  
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp like two knives, cold quickly follows to both; and they do not strike the flesh with speed.  
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore since there is a little thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly; with this therefore the work is better than all other work, and lighter, and easier.  
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space which is between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with sealing wax; and lay both ignited strongly, until they reach the mouth, and they strike the vein in two places: so that what is between its ends is lengthened.  
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not fully consolidated with this cautery. 
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.  
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of sharp, persistent courses of tears from the eyes. 
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are persistent and the course of them is from the veins which are upon the exterior skull; and no medicine treatment confers anything upon them with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person already reddening, and he feels in his forehead a walking motion, as there is a walking motion of ants; and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that his hairs are already corroded by corrosion; and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears; then the ancients used this operation in their treatment, and they called it treatment with a Sword. 
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is to be commanded that the patient shave the hairs on his forehead. 
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions in the forehead at equal distances according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of each incision be about two fingers; and let one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second a little distance beyond the length according to the movement of the tear ducts, and the third on the other side; and beware of cutting the arteries which are on both sides; and extend your hand from the continuation of the two mandibles, and let the space of the whole incision be the size of three joined fingers; and have a piece of sponge or many dry cloths ready with which to dry the blood. 
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a speculum with two pointed ends, of which the following form will be.  
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the temple side to the second incision; and with it flay all the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the flesh which is above the mouth. 
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision. 
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then withdraw this speculum and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a sharp curette, blunt on one side and not sharp on the other. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.  
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the sharp side of it toward the flesh joined with the skin, and the blunt side towards the mouth; and press it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut off with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, except that the incision be continued up to what appears from the skin. 
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when an equal quantity runs out of blood, squeeze out the places from the clots of congealed blood. 
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place a linen wick steeped in old wine upon all the fissures; and put poultices soaked in wine, oil or vinegar over them. 
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur. 
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the ligature, and administer much infusion with warm water. 
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with royal ointment, and other things with which wounds are healed: until it is healed. 
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	On the treatment of sharp tears and cataracts to the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	Chapter Five. 
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, sharp, and persistent catarrs occur to someone: and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their aspect already debilitated: and the eyelids ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and there is a sharp, hurting pain in the depth of the head, and consequent sneezing: then take from these accidents that those matters and catarrhs do not come except from many veins. 
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better cure in them is this.  
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you order the sick person to shave his forehead. 
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one fissure in the middle of the forehead, or another a little further by width, and begin with the fissure from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be up to the mouth: and extend your hand from the muscles of the temples, which are moved at mastication: until when the mouth is uncovered: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge. 
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with old thread, or with linen strips. 
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then constrict from above with lint: and soak the lint with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur. 
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen that, and you see that the hot abscess already diminishes: then it is necessary for you to cauterize the mouth until flesh begins to be born in it.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to be born: such as if you take two parts from wheat flour, and four parts from colophony: and prepare an adhesive plaster from them, and administer it until the birth of flesh in these wounds.  
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the treatment of that which falls into the ear. 
Caput VI.	Chapter Six. 
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar, and things similar to them; or some animal. 
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	Therefore, when a stone or a type of stone falls into the ear from those which are not added to and do not grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if then you see the stone, then distill something from violet oil or sesame oil into the ear.  
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then perform its extraction and make him sneeze with something that has been mashed up, and plug his nostrils at the time of the sneeze, after you place into the circumference of the ear wads from cloths or wool, and extend the ear upward. 
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Very often it comes out with this care.  
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not come out, then administer its extraction with forceps, that is, with subtle pincers: whose form is this. 
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out with the forceps, it is good. 
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a thin blind hook of few turns.  
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out through that, then make a cannula from bronze, and insert the end of the cannula into the ear canal far, and plug what is in the circumference of the cannula with softened wax with oil so that there is no way for air except through the cannula: then extract it with your strong suction. 
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Very often it comes out with what we have narrated.  
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not come out this way: then take a small amount from hellebore, or from birdlime, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught; and place it on the end of a probe after you have wrapped a well-placed wad upon it: then insert it into the ear canal with ease after you have dried the ear from moisture. 
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not go out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incise, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs. 
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the manner of incision is, that the phlebotomist should first make a small incision on the cephalic vein; and draw from him blood according to his strength. 
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near his fat in a depressed place; and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone; then remove it with what is possible for you from the instruments. 
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the incision quickly with care, until it heals.  
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	But if the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell; then perform its extraction. 
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not yield to your efforts for removal, then take a fine, slender spatula according to this form.  
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And apply it to cut off that type of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear until you have put many splinters into it; then extract them with hooks or a fine probe or suction as we have said, for its extraction is alleviated.  
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But as for the water which enters into the ear, it is necessary that the sick person should use sneezing when he first sits down; and he has already filled his ear with some old cooked oil; and he lies on that ear in which there is water. 
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through it, it is good. 
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones according to the length of a finger, thin and smooth, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the sick person insert one of them into the opening of his ear; and leap on one of his feet from that side, and strike it with another stone upon the one which is in the ear. 
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, he should not cease to do that with stone and stone until all the water comes out. 
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out so that you may take one from a crucible, or from a rush, and insert one of its ends into the ear; and you ignite the other end with fire until most of it is burned up. 
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat with another rush, and do that many times until all the water comes out; and extract it with a tube according to what was said in the stone. 
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	However, in the extraction of an animal entering into it, if it is of small body, such as a flea, and the like, take care of it as I said in the division. 
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses; then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks; and its matter is easier than all those that are held in the ear. 
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	However, in the extraction of a generated worm in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not work; then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun. 
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something from worms appears there, then extract it with gestures or with subtle hooks.  
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there, then take a tube, which has this shape, narrow below, wide above; and insert the subtle end into the ear according to the amount that the weak one can tolerate it; then suck with strong suction. 
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do that many times until all the worms come out.  
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you for the exit, then cauterize the circumference of the tube with wax, as I said in the stone. 
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	But if they do not come out with what we said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already experienced in the infection of worms; and you will find it in the treatise on distillations. 
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your effusion with which you pour oil and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. 
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it yourself from silver, or bronze, narrow below, in which there be a small hole, wide above. 
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it therefore be so that driving what is in the concavity of the cannula, be made decently from bronze.  
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a ray, and involve cotton in its extremity with decent involution; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever you wish from these medicines into the cannula; and let the cannula itself be in the ear; then introduce the ray with cotton above, and press it with your hand with temperate compression until the oil is driven into the concavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it within; and let that which is poured into the ear already be warmed a little with fire; and beware lest anything that is distilled into it be very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that. 
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the cure of an accidental Auricular Exudation. 
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants issue from the wombs of their mothers not perforated.  
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people that an exudation occurs in the auditory passage from a wound, or flesh born therein.  
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this exudation sometimes occurs in the depth of the ear hole, which does not follow sight; and sometimes it happens to the outer part of the hole a little, and follows it by sight. 
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which occurs in the depth of the ear, and which does not comprehend the view, is in many dispositions difficult healing. 
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows sight, it is necessary for you to place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look into it; then if you see an apparent exudation, open it with a subtle speculum, whose form is as follows: let its extremity be where there is a small breadth, of which a part be acute; and let the rest of the speculum be of two smooth sides, so that it does not injure the ear. 
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the growth is from the flesh born in the ear canal: then hold it with a fine hook, and cut into it with strong ease, until all the flesh is removed. 
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	But if the growth is deep in the ear: then take a fine, gentle ray, and heat it slightly with fire: then put it into the ear canal. 
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you perceive the growth with that which the weak find with gravity of hearing, endeavor its opening with ease: and beware, lest you wound the nerves of the ear. 
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a linen compress according to the quantity of the amplitude of the hole which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound. 
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take linen and infuse it in rose water, and sprinkle upon it powdered zedoary, and use it. 
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	But if you see the ear already to have become abscessed: then it is necessary that you remove the linen and allow it with another linen which you wrap in cerate made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides: then care for it until it heals.  
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if a flow of blood should occur: then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water and place them upon the ear: and use the remaining care which separates the flow of blood as mentioned in the treatise on distillations.  
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Concerning the Care of Althel's Eyelids. 
Caput VIII.	Chapter Eight. 
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These althel which occur on the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry. 
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with tweezers: or with a hook, and cut into them with a scalpel from their roots. 
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place upon the spots powdered zedoary. 
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood should flow from them, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery.  
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them, is better after incision. 
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For very often they return when something remains from their roots. 
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and they do not return. 
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the Treatment of Hailstones on the Eyelid. 
Caput IX.	Chapter Nine.  
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Very often there occurs in the eyelids something which is likened to a Hailstone in its firmness and hardness, and on account of that it is called a Hailstone: and it is an aggregation of thick humidity in the upper eyelid, and the lower eyelid. 
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore the operation on them is, that you consider then whether it is a Hailstone proceeding from it, which appears from the eyelid and moves to every part, and its matter is easy. 
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore make above it a fissure through its breadth.  
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every part with ease until it comes out. 
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.  
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if the cutting of it is not prepared for you except after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision a little, then that harms the weak one somewhat.  
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the fissure is large: then join it together with suture: and take care of it until it heals. 
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.  
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and makes it flesh. 
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the hailstone is sloping toward the inner parts of the ear toward its inner surface, then turn back the eyelid and suspend the hailstone with a hook; besides which you will need an incision and press it from every part.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	But if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, that does not harm anyone somewhat.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water and take care of the place with that which makes flesh until the weak one heals. 
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the Treatment of Eyelash Ailments. 
Caput X.	Chapter Ten. 
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat which is generated in the tunic of the upper eyelid; and it most often happens to boys; and it weighs down their eyes, and they have catarrhs in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun, because tears rush to them, and on account of that you see them lying face down upon themselves always, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are moist beneath their eyebrows, which already has been covered by swelling; and indeed the eminence of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.  
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is for the patient to put his head in your lap. 
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare on it tow, and make from the tow a circle according to the quantity which contains the Axirnath on all sides.  
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place him upon it and press with your fingers from all sides so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle. 
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with an entering scalpel fissures across its width, and let there not be a fissure larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth. 
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you cut all the skin until you reach the Axirnath; for in many dispositions the Axirnath proceeds from the fissure according to the shape of a white tallow candle.  
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it with the cloth which you inserted between your fingers to the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and beware lest you add anything in the fissure so that you do not reach with the scalpel to the eye and injure it. 
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you add a little into the fissure with ease until the Axirnath proceeds.  
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said. 
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with bandages.  
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are those among men who grind salt, and put it into the hollow of the fissure so that it liquefies what remains from that moisture. 
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if a hot abscess should occur there, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals. 
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the methods of treating a relaxed eye, that is, when the eyelid softens, causing it to bulge as it should not. 
Caput XI.	Chapter XI. 
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs in addition to the natural course of hairs are born on the eyelids, and grow crooked: then they harm the eye, and cause illnesses to occur, such as continuous tears, and softening of the eyelids, and leukoma, until it becomes a cause of the destruction of the eye.  
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, relaxed eye is treated according to four methods. 
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire. 
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, as previously stated in the chapter on cautery.  
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or relaxed eye is treated by incision and suture. 
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by means of canes, as I will explain.  
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the sick person on your lap. 
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	Therefore if it is turned, it is good.  
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with thread penetrate from above, so that it is near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs are born: then draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a rod. 
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with the spatula incident from the larger lacrimal to the smaller lacrimal. 
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and place under the eyelid a small ball of lint from cotton or cloth; then mark upon the eyelid with cerate in the form of a myrtle leaf. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However it is necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid; because this is now diversified in men. 
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For among them there are some who need a large quantity to be cut from the eyelid according to the quantity that is softened by the eyelid. 
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spatula find above the two lines that you have marked and begin from the larger lacrimal to the smaller lacrimal, and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs as is the thickness of a ray.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. 
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scarify the entire skin itself.  
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then join the two lips with suture using a sharp needle and fine wool thread; and wash away the blood, and make what overflows from the threads adhere to the two eyebrows with certain occult things if you wish to do this; and if not, do not care.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days, then afterward take care of it. 
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without suture and care for it with that which dries and constricts it.  
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid rises at the sealing of the wound and its joining; but it will be better in the future. 
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of healing was taught by the ancients according to Ataxmir.  
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However there is anxiety about the sick person, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it. 
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And there is another method in Ataxmir also; and it is that you mark upon the eyelid a figure which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf as we have narrated. 
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then raise the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks, according to this form, and then cut off what overflows with small forceps, according to this form, with equal incision. 
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not fit: then take a needle with thread in it, and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger lacrimal, and a second thread near the smaller lacrimal; and join the threads between your fingers equally.  
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin above which is the marked cot, as we have described.  
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two lips of the wound with suture; and care for it until it heals. 
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if an abscess should occur at your incision or fissure: dry it up with cerate and the like, from soothing ointments. 
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens that the eyelashes of the eyelid also turn around. 
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you must use what we said in the incision; but the suture for both is more artful.  
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Concerning the care of Ataxmir with dogs. 
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	AND it is necessary to turn the eyelid and split the fissure that is within, according as I have described.  
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two canes, or two slender pieces of wood; whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and whose width is less than the width of a span; and you have already cut into the ends of each from both sides where you hold the threads.  
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then join each with subtlety over what overflows from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten the two canes from both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. 
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin that is tightened will die and blacken and putrefy until it falls off by itself. 
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is delayed, cut it with forceps. 
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it becomes firm, elevate the eyelid: and the hairs do not sting. 
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two tubes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width. 
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On raising stinging hairs in the eye with a needle. 
Caput XII.	Chapter Twelve.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation on it is, that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, soft thread from silk.  
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you gather its extremities, and tie both with a fine knot very tightly: and let the length of the threads be one palm. 
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place another fine thread under it briefly in an Alinxotati, and tie its extremities if you wish. 
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient put his head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation is declared: because it is a subtle, or minute operation. 
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out from above the natural hair.  
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up to above the Alinxotati: and insert into the Alinxotati that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, no more. 
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it until the hair emerges with the Alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural hair. 
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the Alinxotati is drawn, and the hair does not emerge with it: draw the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you placed in it, until the Alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with the eye's vision: then indeed draw the Alinxotati and the thread: and pull out both, and close the eye: and let it remain closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.  
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from natural hairs, and raise it with it; or leave it alone until it lengthens after a while, and then raise it. 
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the care of alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid. 
Caput XIII.	Chapter Thirteen. 
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.  
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this alxatrati is either natural or accidental. 
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental therefore arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things to these.  
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in this is that you open that consolidation and separate its lips, and put into it a ligature of linen thread, and bind it until it heals.  
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary that you use things in its treatment which dry and constrict: for if you do that, the alxatrati returns worse than it was; rather use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek; and embrocate with water in which marshmallow root and flaxseed have been boiled; and ointment of dyaquilon which has been liquefied with some oil; and wrap it with a linen cloth, and care for it with that. 
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is, that you try with all your ingenuity, so that it does not consolidate according to the form which it was at first. 
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And indeed this operation which we have said is not except a certain correction of the alxatrati, so that it does not return to the form of the place according to what it entirely was. 
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the care of alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkle or contraction upward to the right and left. 
Caput XIIII.	Chapter Fourteen.  
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This alxatrati which occurs below is the one that truly is called alxatrati. 
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	It is natural and it is accidental. 
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental kind is made from a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and things similar to those. 
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of operation on it is that you take a needle with a double thread and stain it with flesh color, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh. 
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel. 
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	Therefore if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.  
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a ray and place it in the fissure and turn it with the eyelid; and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision until they meet and form an angle: until when they come together the shape of them becomes this shape, and it is the letter lambda.  
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount which is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid. 
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separate parts; sew them with wool thread.  
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we said, about softening medicines and cleansing ones, until they are healed. 
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a luxation should happen from the fissure and suture or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the eyelashes of the eyelid, also according to what preceded.  
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with cleanser, according to what we said. 
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the speech about the care of luxation, when it is above or below, is that the operation runs in it according to what is prepared from the form of the luxation. 
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it itself is of many different forms; and a skillful craftsman prepares his ingenuity with whichever way is possible for him, until he may return the shape to its natural form or near it, and himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many positions.  
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea. 
Caput XV.	Chapter Fifteen. 
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural operations. 
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you must insert the extremity of a radius under the eyelid and raise it upward; or extend it with a hook; then incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which is not sharp like the incision of other spatulas, but rather slightly blunt: so that the weak person is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed and does not injure the eye with its sharpness; and let your incision be as if you were scraping away that adhesion easily, until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed. 
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, with blue water itself; or distill into it from a sieve made, from ziniar dissolved with water. 
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with flaxseed linen; and place wool infused with egg white on the eye; and after the third day use a sieve, and with compresses, until it is healed. 
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Concerning the incision of the nail and eminence of the lacrimal flesh.
Caput XVI.	Chapter Sixteen. 
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is according to two ways.  
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is nervous; and it is similar to a hard, thin reed. 
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white humidity; which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off, and the hook does not stick in it.  
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin except from the larger lacrimal, until it gradually spreads, until it covers vision and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating in its incision is: that the weak person should place their head in your lap. 
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and raise his eyelid with your hand. 
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take a nail with a small hook and extend it upward. 
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, ox, or cow; and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail; and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upward: and flay with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were to grasp it with the hair up to its end. 
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the lacrimal with a fine speculum, or with small forceps; and let go the natural flesh of the lacrimal, so that a constant course of tears does not occur from its incision.  
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with the hook alone; or with thread, as we have said. 
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then flay it with a gentle speculum, which has this shape.  
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful that the speculum does not touch the corneal tunic, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is perforated. 
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw something crushed salt, or made from a sieve out of ziniar into the eye and leave it until the next day.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is necessary until it is healed. 
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	But if the nail is not nervous and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor does a hook attach to it, then this kind of nail is often healed with medicine, and is healed as I have related in the division. 
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	But if you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the sick person and take a subtle, gentle, dull-pointed speculum, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from above with reason and subtlety. 
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it becomes thin and breaks up, and a razor presses into it, then distill from your hour into the eye a sieve made of zinc, or a red sieve, or ground salt; and bathe the eye until another day. 
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation on it until all of it is removed. 
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in your eye; for then let it alone and treat the abscess until it heals. 
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with a razor until it heals. 
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	But if the prominence of the tear duct causes great harm to the eye, suspend it with a hook and cut a part from it; and do not close the incision so that the course of tears does not occur.  
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then instill into the tear duct a red sieve or one made from zinc until it heals. 
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision of Alguardenic and flesh born in the eye. 
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.  
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes red flesh is born in the eyes of some men, superimposed or composed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or tightens upon the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it resembles a rose balustrade. 
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And there is also an operation on it, so that the sick person places his head on your lap. 
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and collect all that flesh with suitable hooks; and hold it with one forceps or a hand. 
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first until all of it is finished with a surgical knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful of the eye so that you do not injure it during the operation; and let your incision with which you cut it, be either with a scalpel, which we have described in the incision of a nail, or with small forceps, with which pus is collected, according to what its form will come after this chapter.  
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is complete, and the whole of the algardenici is removed, then fill the eye with pounded salt: or distill into it red powder, and those similar to it from corrosive medicines: and put on the eye outside cotton with linen so that it may be guarded against a hot abscess. 
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	But if anything remains of the algardenici, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye alone, and treat it with that which subdues an abscess.  
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the procedure upon it until it is healed. 
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do similarly with added flesh which occurs in the eye from this kind.  
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However it is necessary that strangers should perform the treatment of every weak eye from natural or accidental causes with iron; and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that that member can tolerate it. 
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the Collection of Sebum from the Eye.  
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebum are red veins which spread over the eye and prevent vision from its operation: and they weaken the eye with the length of days.  
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary therefore for you first to consider if the eye in which there is sebum is strong and there is no sickness in it except the sebum: then collect its sebum. 
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary that you instruct the weak person to put their head in your lap.  
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be subtle of double shape, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded into one body, according to this form. 
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with subtle forceps with subtlety, and wash away the blood hour by hour until you see those veins being removed from the eye and resolved; and be careful not to injure the eye with the ends of the speculum.  
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	Let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be very steadfast in your operation so that you do not fall except upon those veins. 
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then distill into the eye a green or red sieve so that its sharpness may corrode what remains from the sebum. 
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with something which quiets the pain of the eye and let it be for several days until its pain subsides and guard it from a hot poultice; then repeat upon it in the same manner until it is healed. 
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps. 
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Concerning the reduction of a deviated septum to the nose.  
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX. 
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call a deviated septum a fistula, which you should treat with a cautery or with a sharply burning medicine, according to what was previously stated concerning it. 
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it except to cut above the abscess at its origin and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus until the opening is exposed. 
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	Therefore, when the opening is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then excise it with an instrument whose form is this. 
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called an Asperi's head. 
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like an azir, which should be punctured with the puncture of a file or with a delicate puncture of a sharp chisel and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone. 
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then revolve it between your fingers and press your hand upon it a little while until you know that the corruption has already been scraped away; and do this several times. 
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying astringent medicines.  
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	Therefore, if the place consolidates and flesh grows in it and the flow of blood is cut off; and it remains for forty days and does not reoccur and does not become abscessed and no accident happens to it: then you know that it has already been healed. 
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it except to reduce the fistula to the nostril orifice, according to this manner. 
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, so that you expose the second bone with an iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone has been exposed, then take an auger according to this manner, let its iron end be triangular: and let its wood be a pyramid tapered down to the extremity, as you see. 
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that upon the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct; and extend your hand a little from the eye. 
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then revolve your hand with the auger until it penetrates the bone, and it feels weak; through this it finds wind coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose. 
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with styptic drying medicines, as I taught you. 
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens; then the matter which was flowing to the outside, returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter upon the weak spot.  
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the Reduction of an Eye Prominence. 
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When an eye protrudes with its entirety, and there is no vision impairment, nor diminution; then it is necessary that you loosen the weak spot: then phlebotomize him: afterwards apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification, but with suction. 
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place upon the eye a liniment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla.  
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye from above upon a plaster with many powders. 
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the manner of powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and double every cloth from them over four; make many from them; then place them one upon another, according to the amount which the eye needs: then bind upon them with a hard cloth, a strong binding. 
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat aspirations with a syringe without scarification. 
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the aspirated fluid, and let the eye be kept closed day and night. 
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the ligament again becomes softened, then it must be tightened much; then remove the ligature after a day and night, as we have said. 
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	Therefore, if you see the eye has already returned to its former tunic, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the poultices, and the ligature, and the aspirations until it is healed. 
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the Incision of the Vitreous Tunic. 
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.  
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the vitreous tunic, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a seed of the vitreous, and spoils the appearance of man because of it, and there is a desire to excise it: then the operation on it is as follows, according to what I relate: and it is, that you introduce a needle into the root of the vitreous from the lower to the upper part. 
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle in which there is a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate; and let the first needle go according to its own position. 
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the vitreous around the needle; and tighten it very much. 
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the needle, and place wool steeped in albumen over the eye; and let him be, until the thread falls with the vitreous. 
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with what strengthens it, until the wound is healed. 
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the vitreous is constricted from every side with a circle made of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.  
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then perforate it with a fine trocar that reaches the depth of the eye, and let the albuminous moisture flow, and let the eye descend, and enter immediately; then tighten it until it is healed. 
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of al-qonmāti. 
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII. 
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment which is called al-qonmāti is nothing but a humor that collects in the eye, resembling descending water, and is not itself.  
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is to have the patient sit upon a prepared seat, or straight. 
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head with your hands on both sides and move it until you see the humor come down towards your eyes. 
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then fix it so that it does not descend, and clear the vision; and let the patient see things as he used to see; and if it does not descend below, you know that it is water.  
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent of the humor is not prepared as we said, then make the patient sit between your hands. 
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula and with it make an incision above the corneal membrane a little at the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the crown until the humor emerges.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it therefore emerges, then distill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.  
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract. 
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII. 
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken of the kinds of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing speech explaining and setting forth; then take that same thing according to health.  
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary for you to make the patient sit between your hands squarely, opposite the light near the sun; and bind his sound eye, and bind it tightly; then hold down the eyelid of his eye with your right hand if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand if the eye is the right. 
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand an al-ma'ghazal if the eye is the left; or with your left hand if the eye is the right. 
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the almaga near the cornea for the width of a radius in the white of the eye apparent below the lesser lachrymal; then press the almaga with force and turn your hand with it until it enters into the albuginea of the eye; and you will feel that the almaga has now reached the empty space. 
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almaga to its depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and this is the cornea of the eye. 
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see it in the pupil itself by the vision of the eye, on account of the clarity of the tunic of the cornea.  
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almaga up to the place where there is water. 
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it down below with juice one after another. 
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	And if therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick man sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almaga in his eye. 
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little while. 
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	And if therefore the water descends, then place it second beyond that by which the almaga comes out. 
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed and does not ascend; then draw out the almaga with ease; and you turn your hand little by little. 
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something of clear salt of gems in water; and wash the eye within it. 
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place outside the whole eye a plug, or wool steeped in rose oil, and albuginea; and bind it with the sound eye. 
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We however, and those who are of our time, place upon it pounded cuminum with albuginea. 
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	But if the almaga does not obey you to enter into the eye on account of its hardness because it is from men whose eyes are very hard; then it is necessary for you to take a speculum, which is called an Alberid, whose form is this: 
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore perforate it only with this conjunctiva and not your whole hand into the hole; and there is nothing else to do except make a way to the almond-shaped place underneath. 
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almond as we have said. 
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the sick man a well-made bedchamber in which he may sleep upon his back in a darkened room; and prohibit him from all motions and coughing; and give him food that soothes his nature; and let him not move his head to the right or left at all. 
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the ligature be according to its arrangement until the third day. 
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that darkened room and test his sight; and have him see things.  
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then return the ligature until the seventh day. 
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not fitting that he do this at the hour of healing or immediately after the incision; but rather, that others do it; because water ascends quickly through a forceful opening. 
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a hot swelling occurs; then it is fitting that you loosen the eye before the seventh day and correct it with that which stills the swelling until it is stilled; then release his sight, and place upon his face a covering by which his vision may be regulated under those days, with him being in that darkened room. 
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him go out from the house gradually and frequent his own affairs.  
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in surgery the student is not excused from sight often; then let him dare upon the operation. 
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed there has come to us a certain one of those who are from Al-Arayrakh, who said that a device was made in Al-Arayrakh which is perforated so that it sucks up water. 
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has made this; nor have I read of it in any ancient book; and it is possible that it is new. 
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	These are the forms of species from the ulcer, so that it may stand over him who does not know them. 
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of bronze properly: and let their extremities be with this same subtlety triangular, and the extremity acute. 
Formae magda.	Forms of ulcers. 
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Concerning the treatment of flesh born on the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes diverse added fleshes are born in the nose, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion of many feet; and from it is cancerous flesh, stony, of a dark color; and from it is that which is soft flesh, not of a dark color. 
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, in that which is soft flesh from these fleshes, not fraudulent nor cancerous, it is necessary for you to make the weak one sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and throw a hook into those fleshes; then draw them outwards, and cut what you have grasped from them with a thin sharp scalpel on one side, until you know that all the flesh has now been removed. 
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	And if anything remained from that which its excision is not possible: then shave it with one of the subtle instruments with ease, until nothing remains from it. 
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it by what is necessary: or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hurry to cauterize it until the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed. 
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then vinegar and water, or wine, should be thrown into the nose after the incision. 
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you know that it is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that there is flesh born within it on the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision. 
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to insert a linen thread which has some thickness, and make many knots in it; and place the distance of a finger, or less, between each knot: and have the weak one guide one end of the thread into his nose with a rod, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it like a plowshare; and pull on his own odor until it reaches the back, and comes out over his throat. 
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And very often they do something like this dissection of a boy in schools; and it is an easy thing for whoever wants to do it. 
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that goes over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose. 
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then apply a carneal lock with the knots that are in the thread. 
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already joined with the knots of the thread. 
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread and put in the nose after washing away the blood a linen cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days, or more, until the ointment eats away all that remains from the flesh.  
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then finally put a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals. 
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it needs treatment that will dry it up, use that.  
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a nasal inhaler, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it from silver or bronze: it should be like a small lamp, open like a shell; and its passageway similarly. 
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed. 
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making a nasal inhaler should be full and open; it should have a handle at its end with which you hold it when heating oil or whatever you wish from juices and flowing things in it. 
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument. 
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the care of a broken nose. 
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.  
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Very often a swelling arises at the end of the nose and it magnifies and increases with days until its appearance becomes ugly.  
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that it is necessary to cut into it at the beginning of its appearance and eradicate all of it. 
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place on top of the spot either a cautery or a burning medicine that takes its place.  
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	Therefore, if the incision of this is delayed until it grows larger, then consider, if it is stony, hard, dark in color, and insensitive: then do not touch it with iron; for it is a cancerous ulcer. 
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen those who suffered a felon and great misfortune came upon him who had it.  
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the felon is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout its entirety, then evacuate the weak spot, and cut it without fear, without hesitation: and care for the place with that which dries and constricts, until it heals. 
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, lip, and ear. 
Caput XXVI.	Chapter Twenty-Six. 
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a disruption of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit results from surgery except in certain individuals.  
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when it happens to someone that they suffer one of these things, you must consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then join the two lips of the wound together with suture: then care for it until it heals.  
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the disruption have already been separated and each part has become healthy; then it is necessary that you scrape away all the skin from its surface until it bleeds. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join the two lips together with suture and tighten them, and sprinkle dragon's blood and ground frankincense over it; and place a piece of diachylon plaster and some other consolidating plaster on top of the powders, and leave it bound for two or three days.  
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then unbind it and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads separate on their own. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.  
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is to join the disruption together either with needles as we have described in suturing the abdomen or to join the disruption with thread as I have taught you. 
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the Extraction of Nodes from the Lips. 
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII. 
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people indeed have hard swellings within their lips, similar to grains of herb, some smaller and some larger. 
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, you must turn back the lip and cut over each node, suspending it with a hook and cutting into it from all sides. 
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with powdered tragacanth until the bleeding stops. 
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then wash it with vinegar and treat the area with it because of its astringent properties, until the wounds are healed. 
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the Incision of Flesh Born Over the Gum. 
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII. 
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Very often flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients call an abuluss.  
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you must either suspend it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, allowing the pus to flow or the blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place powdered tragacanth or other astringent, drying powders over the area. 
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	But if the flesh returns after treatment, which often happens, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after cautery. 
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the Scraping of Teeth with Iron.  
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX. 
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough and foul crusts accumulate on the surfaces of teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums, often becoming blackened, yellowish, and even greenish, until corruption from them spreads to the gums, making the teeth foul. 
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore you must make the weak person sit between your hands and place their head in your lap, then with a file and rasp remove any crusts from the teeth where they appear to you like sand until nothing remains. Do the same for blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other discolorations until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	Therefore, if that which is in them from the beginning of reasoning is taken away, it is good; and if not, then iterate reason over them on another day, the second, and the third, until finally study reaches what you wish. 
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth needs razors of various shapes, many figures; according to how your operation is prepared; for which the razor with which the tooth is shaved from the lower part is different from the razor with which it is shaved between the teeth, according to other forms. 
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And let these forms of razors be prepared by you, which you see. 
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the Extraction of Painful Teeth. 
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX. 
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You ought to cure the tooth from its pain with all your ingenuity, and delay in its eradication.  
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing which can supply its place when it is eradicated, because it is a lofty substance: until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it ought to be eradicated when the infirm one is forced, so that it may be strengthened and certified by you as a painful tooth.  
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Very often pain deceives the infirm, and they think that it is in the tooth which is sound and eradicate it; then the pain does not recede until the infirm tooth is eradicated.  
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen this from the operation of phlebotomists. 
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Therefore, when the painful tooth itself is certified by you, it ought to be scarified around with a spatulum, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened from every part: then move it yourself with your fingers or with subtle forceps at first gradually, until you shake it. 
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps there with a good placement and the head of the infirm one between your knees which you have already held well so that it does not move: then draw the tooth according to straightness so as not to break it. 
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and insert it under it from every part with ease, and try its movement as you did at first. 
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If, however, a tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill the hole with cloth and tie it with the end of a fine wire so that it does not break during the time you constrict it with forceps. 
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you must act very carefully with the scarring all around the gum on every side. 
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and it returns upon the weak one from that evil which is greater than his first pain. 
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness in its eradication, beyond what we have described to be administered. 
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Very often they cause great infirmities to befall men, which are more difficult to break, and all its roots or some of them remain, or that they extract it with some bones of the mandible: as we have testified many times. 
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then wash after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt. 
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If it should happen that blood flows from the places (for this often happens), then apply something from zegi and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if zegi does not offer itself to you.  
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the subtle forceps with which a tooth is moved first should have long shafts, a short handle, and be thick so that they do not bend when pressed upon a tooth: they should be like you see with large handles, until when you squeeze them they do not give way or bend; short shafts, and made of good iron or steel properly forged, straight-edged shafts: and on their extremities there should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and tighten with decent, strong constriction.  
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the extremities are made like the shape of the mouth of a bird which is called a stork and they are strong constrictions. 
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth, and the extraction of broken jaw bones. 
Caput XXXI.	Chapter Thirty-One. 
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains something broken during the removal of a tooth, it is necessary to place a compress with butter on the spot for one or two days until the area softens; then introduce an elevator or forceps into it, whose ends are similar to the beak of a bird called a stork. 
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This is the shape of these forceps.  
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their extremities be made like a file inside: or like an awl. 
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not obey you in order to exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carve above the root and detach all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever, whose shape is this. 
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let its extremity be short and slightly thick, and let it not be soaked so that it does not break.  
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	Therefore, if the root comes out through that, it is good; and if not, you must pry with these other instruments whose shapes are these.  
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first has a triangular extremity, in which there is a certain thickness. 
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the second has a slender triangular extremity. 
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	You can also pry with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is this. 
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with the other instruments and tools that preceded for the reason of teeth.  
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	You can also pry with this instrument which resembles a large hook of this shape, with a twisted triangular extremity, in which there is a certain thickness so that it does not break; and let it not be soaked.  
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that dental instruments are many; and similarly, the remaining instruments are not counted, and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, invents an instrument for himself according to what the operation and illnesses themselves indicate to him. 
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because there are illnesses from which the ancients did not say an instrument, due to the diversity of their kinds.  
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are broken, or become putrid: then carefully examine it in its place with the instruments and forceps which I have mentioned for the extraction of roots, and aid it with a speculum, the form of which is as follows. 
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be something of a moderate size in it, so that the mouth may be drawn tight or held with it, and does not escape and wander, until the bone comes out; and restore the place with suitable medicines for that purpose. 
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a little putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it clean of its putrefaction and care for it until it heals. 
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the Locking of Teeth Which Project Beyond Others. 
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII. 
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, it makes the form ugly; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those who are marriageable. 
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, or its locking is not possible, nor its filing: then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, the form of which is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small beak, and is made of hardened iron, with a very sharp end. 
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be made upon it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and that another tooth may not be disturbed. 
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it projects exposed to filing: then file it with a file of hardened iron, the form of which is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle have very small points, just like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth may be filed gradually over many days easily so that the tooth is not disturbed and falls out; then soften it at the end and extract it with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is dense, from which a part breaks off and injures the tongue, then it must be filed even until the roughness of that fracture is removed and it is made equal; and smoothed, so that it does not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech. 
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the Retention of Teeth with Gold Wires. 
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter Thirty-Three. 
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer a concussion and contusion from a blow or fall, and the infirm person cannot hold anything they eat on it lest it fall out: and you have treated them with astringent medications, but the treatment has not been successful; then there is an ingenious way to bind them with gold wire: for silver turns green and decays after a few days, but gold never changes. 
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be medium in fineness and thickness according to the amount that fits between the teeth. 
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the method of retention is as follows: you take the wire and insert a double length of it between two sound teeth; then you weave the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether there is one or more, until you reach with the weaving up to a sound tooth on the other side. 
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving back to the side where you started; and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it is not moved at all; and let your constriction where you bind the wire be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose. 
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the wire with forceps; and join both ends together and twist them with a gesture; and conceal them between a sound tooth and a loose tooth so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it remain tightened in this way. 
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it loosens or breaks, bind them again with another wire and it will remain thus for the whole time. 
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the shape of the teeth and the figure of the retention of two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see. 
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after a fall and are retained as we have described and remain; and this is not done except by a skillful, prudent, and experienced craftsman. 
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes one of the vaccine bones is adapted and made into the shape of a tooth, and it is placed in its place, from which the tooth is fortified and tightened as we said, and it remains and serves for a long time. 
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On the Incision of a Ligament Which Occurs Under the Tongue and Prevents Speech.  
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed. 
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is to open the mouth of the sick person in your lap and lift up his tongue; then cut that nervous ligament across its width until the tongue is freed from its restraint. 
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something of hardness and nodulation in it, and if it is from the healing of a wound, then project a hook into it and pierce it across its width until you strike the ligament and loosen the nodulation. 
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful that there is no fissure deep in the flesh, and that you do not cut into an artery there, lest blood flow occur. 
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wash the area of the incision with rose water or vinegar, or cold water.  
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen ligature under the tongue, which the sick person should hold in his mouth every night so that it does not heal back together again. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if bleeding occurs, then put powdered alum on the area.  
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a lenticular cautery which is suitable for it; then care for it as with the rest of the treatment until it heals. 
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the Extraction of a Ranula Which Occurs Under the Tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter Thirty-Five 
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth. 
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	The operation on it is to open the sick person's mouth in front of the sun and consider the abscess. 
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	Therefore, if you see it to be of a dark or black color, hard, and one to which the sick person does not feel sensation: then do not touch it, for it is cancer. 
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	But if it inclines toward whiteness, and there is moisture in it, then thrust a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from every part. 
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	And if blood overcomes you during your operation, then place ground zedoary upon it until the bleeding stops; then return to your operation until you extract it with all its contents.  
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then gargle it with vinegar and salt; and care for it with the remaining treatment suitable for it until it is healed. 
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the Treatment of an Abscess of Two Tonsils. 
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat glands, which are called almonds,  that protrude outward; and they are called two tonsils: when you treat these as we have said in division, and they do not heal, then consider. 
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	Therefore if it is an abscess that is hard, dark in color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is reddish in color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but rather let it mature.  
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either pierce it or it will burst on its own. 
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and has a slender root: then you must cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is that before its operation you should consider if the abscess has become quiet, and its heat completely subsided, or whether it diminishes somewhat; then make the sick person sit in front of the sun, and let their head be in your lap; open their mouth, and let a servant take it between his hands and press the tongue down with an instrument, which is shaped as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of bronze, which is as fine as a knife. 
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	Therefore when you press with it the tongue, and an abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the amygdala, and draw it forth externally as much as you are able, besides which you draw with it something from the tunics. 
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then incise it with an instrument, of which this is the following form. 
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is assimilated to forceps: nevertheless the extremities of it are curved, so that the opening of each one of them is directed into the other acutely: whence care should be taken that it is made of tempered iron, or silver imbued with brass. 
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then incise it with a scalpel, of which this is the form.  
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side. 
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have incised one amygdala, incise the other according to this same kind of incision.  
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water. 
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there should happen to him a flow of blood, let him gargle with water in which have been boiled the husks of pomegranates: or myrtle leaves, and such like from astringents, until the flow of blood is cut off: then care for it, until it heals.  
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes there arise in the throat other abscesses, besides the two amygdalae. 
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore incise them according to what I said in the incision of the two amygdalae equally.  
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself indeed have already treated a woman from an abscess, which had arisen between her throat, which was drawing it to a burning, few senses, which already almost closed the throat: and the woman was breathing from a narrow passage, and already prohibited her eating, and drinking water: and already she had arrived at death, if it had remained one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the swelling had risen so high that it had sent forth two branches, until they extended beyond the two nostrils. 
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Therefore I hastened and fixed a hook into one of them. 
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I drew it out, and a large portion was extracted from it.  
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where it was grasped from the nostril. 
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to that which protruded from the other nostril. 
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed down her tongue; and afterward I fixed a hook into the swelling itself; then I cut off a portion from it, and only a little blood flowed from it; therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took food.  
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut from that swelling many times over a long period; and the swelling would succeed in the place where I had cut, until it was prolonged excessively and came out with it. 
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I then devised and cauterized the swelling between her throat. 
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore it stopped from growing; then I departed, and did not know what God did with her after me.  
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the Incision of a Swelling of the Palate. 
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter Thirty-Seven. 
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When phlegm descends to the palate and swells up and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a vault. 
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment does not succeed; and you see that the swelling has become quiet and thin from it, then it is necessary to cut into it.  
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is round and gathered from it, and does not have length, and is bloody or tawny colored or black, and has no sensation; then it is necessary to make an incision into it. 
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear concerning the weak one.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore it is necessary that when you see it according to the manner I have said from its whiteness and length, you should make the weak person sit before the sun, and press their tongue with the instrument of which I have previously spoken; then fix a hook in the uvula and draw it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned for cutting the two tonsils. 
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you not cut from it except that which is added beyond the natural term without addition. 
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will injure the voice and speech. 
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use that which we have narrated in the incision of the two tonsils; and care for it until it heals. 
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the weak person is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread. 
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in it is not except with sharp water; and it is, that you place the head of the weak person in your lap. 
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press their tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned. 
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I have told you in the chapter on cauterization and mix it with a coal not extinguished, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill from it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the shape. 
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremity in which medicine is placed have a concavity, like the concavity of a radius cochlea.  
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with medicine on the uvula itself; and let the weak person lie on their side so that saliva runs from their mouth out of the inner medicine, so that nothing descends from it to their throat and harms them. 
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine. 
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first place it on the uvula for half an hour, until you see it already blackened and the bite of the medicine subdued. 
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a piece of cotton and wrap it over the end of the radius, and infuse the cotton with medicine, and introduce the radius with the cotton into the cannula from above, until the cotton adheres onto the tip. 
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you desire concerning the cauterization of the vein. 
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it alone; for it will dry up and fall off after three days or four. 
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	And if you wish to iterate the medicine, repeat it; and after the cauterization wash around the vein with cotton soaked in butter, and cleanse it of what is around it from the medicine; and bathe it with cold water. 
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed. 
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this kind of treatment is healthier than incision and further from danger.  
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes a vein is also treated with something more subtle than cautery and incision; for it is treated with fumigation, in this manner. 
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamus, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sage, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and things like them from herbs; and gather all these together, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and let them boil; and the pot should be plastered well with clay; and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which an instrument concave in shape is placed. 
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or bronze; and insert the extremity, in which there is a pomegranate, into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor rises to the vein above the cannula, until the vein becomes very dark.  
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat it over it many times, until it dries up. 
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful not to do this treatment at the beginning of the arrival of an abscess. 
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it usually adds to the abscess; and it is not right for you to do this unless at the decline of its heat.  
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If you do not have this instrument present, then take a tube and put bark on the end of it so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned; for the bark prevents vapor from burning the mouth; and this is good healing with safety. 
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the Extraction of Thorns and Bones from the Throat. 
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-Eight. 
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Very often a bone or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat. 
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore you must extract what is apparent from them upon which vision falls after you press the tongue with an instrument toward the sun, and it is declared to you what is in the throat. 
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must make the sick person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach. 
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps the attached thing will go out through vomiting. 
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the sick person swallow a piece of turnip or a lettuce root, or swallow a mouthful of dry bread; or take a piece of dried gentle sea sponge and tie it with thread, then swallow it. 
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it reaches the place where the spines or bone are, and they are extracted, then they come out.  
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form. 
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be somewhat thicker than a spoke and let there be a curve at the end of it, so that it may enter his throat easily; and let him have his head elevated upward. 
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And be careful of touching his epiglottis so that coughing does not happen to him and he drives out the bone or spine with it, or let the doctor introduce it with his own hand. 
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But for the sick person to introduce it is better: because of his knowledge of the location of the attached thing; and he drives it down or pulls his hand upward with the instrument, all of it according to the quantity that is prepared for him until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the Extraction of a Leech. 
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX. 
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is treated with what I have said in the division on healing with medicines and it does not detach, then consider in the throat of the sick person in front of the sun, or by the sun after you press its tongue with an instrument which I have described to you. 
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with delicate forceps discreetly. 
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	And if this is not possible with them: then take a concave cannula and insert it into the throat of the sick person up to near the throat; then insert iron heated with fire into the concavity of the cannula. 
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times, and let the sick person abstain from all water for a whole day. 
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a goblet full of cold water and open his mouth into it; and moisten his mouth with it and not swallow anything from it; and stir the water with his hand one hour after another. 
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls off. 
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not depart with what we have described, then fumigate the sick person with bedbugs, or with asafoetida with an instrument which I have described in the fumigation of the uvula. 
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for it will fall off.  
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the manner of operation in fumigation is to take a pot in which there are live prunes with fire; and let the pot be covered with a lid, in the middle of which there is a hole; and let the extremity of the instrument be placed into that hole. 
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then project the fumigation and let the sick person place his mouth at the extremity of the cannula and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech. 
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall off. 
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation many times. 
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt things, and garlic, and let him not drink water. 
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he goes out with this regimen. 
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls upon it by sight. 
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And the extremity of it is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is roughness like a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all. 
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and care in general.  
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of many ways, according to what comes to the recollection of them, namely one, and one in this book: and they are different in their perforation, and incision of themselves in two ways. 
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the kind of abscess itself, and that because it comprises from humidities.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second way is on account of the places, in which it happens in the body. 
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess happening in the head is different from an abscess happening in the anus: and an abscess happening in a fleshy place is different from an abscess happening in joints: and to each of them there is a judgment of its own from the operation. 
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from abscesses there are which ought not to be perforated except after the maturation of blood in them, and its completion; and from them there are which ought to be perforated while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.  
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses which are near joints. 
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess when it happens near a joint, and is prolonged to be its own, until it putrefies what is in its circumference perhaps the ligaments, or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore there is a cause for the closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Either there is an abscess at a major limb; for if you delay its incision until it matures, it will harm either that limb or the main limb through it. 
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it while immature; and it is not necessary to perforate an abscess crude, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and a fistula be formed, or a termination thereof which does not heal. 
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You ought to know the hour of incision of an abscess, which is matured according to completeness; and it is at sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and throbbing, and sharpness of the head of the abscess; and the remaining signs. 
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same incision in the lower part of the abscess, and of more vehement eminency; and let the incision be wading in length according to the body, if the abscesses are in parts of the hands and feet, and places of muscles, and chords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection. 
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those which are reflected, wade with the incision according to that limb. 
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when an abscess is in fleshy places; then it is better that you dismiss its incision until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completeness. 
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much filth and foulness, and perhaps its lips will become hardened, and its depth. 
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body according to necessity; or according to that in which the limb needs. 
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small incision in small abscesses, and a large incision in large abscesses; or many sections through similarity to the magnitude of the abscess.  
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And they are from abscesses, in which the skin must be concave; and it should be cut when it has become like cloth, and has been made at the end, which is already dead: just as happens in many, such as boils and buboes. 
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And of these are those which are cut with a section having three angles. 
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And of these is one, from which it is cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf. 
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Such as an abscess of the groin. 
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And of these are those in which a round section and a lunar section are administered; and similar to them from sections.  
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	But that which has no head, such as mild superficial abscesses, must be perforated with a superficial perforation or only flat. 
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus and you perforate it, do not hurry and draw out all the pus in that hour; rather, draw out a part of it.  
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then close the abscess until another day. 
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then again draw out something of the pus. 
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to gradation, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man who has grown weak; for indeed the animal spirit is often resolved from the animal with the outflow of pus; and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not perceive it. 
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.  
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have perforated these abscesses, it is necessary that you wash the wound; and consider. 
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	Therefore if the wound of the abscess is small, or it is a flat section, then apply a bandage from linen or old cotton.  
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large and there are many fissures of the perforation, it is necessary then to insert a bandage into every fissure until they reach each other. 
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in an abscess you have cut off a part of the skin, or have scooped it out around its circumference: then it is necessary that you fill it with old lint, or as when cloth is woven, or shaved with flax down without moisture; and bind it up until the third day. 
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then loosen it, and care for it with what is necessary from ointment, until it heals. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if bleeding should happen during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them; and place it upon the place of the bleeding many times. 
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the bleeding should persist, then it is necessary that you administer a regimen and care, and powders which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and by division. 
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the time of winter, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you pour warm broth with wine and oil; and place them upon the places. 
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it should be in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place broth soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of it cold. 
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when it will be the third day, as we said, then it is necessary that you loosen the abscess, and wash it out, and administer in its care what suits it, until it heals. 
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This, therefore, is what is necessary from knowledge of treatment of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the way of distinction, I have now spoken of every abscess, how its way to cure is taken up individually. 
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the skin of the head.  
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41. 
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of a species of nodules, which contain sheaths, which are sacs to them: as if they themselves were like pouches of a hen. 
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of them. 
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Among them are some that are fatty; and among them are some that contain moisture like mud; and among them are some that contain moisture like curdled milk and pulps; and those similar to them; and among them are some that are hard and stony. 
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as the artery does not make resistance at their section. 
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is that you try them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what it contains. 
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then dry it by a section according to its length with a superficial section, according to this form. 
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with a section from line b to line g.  Therefore when the moisture is evacuated, then the skin kistin which contains it, and do not let anything remain within it. 
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For very often it returns if anything remains within it. 
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the stump in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day. 
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remained from the kist.  
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat upon the stump with a second, and third Egyptian ointment, and if it does not yield to that, until you are confident that nothing remained from the kist, then care for the wound with ointment until it heals. 
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	But if the abscess contains a fatty node, then dry it according to this form, with a section having the form of a cross; and project hooks between the two lips of the section, and skin it from every side; and exert your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if the artery makes resistance to you, then do what I will tell you afterward.  
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do likewise for an abscess, if it is stony, from incision and treatment the same as we have said. 
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And incision over a stony abscess is easier because there is little blood and moisture. 
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses which are in the head in some people with which there is no moisture at all. 
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is because I cut into an abscess on the head of a young woman and found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough and white, which could not be broken; and if one should strike it with a projectil it would wound the person. 
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other abscesses occurring in the head, besides these abscesses which occur in the heads of infants and at the roots of ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.  
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a puncture of them always from their lower part so that the course of blood is relieved downwards. 
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat it with what suits them from its treatment.  
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Concerning the incision of strangles in the neck. 
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Very often these abscesses occur in the neck and under the armpits and groins; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body. 
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And those that occur from them in the neck are one and many and they are generated from each other; and every strangles from them is within its own tunic as it is in nodes and abscesses of the head as we have described. 
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these strangles. 
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For some of them are stony and some contain moisture and some are malignant, which do not obey treatment. 
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore in that one which you see from them of good disposition to the touch, of which it is clear that it is close to the color of the skin and moves to every part, and is not joined with the nerves of the neck, nor the gland, nor the artery and is not deep: it is necessary that you cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b. to line g. and flay it from all sides; and extend two lips of skin with a hook or hooks if needed as we said in abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is a precaution, that a vein or nerve not be cut. 
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the knife be not very sharp, so that it does not add to your hand with the incision, nor agitate the sick person, and you may cut what is not necessary. 
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or artery, or it prevents you from the operation, then put into the wound a boiled herb, or certain powders that staunch blood, and constrict the wound, and let it be until the sharpness of the inflammation subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins to become putrid. 
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is staunched by a tunic. Return therefore to your operation until you complete it. 
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger if anything remains from the little styptics or others: therefore cut them and clean them. 
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is in the root of a stypsis a large vein: then it is necessary that you not cut that stypsis from its root: but rather that you tie it with a strong doubled thread, and let it be until it falls off by itself without harm. 
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old lint, which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment.  
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it. 
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	But if the whole stypsis is cut, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and sew it immediately after you see that there is no surplus remaining at all. 
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is a surplus remaining because of the size of the stypsis, then it is necessary that you intend to cut its root and extract it: and apply the suture as we have said. 
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And that which contains moisture from the styptics, pierce it with a superficial perforation so that the place of its maturity appears to you: and place the perforation from what follows below the body as we have said. 
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation linen with ointment and things similar to them so that it corrodes what remains from the corruption until when you see that the wound is already cleansed: then take care of it with a generative ointment of flesh until it heals. 
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the incision of the epiglottis affected by an abscess within the throat. 
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII. 
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this incision in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is the writing of their words. 
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in those who have fluxion, the epiglottis must be incised when there is no benefit from that; because all the veins and lungs are weak. 
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	But in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no pain in the canal, the epiglottis must be incised to avoid the destruction which results from premonition. 
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do this, we must cut the epiglottis below three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision in width, in that which is between the two circles by an amount that makes the incision in the flesh, not in the cartilage; and indeed this place is suitable for the incision because it is private to flesh, and blood vessels are far from it. 
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	But if the physician is timid, then he must extend the skin of the throat with a hook.  
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then let him pierce the skin until he reaches the canal; divert the blood vessels if he sees anything from them. 
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then let him cut the flesh as we have described; and it is indicated above the incision of the canal by phlegm which issues from it, with what is broken up, and cessation of voice.  
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for a time. 
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	Therefore when the hour is removed in which premonition is feared, join the two lips of the skin wound and sew it alone without cartilage. 
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.  
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this discourse which we have narrated is not exposition except when they see that some of these apostemata already has suppurated the throat of the sick person and he is raised up on the point of death and desires to intercept his breaths: they go to cutting the epiglottis so that the sick person may breathe upon the place of the wound with a certain respiration and be saved from death; and for this reason they ordered to leave the wound open until the malice of the sickness is consumed and it is the malice of this three days and as if itself: then therefore they ordered to sew the wound and to heal it until it heals. 
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I myself saw was that a certain handmaid took a knife and sent it into her throat and it fell upon a part of the pulmonary canal.  
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to her healing and I found her moaning like is the moan of a dead person. 
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore examined from the wound and I found little blood which had issued from the wound.  
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was therefore perplexed because she had not cut a vein nor her gullet and wind was coming out from the wound. 
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore hastened and sewed up her wound and healed it until it was well and nothing happened to the handmaid except hoarseness in her voice and she returned after days to a better disposition of hers.  
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	From this therefore I say that there is no fear in the cutting of the epiglottis. 
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the cutting of a hernia of the throat.  
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter Forty-Four.  
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This swelling called a hernia of the throat is a large swelling according to the color of the body and it is much in women. 
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two ways either it is natural or accidental.  
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural there is certainly no craft. 
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental however is according to two ways of which one is similar to fatty nodes.  
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	Another method is similar to an abscess which occurs from tying off an artery. 
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear within it, and it is not fitting that presumption be made against it with iron except in that which is small; and you test it, and investigate it with an Intromisso. 
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fat knot, and it is not suspended with any veins: then cut it off, as knots are cut; and extract it with that which it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then scrutinize its entirety. 
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with what is fitting from healing, until it heals. 
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the Section of Different Kinds of Knots.  
Caput XLV.	Chapter Forty-Five. 
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already said all their kinds in the division; and it is fitting that I tell here the difference between a Knot and an Excrescence: since there is a doubt-causing one. 
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore that when there is an Excrescence there is heat, and fever, and violent pains until the boiling of superfluity is calmed, and putrefaction is completed; then indeed fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But with a Knot there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain; and they contain them in cysts sifachin, which are their own sac, and it is according to the color of the body; and its beginning is like a pea, and it becomes like a date-stone, larger and smaller. 
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture.  
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in the division. 
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore it is fitting that when you come to the healing of a Knot, that you experiment on it, and inquire into it first with an instrument called an Intromisso, according to how its form will come in the chapter which follows this. 
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiry for abscesses, and all Knots, is to take this instrument, and insert it into the moister place which you find in the abscess; and you revolve your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then place your last finger according to the measurement of the size of the abscess. 
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then extract the intrument and consider that which comes out in its wake. 
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	Therefore if flowing moisture emerges, whatever its color may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, as I have said in other abscesses. 
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not emerge in the wake of the instrument, then know that it is thick: therefore dry it above with an incision in the shape of a cross, according to this form as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from every part with ease: and keep the plaster if you are able upon it so that you extract it whole with its knot. 
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the cyst ruptures during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it in pieces until nothing remains of it. 
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or a lot remains of it, the knot will return for the most part. 
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And if it overcomes you and a little remains from it: then fill the wound upon completion with certain corrosive and sharp powders: and constrict the wound and place above it what sits upon the abscess hot, and care for it with the remaining treatment until it is healed. 
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	Therefore if the knot is large, then sew its two lips together, and care for it as it heals.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if there is a vein contrary to you, pulsatile or not pulsatile: then hurry and fill the place with finely ground triturated matter, and let it remain constricted for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides: then return to incise what remains from the knot.  
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning external instruments for incision and perforation. 
Caput XLVI.	Chapter Forty-Six. 
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Among them are the forms of instruments, and they are of three kinds.  
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For from them is a great one, and from them is a medium one, and from them is a small one. 
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of well-tempered iron with square ends, so that they hasten entry into the abscess.  
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Instruments, and namely, piercing; and one of them is called a bistoury, that is, a piercer; and they are of three kinds. 
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For from them is a great one, a medium one, and a small one. 
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suited to investigate abscesses through them, and outlets, and fistulas, and buboes from what is between bones. 
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, gentle, like large needles with which sutures are taken, namely from brass, or bronze, or iron, or silver. 
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones of them are those made from brass.  
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And Instruments are also made of black lead, which are suitable so that fistulas may be investigated through them, with which there are reflections due to their concavity, so that they may be reflected gently with those reflections. 
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds. 
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from them are long ones, from them medium ones, and from them short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its tightness. 
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of Hooks, and they are of many kinds. 
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For from them are simple ones, namely those which have a single curve; and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small. 
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are blind Hooks; and they are of three kinds.  
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are Hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds; and from them are Hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds; and all these are necessary in their place.  
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of Knives, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and pared; and they are of three kinds: for from them is a great one, a medium one, and a small one.  
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities by which the section is made are sharp, other extremities are not sharp; and they are not put thus, except so that with them refreshment may be made in the excision of nodes at fear of incision of a vein or nerve; and that he who is ill may be healed by them, and find a little tranquility from the burning which he finds in the excision of an abscess. 
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are magda, and they are of three kinds. 
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of metal, and are similar to a Radiator, with which alcohol is made; and at the wide end there is a hidden Spatula point: and it runs to the inside, and outside when you wish, as you see. 
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the spatulas which are hidden between the fingers at the excision of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small. 
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Shapes of Suction Cups with which the flow of blood is cut off; and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small. 
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of metal or brass, round, a little in length as you see; and let them be delicate. 
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of Suction Cups be large and small with you so that you may cut off blood quickly when needed and then when medicine is not present for you.  
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them in the cutting off of blood in every place of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the calves of the leg, and the hip, and the calves of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar ones, from fleshy calves, moist.  
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes other small instruments are made from them similar to pistachio shells according to their shape; with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.  
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the treatment of the mammary glands of men which resemble those of women. 
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII. 
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the nipples of certain men swell up during sleep, until they resemble women's breasts, and they remain foul abscesses. 
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	He who wishes to get rid of this should make a crescent-shaped incision above the nipples, from line b to line g. Then he should remove all the skin and fat. 
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill the wound with flesh-producing medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures and care for it until it heals. 
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the nipple hangs down and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary to make two incisions on its upper sides, similar in shape to a crescent moon, each contained with the other at the ends of both, until there is a larger line containing the smaller one, according to this form from line b. to line g. Afterwards remove the skin which is between the two lips and take away the fat, and apply what we said about sutures and powders, which are necessary for healing, until it heals. 
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you cannot complete the incision as needed because of the patient's restlessness or the flow of blood: then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the perforation of an abscess which occurs under the nipple. 
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII. 
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur under the nipple are of a hard kind like a Strophulus, which contain cysts and those which contain moisture. 
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those therefore which are of the kind that contain moisture, should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form, from line b to line g. When all that is in the abscess has been evacuated as pus, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day. 
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let the shirt be removed, and let it be treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed. 
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	But if the abscess is of the type of knotty Strophulus, then cut it above it, as we said in the section on Strophulus equally. 
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the wound extends so as to discharge pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said before. 
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the section of an abscess which occurs due to Artery and Vein. 
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, then an abscess often occurs from this; and similarly it happens with a vein, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it. 
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are: because when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a rasping sound. 
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round, manifest on the body.  
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section of this abscess is an error and especially that which is under the armpits and groins and neck and in many places on the body; and it is very large. 
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, its treatment must be divided with iron, and what is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, must be divided. 
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, on that which is from them by inflation of the orifice of the artery, make a section in the skin lengthwise.  
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with hooks, then the artery; and free it from its tunics until it is exposed.  
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle under it and make it penetrate up to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples. 
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the place which is between the two ligaments with a trocar, until all the blood contained within it comes out, and the abscess is resolved. 
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply a treatment that produces pus, until the ligaments fall away; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments, until it heals. 
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	But if the abscess is due to a vein being cut, then you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess with the skin as possible. 
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you draw it out from the other side. 
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie with it the abscess with a good ligament; according to what I told you in the vein ligament, from two parts with two ends of thread. 
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the puncture; press and tighten your threads in four places.  
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is inside it comes out; then cut away the excess skin and release what was tied from it. 
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place upon it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.  
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply treatment, made with licorice and ointments until it heals. 
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning an abscess which occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter I.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, similarly an abscess occurs in nerves; which happens to them through a blow or from excessive labor and similar causes; and it most often occurs in those places where the limbs join, such as the heel, and in every place where the joints are moved, and the abscess is severe.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles the rest of the body, and it is in many positions without pain; and when it is squeezed with force, a weak sensation similar to numbness is felt within it.  
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a gathered abscess deep within the body, but rather under the skin, and itself moves to every part, and does not go forward, nor before, nor backward to the rear. 
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, that which is from them in the joints should not be invaded with iron. 
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps a contraction may occur. 
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But that which is from them in the head or forehead, cut the skin with a scalpel.  
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	And if therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it from the root. 
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and flay it: then remove it and gather the wound with sutures: and tend to it until it heals. 
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI. 
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in the other parts of their bodies, boils which are called fungal, by similarity to fungi. 
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of which is subtle, and the head is thick, and their lips are inverted. 
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there are some small ones from them, and there are some that greatly enlarge.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have indeed already seen a man, and in his belly were two boils which were more like fungi than anything else: there was no difference between them, white, of a small root, and their lips were inverted, and they split open, and moisture always flowed from them. 
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore I cut into them and found in the weight of one almost ten and eight ounces and in the other almost six ounces. And the operation in their incision is that you consider then if he is weak and moist and the color of the boil is white, moist, of a delicate root: then cut it with a broad scalpel, and have a cautery present with you in the fire. 
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For very often much blood is expelled at its incision; therefore hasten and if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it. 
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	But if you see a weak and timid person from the incision with a knife, then take a thread made of lead properly, and bind it with that thread: whose method is what we said, and let him go for two days. 
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add lead to the ligature. 
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease binding the lead whenever it presses into the wound, until it is cut off and falls by itself without labor. 
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the wart has a thick root, then there is some fear and dread in its incision; especially because it is on the abdomen. 
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However it is possible to cut into half of it.  
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it does not return. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound heals. 
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware that you do not presume to cut into a wart which is of a dark color, with little sensation, and an ugly appearance; for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I will come with the remembrance of Cancer after this.  
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the care of the prominence of the navel. 
Caput LII.	Chapter Fifty-Two.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The prominence of the navel arises from many causes.  
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures of the omentum, which is over the abdomen; and there issues forth fat, or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures. 
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood flowing from a vein, or an artery, according to what has been said previously. 
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from wind compressed within it. 
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is due to a fissure of the omentum and the issuing forth of fat; then its color resembles the color of the body; and it is soft, without pain; and appears in various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of intestine, then its location is, along with what we have described, of a more violent diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it is concealed; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it magnifies greatly at the entrance of the bath, and a vehement labor. 
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is on account of humidity, it is soft, then it is not concealed when you press it with your hand, nor does it become constricted, nor is anything added. 
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	But if it is on account of blood, then with these signs an abscess appears tending to blackness from the clefts. 
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is on account of flesh that has formed, then the abscess is heavy, thick, hard, and it is fixed according to a single quantity. 
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if it is on account of windiness, then its touch is soft.  
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the procedure in that case is, that you then consider whether the prominence of the navel is on account of blood from an Artery or Vein, or windiness; then it is necessary that you forbid its treatment. 
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I said abscesses are on account of artery and vein. 
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	But if the prominence of the navel is on account of intestine or membrane; then it is necessary that you direct the sick person to hold his breath and stand upright extended. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with sealing wax all around the circumference of the navel.  
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then direct him to lie down between your hands on his back. 
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel upon the place which you marked with sealing wax.  
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the abscess upward with a large hook. 
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it around firmly with thread or a cord made of silk with a strong binding; and let the knot of the ligament be away from the constriction. 
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the extended middle of the abscess above the ligature.  
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If then you find it already caught by a ligament: then extract the alenxotati, and insert the index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen; and if you find a zirbum, then take it up with a hook, and cut away its excess. 
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if it is an artery or vein to the contrary, then bind it very much. 
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation. 
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circumference which you made around the apostema in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate. 
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then constrict the apostema in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the extended flesh rots; and falls off by itself: or cut it when it softens and decays. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments, until it heals. 
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if the eminence of the umbilicus is from fleshous growth in it, or from moisture: then it is necessary that you make concave apostemas, as we have said. 
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood or moisture which you find in it. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what strengthens the place.  
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Concerning the Care of CANCER. 
Caput LIII.	Chapter Fifty-Three. 
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of Cancer, and how is the way to its cure with medicines; and we warned against it when curing it with iron, so as not to ulcerate it: and we spoke about Cancer generated in the womb, and cautioned against its treatment. 
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it; such as Cancer which is in the breasts, or in the thigh, and those similar to them, from the limbs located for extracting all of it; especially when it is beginning and small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is old and large, you should not approach it closely. 
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself was unable to heal anyone from it, nor did I see anyone before me who had succeeded in doing so.  
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to precede and loosen the weak part from the black bile several times. 
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomy itself if you find it with manifest fullness.  
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak part with preparation in which it will be placed during the operation. 
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then introduce into the cancer hooks that are suitable for it.  
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then scoop it out from every part with the skin, according to careful examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood flow, and do not cut it off quickly, rather press the locations and wipe away all thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instrument is possible there. 
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.  
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Concerning the treatment of Hydropsy. 
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already explained in the division the kinds of hydropsy, and how the gathering of water occurs; and the signs of each kind, and its treatment with medicine.  
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is only the kind of ascites alone; and it does not approach the kind of tympanitis with iron, nor the kind of hydrosarca deeply; for that is fatal. 
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this kind of hydropsy, tympanitis with medicine, and your medication has not been successful, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the weak person has already experienced weakness, or is with it another infirmity besides hydropsy; such as if there is a cough with it, or loosening of the bowels, and things similar to those: then beware of treating him with iron, for there is fear of that. 
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If you see a weak person with excessive humors and there is no illness with him except dropsy alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation on him is that you raise the weak person standing between your hands, and the assistant behind him presses his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest. 
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spiky speculum in this form. 
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be of two sharp points, long, with an acute extremity like a speculum. 
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there should be some slight shortness in it so that you do not pierce through to the intestines during the operation and injure them. 
Deinde considera.	Then consider.  
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the dropsy generation is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen the incision from the navel by the length of three fingers, downwards directly above the breastbone. 
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the dropsy generation is due to liver disease: then let your incision be on the left, from the navel by three fingers. 
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary for the incision to be on the side on which the weak person wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not flow to that weak spot.  
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce all the skin with an instrument. 
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision and lift your hand with the speculum between the skin and the flesh as if you are flaying it; and let the amount that is flayed be about the size of a nail or thereabouts.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the flesh until the speculum reaches the hollow place; and that is the place of the water. 
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the hole an instrument of this form.  
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a cannula: made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; with a small hole at its lower part and three holes on its sides, two on one side and one on the other: and the tip of it is cut in the manner of a reed's incision, as you see; there is a ring at its upper end.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore it evacuates from the water in an hour a medium quantity. 
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the sick man dies through the resolution of his animal spirit; or syncope happens to him which approaches death. 
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of his strength, and according to what the dispositions of the sick man signify to you from the virtue of his pulse, and from his good nature. 
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.  
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is because it is retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the hole which is above the sifac: of which I have spoken, so that you perforate it according to that manner. 
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the next day, if you see the sick man tolerate it; and evacuate also from the water a small quantity. 
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there does not remain from the water except a little. 
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the sick man, and dismiss from the water a great deal; then care for him with burial in warm sand, and much sweat in a bath and sun, and wait for thirst upon him; and care for him with drying medicines until he is healed; and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water: according to what I have spoken in that which precedes.  
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the care of infants who are born with their urine places not perforated. 
Caput LV.	Chapter Fifty-Five
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any of the infants exits from the belly of its mother, and the head of its penis is not perforated, or there is a tight opening, or it is in a not proper place.  
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary therefore to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born with a fine Spatula according to this form. 
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a fine lead plumb bob in the hole and tie it in place; hold it for three or four days. 
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	Therefore, when he wishes to pass urine, remove it and let him urinate. 
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then replace it. 
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place a lead weight, it is possible that the urine which flows over the area will prevent it from closing. 
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening is narrow should be treated with a lead weight, as we have said, for many days until it is enlarged. 
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those in whom the opening is in an unnatural place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because the opening in those who are born with it is at the end of the penis: therefore he cannot urinate forward until he lifts his penis upward with his hand. 
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor can he procreate because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line; and it is a very foul disease. 
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	The method of operation for this condition is that the patient should lie on his back. 
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand and make an incision on the top of the penis from its original position, with a sharp knife or scalpel, as though cutting a reed or radish so that the middle becomes like the head of the penis; and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should.  
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of bleeding during the procedure. 
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	It often happens. 
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore apply a styptic to him with it and care for the wound until it heals.  
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning ailments that occur in the foreskin and head of the penis, and putrefaction, blackness, and adhesion. 
Caput LVI.	Chapter Fifty-Six.  
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These ailments often occur on the penis and are a foul prominence of flesh. 
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And some of them are malignant, and some are not malignant. 
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore the non-malignant one must be suspended with a fine hook and cut off until it is entirely cleansed. 
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon it cotton submerged in Egyptian ointment. 
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it afterward with dyafinicon ointment until it heals. 
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	But if it is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary that you apply a cautery to it after its incision and the removal of its root. 
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	But if the albather is in the foreskin of a captive, uncircumcised man, and part of it is between the foreskin and part of it is outside, then you must first remove the albather which is inside; until it consolidates, then care for the one outside. For when you care for them both at the same time, the foreskin will not be secured lest it be pierced. 
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And they also sometimes occur in the testicles, and blackness and corruption of the foreskin.  
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore it is necessary that you cut out everything which has already become blackened and which is wanting to be corrupted or has already been corrupted. 
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then smear it afterward with honey which has already been mixed with flour of pomegranate rinds and crushed herb crib. 
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if there occurs a flow of blood, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery according to this form. 
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cautery is helpful for two conditions at the same time, namely for a flow of blood and for a wound when it becomes corrupted.  
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	But if the head of the penis is corroded and entirely destroyed within an hour: then it is necessary that you insert a lead cannula into the urethral opening so that the weak one may urinate upon it. 
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the case of adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur except in him whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required upon it: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound or an abscess: therefore it is necessary that you scrape it with a blunt spatula until the ligament is loosened and the head of the penis is freed from every part. 
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these exquisitely, then it is necessary to excise something from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin. 
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the foreskin is delicate it may perhaps be perforated quickly on account of its delicacy. 
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again.  
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then let it be treated with astringent wine until it firms up. 
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of injuries accidental to them.  
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII. 
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds: nevertheless since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is proper in boys, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation and an easier way leading to health. 
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws and it is only something we have acquired through experience. 
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	This is because I have found the greater part of craftsmen and phlebotomists using cleansing by circumcising with a razor and forceps; and they use cautery and ligation with thread, and incision with a nail.  
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have now tested all these methods, and I have not found a better one than cleansing with forceps and ligation with thread.  
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes. 
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the foreskin has two coats: therefore perhaps the outer skin is cut and the inner coat remains: it is then necessary to make an incision to cut the other one and pain will occur.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with cleansing which is done by cautery, that is, a tool used by shoemakers, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not safeguarded: because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing however, if the nail should happen to be caught by the iron, it spoils your operation; and the skin of a child is naturally thin, and many times they are born thus, so that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen this. 
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	The cleansing however with forceps and the tying with thread has proved a good experiment to me; because the forceps are proportionate to the incision: therefore, because the sharpness which is above, is like the sharpness which is below. 
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore when you put forth your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate and they fall according to one operation in one time; and a compression is made of a similar figure containing the skin of the rod from every side with which no error occurs at all. 
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of the proper operation is that you should estimate the boy especially, if he is one of those who understand a little, that you do not do anything except tying thread on his rod only; and let him go until another day. 
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be merry in every way as possible for you from that because he receives his own understanding. 
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands in a prepared posture and let him not be sitting; and conceal the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy does not see them at all nor anything of the instruments. 
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand to his rod and blow upon the skin and draw it up until the head of the rod comes out. 
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from that which collects on it filthiness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards tie below it a little further down a second ligature.  
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature with a good grip and cut between the two ligatures. 
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin up quickly and extract the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better) and put powder on top of it; and upon the powder a cloth in which has been spread egg yolk boiled in rose water, stirred with good fresh rose oil; and let him place it on top of it until another day; and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. 
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the forceps for cleaning is this. 
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt, and let them be incident: so that a branch of the clavicle does not come out in them; and let the length of the two points be equal to the length of two handles equally. 
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But an error occurring in cleaning is this: because perhaps the whole inner skin escapes, or a part of it at the incision. 
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your fingernail before applying the dressing to the place; and cut it according to equality. 
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	And if you are not able to hold it with your fingernail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it. 
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days pass it, and what is under the rod remains swollen, apply a dressing; then let that be until the abscess sits hot, and flay it easily, and cut it according to what is prepared for you; and beware of the head of the rod. 
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.  
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore treat it with what strengthens the wound from powders, which we have related in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut above measure from the skin, and reaches upwards, it will not harm him either.  
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it with what we have said until it heals. 
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.  
Caput LVIII.	Chapter Fifty-Eight. 
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction made from stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh grown, and similar things from those which we have said from the methods of treatment in division. 
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder; then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over on his knees. 
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak one restrain his breath as much as possible for him. 
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, with the neck of the bladder directed towards the expulsion of the stone to the rear: urine is discharged.  
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	But if it is not discharged with that which we have said, and the matter is vehement upon the weak one: then it is necessary that you administer his extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like the quill of a bird in the subtlety of a ray, long in the likeness of one and a half palms; to which there be a slender cannula at its head. 
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of the exit of urine through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and bind wool or tow at its end with a good ligature; and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut off with forceps anything superfluous from the wool, but introduce it into the cannula with vehemence, like an elevator. 
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then smear the syringe with oil, or butter, and egg white as well; and make the weak one sit upon a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its member with moist oils, olive oil, and warm water. 
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the member with ease until it reaches the root of the member. 
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it upwards from the part above the umbilicus.  
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then press the syringe within it until it reaches the bladder, and let the weak one feel that he has already reached the empty thing; and this is not done according to this order unless because the passage in which it goes is one in which there is tortuosity.  
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually. 
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the vein will follow the wool. 
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw it out, and make the vein run through the passage of urine; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do this until the bladder is emptied and the sick person finds relief. 
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of washing out the bladder with a Clepshydra. 
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX. 
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood freezes in it, or pus constricts in it, and there is a desire to distill waters and medicines into it: then let it be done with an instrument called a Clepshydra, and this is its form. 
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is deaf, that is, closed. 
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And there are three holes in it, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see. 
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is that which drives it, let it be according to the amount which it will fill itself without addition, until when it is drawn with it something is attracted from the moistures; and when it is driven, with it it is expelled afar: according to what the clepshydra does, with which naphtha is projected, that is, Greek fire in battles of Mars. 
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to project moistures into the bladder, insert the extremity of the clepshydra into the moisture, and draw with it that which drives it upwards, for the moisture is attracted into the concavity of the clepshydra. 
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its extremity into the urethra, according to what we have related in the syringe.  
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive the moisture with that which drives it; for the moisture arrives at the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a delicate enema by which the bladder is washed out. 
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or electrum: whose head is higher, similar to a small cucumber, and beneath it a groove into which a ligature may fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a ram and put into it the moisture with which you wish to irrigate the bladder. 
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two folds with a strong ligature using a double thread, and heat that moisture a little over the fire. 
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the syringe into the rod, then squeeze your hand over the bladder with the moisture with a decent constriction until the weakling feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.  
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if a bladder is not present for you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it through all its roundness. 
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes as they revolve.  
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle like a bundle of reeds is gathered: after you put into it what you wish from moistures, oils, and waters. 
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it into the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder. 
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the Extraction of a Stone. 
Caput LX.	Chapter Sixty.  
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already said in the division the species of Stone, and its treatment with medicine, and I said the difference between a Stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of it all: and I said the Stone in which the operation falls with the hand and incision: and it is a Stone generated properly in the bladder: and that which is attached to the rod, and I am narrating that with manifest exposition and abbreviation.  
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore, I say that a Stone generated in the bladder most often happens to boys. 
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs is that the urine coming forth from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, and there appears in it white sand, and the weakling rubs his rod, and labors with it, and often hangs down. 
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then he is erected, and comes forth with it the anus in many of them.  
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And healing is easy for children up to the age of fourteen. 
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly. 
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young people it is intermediate, in that which is between those things: and of the one whose stone is larger, healing is easier; and if small, it is the opposite of its care. 
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we come to healing, it is necessary first of all that we cleanse the sick person with an enema, which extracts all the dung that is in their intestines; for it sometimes hinders the discovery of the stone during examination. 
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick person be taken with their feet and shaken, and moved downwards so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or jumps from a high place several times. 
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his own hips so that the whole bladder becomes sloping downwards.  
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him externally. 
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the stone in space, then hasten immediately with an incision over it.  
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must smear the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger if he is a fully grown young man; and insert it into his anus, and inquire about the stone until it stands under your finger, and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.  
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place where you desire the incision; and instruct an assistant to press the bladder with their hand, and instruct another assistant to extend the testicles with their right hand upwards; and with their other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the incision is. 
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert an incizing speculum, whose form is this.  
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left natal: and let the incision be upon the stone itself, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision externally be wide, and internally tight, according to the quantity so that the exit of the stone from it is not greater. 
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the Stone at the incision, and it exits without difficulty.  
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from a Stone which has angles and margins, therefore its exit becomes difficult because of that. 
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy. 
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore to him who has angles and margins, add a fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	But if it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you ingeniously work upon it: or you bind it with a bandage gently, whose end is like the moon, which binds upon the stone, and does not depart from it: or that you insert beneath it a subtle instrument, of curved extremity.  
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you are not able to do so upon it, then enlarge the opening a little. 
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something overcomes you from blood, cut it off with a cautery.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if there are more than one stone, then first press the largest towards the mouth of the bladder. 
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then make an incision upon it. 
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards press a small one after that, and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	But if it is very large, then ignorance is such that you make a larger incision upon it. 
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the weak one of two things, either that he dies, or there occurs to him a continuous distillation of urine: because the place does not consolidate at all. 
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But manage its expulsion until it exits: or ingeniously work upon fracturing it with forceps, until you extract it in pieces.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it up, and put upon it a cloth infused with oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that a hot poultice may be applied. 
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then place the patient on their back upon their neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day. 
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you loosen it, embrocate the place with water and much oil. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with dyafinicon ointment, and basilicon ointment until it heals.  
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if it should happen that a hot abscess is added to the wound, and corrosions, and things similar to them: such as if blood should congeal in the bladder, and urine be prevented from flowing from it; and this is known from the discharge of blood with the urine. 
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore introduce your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood. 
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction. 
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and oppose to it every kind of thing suitable for its healing until it heals.  
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary throughout the whole course of treatment, that you bind together the two thighs and the groin, on account of the medicines which are placed upon the spot. 
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	But if the stone is small and is in the urethra, and it is fixed in it, and the passage of urine is prevented: then care for it with that which I have recounted before you come to incision. 
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Very often indeed you are excused from incision by this treatment, for I have already proved it.  
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you should take a perforator made of alferic iron, which has this shape: a triangular point, sharp, fixed in wood.  
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take thread and tie it with the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the penetrating iron into the urethra with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself; and revolve the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually; and try to perforate it, until you make it penetrate from the other side. 
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For urine is then immediately discharged. 
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the urethra. 
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it itself is broken, and exits with the urine, and the sick person is healed. 
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this cure is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it from him: then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone. 
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone in the urethra itself between the two ligatures. 
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.  
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards untie the ligature, and clean the congealed blood which is made in the wound. 
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And the ligature below the stone is not necessary unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and the other ligature above unless so that when the thread is untied after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and the wound heals together; and because of this it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, that you elevate the skin upwards so that it returns at your completion, and the wound heals together as we said. 
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Concerning the Extraction of a Stone in Women.  
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI. 
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Few stones are generated in women. 
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if it should happen to any of them a stone, then the cure is difficult, and is forbidden because of many ways. 
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin.  
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a physician when she is chaste, or among those having husbands. 
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	Thirdly, because you do not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with her hand. 
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And fourthly is the distance from the place of the stone; therefore it needs deep incision, and there is fear in that. 
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	But if necessity provokes to that, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-knowing; and few are found. 
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you deprive her of these things, then seek a chaste physician, subtle, and present a female midwife well-taught in the matter of women, or a woman who inclines towards this part of the art; therefore make her present, and especially to her, that she do all that you command her from the inquiry about the stone. 
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all it is, that she look whether the woman is a virgin; then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone. 
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, she shall constrict it under her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the weak woman, and inquire over the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder, and compresses it with good compression. 
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that gradually she move it from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts with all her strength, until it arrives with it at the root of the thigh.  
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she shall cut above it at the opposition of the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whatever part it is prepared for her, and feels the stone in that part; and her finger is not removed from the stone, constricting under it: and let the incision be small at first. 
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she shall insert a ray above that incision. 
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore she feels the stone, then let her add to the incision according to the proportion of what the stone goes out from it.  
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stone. 
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among these there is a small one and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches. 
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore know its kind, so that it may be made known to you by this concerning that which you see. 
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood overcomes you, then add ground zegi to the place, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is cut off.  
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and make sure you prepare for yourself from the instruments which I mentioned in the extraction of a stone from men so that you may be aided by them in your operation.  
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	But if the flow of blood overcomes you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which has been cut: then place powder over the place and bind it with powders in a proper binding; and do not change this; and let the stone go, and do not extract it. 
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps an infirm woman may die.  
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.  
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days and the place festers, then return to your operation until the stone comes out. 
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On the incision for watery hernia.  
Caput LXII.	Chapter LX II. 
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is nothing but a collection of moisture in the sifac alba, which is under the skin containing the testicle; and it is called sifac. 
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own groin, which nature prepared for it in the part where it swells until it appears; which is another testicle, and it is the skin of the testicle between the sifac alba, as we said; and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation indeed of this hernia is from weakness that happens to the testicles; therefore this material flows down to them.  
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles. 
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors. 
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For its color is either sloping towards yellowness, or it is bloody red, or fecal black, or it is watery white, and that is what is more. 
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where there is a gathering of water are these. 
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white sifac as we said, then the abscess is round in length a little like the shape of the letter O, and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every side.  
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own groin, then the abscess is round with a part of the letter O, and therefore a man judges that it is another egg. 
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.  
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore when you wish to know the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with a square instrument, whose form preceded.  
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that therefore which comes out in the trace of the instrument, judge concerning that which is between it.  
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, it is necessary that you advise the sick man, so that he be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body full. 
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let him be laid on his back on a high thing a little, and put many cloths under him.  
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left and order the attendant to sit at his right, who extends his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to a part of the belly cavity. 
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad scalpel and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle through the length, up to near the comb; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac comprehending it; and flay it out, and observe, or beware from this, lest you cut it: and let your flaying be from the part which hangs with the egg more; and carefully scrutinize with the flaying according to the amount that is possible for you.  
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the full bladder with a wide perforation and draw out all the water. 
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks and extend the bladder upward, and do not touch the skin enveloping the testicles; and incise the bladder in whatever way it is possible for you to incise it, either with its entirety or in parts, especially its thin side. 
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not meticulously examine it, there is no safety in its incision lest the water return.  
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the external testicle proceeds from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the bladder, return it. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with suture.  
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like other wounds until it heals. 
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if you find the testicle corrupted from blackness or another cause, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are the suspender, fearing a flow of blood. 
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspender and extract the testicle; afterwards care for it as we have said.  
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if the water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches; therefore cut off the other part according to what you did in the other equally.  
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it seems to you that the operation should be one, then do so; then wash away the blood. 
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions wool dipped in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside other wool which you have dipped in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and observe the belly; and put double cloths on top of them, and they are poultices; and bind them on top with a bandage which has six according to this form. 
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths and take them and fill them with ground carminative according to this likeness; and let the ends be pressed from the elbow or damp wool; and join them together with a bandage on the upper arms: and let one of the ends receive above the anus up to the back, and let the second receive to the part of the breastbone; and let two ends above the two thighs below, and let the other two ends above the two groins, and let the whole bandage be joined on the upper arms. 
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this wound is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a surgical cautery subtle and thin and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and it is ignited, as we have said: until when white pus appears containing water: then take a cautery, according to this shape. 
Assimilatur literae graecae.	Greek letters are assimilated. 
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce that pus with it and ignite it until all the moisture comes out. 
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the pus with hooks and flay it with a thin ignited cautery and cut it according to what is possible for you until you eradicate all of it. 
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful that the fire does not touch it.  
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer and farther from bleeding and better than the operation with an incision. 
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if it opposes you in the hour of incision, or in the hour of cautery a hot abscess, or a flow of blood, or anything else: then it is necessary that you cure what it opposes you with from it with the treatment which suits it, according to what has been said before. 
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if he is weak and timid and does not await this operation because of its horror: then perform a perforation according to what I narrate that: and it is. 
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is confirmed to you with that which we said about the meanings, that the wound is watery: then it is necessary that you make the weak person sit on a raised seat.  
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in the lower part of it with a wide speculum; and place the piercing according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water runs out. 
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a poultice on the place and bind it and let it so that the rest of the water runs out; then treat it until the wound is healed. 
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is opposition to the exit of water at the hour in which you pierce it, and this is not so except because the white subcutaneous layer makes opposition at the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of water; then it is necessary that you introduce a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which water is extracted from dropsy patients, whose form precedes; or add a little in the operation of the wound. 
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and gathers after six months, or around them. 
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	Therefore, when it gathers, then it is returned according to the same method, and the sick person will pass through his days. 
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Concerning the treatment of fleshy branches.  
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the section upon this branch, there is fear leading to destruction in many constitutions.  
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its dismissal is saving from it. 
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation upon it and the nature of an abscess.  
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in bodies, from which testicles are composed; and this happens from many causes, namely.  
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Either from acute or sharp superfluity which is poured out upon the testicles. 
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow. 
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body and pain is not found in it; and the abscess is serious. 
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess whose color is dark brown, and there is no sensation to it.  
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the nodulation of arteries and their inflation as has already preceded in its recollection; or from the inflation of veins. 
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is from them by inflation of arteries is recognized by the disposition of the abscess when you press it with your fingers. 
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary for you to touch it completely.  
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is done by the inflation of veins, nothing is dispersed from it upon compression with the fingers. 
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section be made on this type and on the other flesh; and it is to cut the skin of the testicles. 
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the testicle upward and extract it with white silk; and free the spermatic cord from the vessels and tie off the vessels; and cut the spermatic cord after you have freed it from every part of the parts of the testicle. 
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	But if the testicle is consolidated with those flesh which are born, then it behooves you to draw out the testicle and cut into it.  
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something from the spermatic cord or in that which is between the vessels: then it behooves you to free all that adhesion and cut into it with a round incision. 
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it behooves you to cut into all of it and extract the testicle as we have said. 
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then care for it with the other care until it heals. 
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Concerning the Care of Branches which are with the Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIII. 
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	A hydrocele is a swelling enclosed by a certain involution, like a hernia, with softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult movement and exercise and walking upon the weak. 
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And there is fear in the treatment of this ailment because of that of which we have previously made mention.  
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary for us to say that an operation should be done on it according to what the first ones did. 
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	Therefore I say that it is necessary for you to make the weak one sit upon a raised seat. 
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then press the spermatic cord of the testicle downward.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the veins that are near the penis; and let another attendant hold it and stretch it out with a vigorous extension. 
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a broad, sharp scalpel in a transverse section directly on the vessels, until the vessels are exposed. 
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then remove the skin from all sides, as we have told you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples. 
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix a needle into them in which there is a double thread, and tie it in the first of the places where the veins occur; and tie it again at the last of them. 
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in a straight section in the middle according to the length of the body, and extract what is collected from damp, corrupted residues. 
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the care of the other wounds, in which you wish to generate pus, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles may fall away.  
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not bad through that. 
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it should happen to a vein with all the veins, then it is necessary that the testicles along with the veins be extracted; so that the testicle may not be deprived of nourishment because of the incision and waste away, or become charred, and there may not be pleasure from them. 
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Concerning the care of branches of the intestine. 
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV. 
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The cause of this branching is from a section which occurs on the intestines extended over the belly in the part of the groin out of the region of the belly. 
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.  
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a section, or extension of it. 
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.  
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from an extension of the intestines. 
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It happens gradually over a long time and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal towards the depth: because the sifach compresses the intestine. 
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it is when it is from the section of the sifach, because it causes to happen from its beginning intense pain suddenly: and it is a different abscess, apparent under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach. 
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it exits with an intestine zircon: and this is called intestinal Ramex, and zircon: and sometimes it happens with windiness. 
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces runs into the intestine, and is retained there: and it is with this deadly danger to the sick person: because it causes severe pain to happen, and especially when it is pressed. 
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these species of illness with iron there is fear: therefore it is necessary that caution be taken in this case. 
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is, that you instruct the sick person to reduce the intestine with his hand into the interior of its cavity, if it obeys return. 
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he is laid back on his neck between your hands: and his legs are raised.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin which follows the skin above, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise. 
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to as you judge for opening the incision with them: and the incision should be according to the quantity, so that it is possible for an egg to come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the siphak, and what are under the skin of the testicles, until when the white sifach is uncovered, hard from every side: then introduce your index finger into it which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white sifach, which is under the skin, and the second sifach, and break with it the adhesion which is in the back part of the testicle.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inner skin of the testicles; and with this extend a white bandage upwards with your left hand; and raise the testicle with the bandage to the part to be cut; and instruct the assistant to extend the testicle upwards; and you loosen the adhesion that is behind after the completion of the solution. 
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers so that nothing from the intestine remains uncoiled within the hard white bandage. 
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find anything from it, then press it down towards the lower belly. 
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with a thick thread made of licorice from ten threads; and insert it at the last bandage, that is, the tunic which is under the skin of the testicles following the incision; then cut off the ends that protrude from the thread until there are four threads. 
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over others with a shape like a cross; and tie them with the bandage which we mentioned, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligament, until none of the vessels that nourish them can send anything to them: so that a hot abscess does not occur from there. 
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it by less than two fingers. 
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, let out from the bandage which is under the skin of the testicles a quantity equal to the size of a finger; and cut the rest entirely according to its roundness, and remove the testicle from it. 
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cauterize in the lower part of the skin of the testicles with an incision from which blood and pus flow; as we narrated in what has preceded. 
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound; and administer the ligature which we have narrated.  
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white bandage which we mentioned is cauterized after its incision fearing blood flow. 
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This very often happens. 
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligature, until it falls by itself. 
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its falling is delayed, then embrocate it with warm water and place upon it that which we have said, until it falls. 
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the remaining care of wounds, until it is healed. 
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning a windy branch. 
Caput LXVI.	Chapter Sixty-Six. 
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this branch, I have not seen anyone who dared to operate on it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first indeed they said that it is done as we have narrated in the branch which is with the vine. 
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is, that you should ligate the vessels after division above them with ease below: then cut in the middle and care for it finally with what opens it up, until the vessels fall: and care for the wound according to what we have said, until it is healed. 
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning a disruption which occurs in the groins.  
Caput LXVII.	Chapter Sixty-Seven. 
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is little, and returns in all hours: but if time prolongs with that, a fissure is added in the groin, until the intestines descend into the groin.  
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the groin which is in the groins, as we have said. 
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the groin is extended: then it softens and the place becomes inflamed and protrudes.  
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with a cautery, as its previous narration preceded.  
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is, that the sick person should lie on their back between your hands.  
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the inflamed and protruding place of the rupture by a width according to the measure of three fingers.  
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then bind the ligature and, what are under the skin, until a white vein is revealed, which follows it underneath the skin. 
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a needle and place it upon the prominent spot from the vein and press it deeply into the belly. 
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then mark two prominent spots above the extremity of the needle from the vein and connect them with a suture, then extract the extremity of the needle.  
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the vein at all, nor pull the testicle, or anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of hemorrhoids. 
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with wound care.  
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the threads, clean it and restore the wound until it consolidates.  
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the vein contracts and no eminence of a rupture is added. 
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to safety. 
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles. 
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII. 
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Very often the skin of the testicles is softened in certain men, on account of which the flesh between them is softened and its appearance is spoiled. 
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked in its treatment to make the sick man lie on his back and cut all the softened skin upon the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture, and if you wish, sew the excess of softened skin first with three or four sutures and make the suture firm. 
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.  
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat it with the care of other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out. 
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.  
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.  
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law and because of that it would be permitted for me not to remember it in this book of mine, and there is no need to remember it except for two ways. 
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of them is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when questioned about it, and to know its cure for whomever it happens to. 
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another way is that we often need the castration of certain animals for our own uses through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals. 
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that castration is done in two ways.  
Aut per attritionem.	Or by abrasion. 
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by fissure and incision. 
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by abrasion, the way of the operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed and hang down; then abrade them with your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear to the touch. 
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand. 
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament and cut above the whole testicle with one incision until when two testicles proceed; then incise them after you have skinned both, and do not leave anything above them except a fine silk thread which is upon the vessels. 
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by abrasion; because abrasion perhaps leaves something from the testicles, wherefore the animal desires copulation. 
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.  
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Concerning the care of a hermaphrodite in two ways. 
Caput LXX.	Chapter Seventy.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from males in two ways.  
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in it that a space follows, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine runs from that which is in the skin of the testicles. 
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one species, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubic bone just like the testicles of a man, small indeed, prominent outwardly; one of which is like the penis of a man, and two like the two testicles. 
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three species, two from men, and one species from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut away the added flesh until the impression of them escapes. 
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the care of other wounds. 
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But in the second species of men, from which urine flows, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all. 
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of a tenting and prominent flesh in the vulva of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter Seventy-One. 
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	A tenting may perhaps be added upon the natural part until its appearance becomes unsightly and foul; and sometimes it magnifies in certain women so much that it expands like in men, and reaches even to copulation.  
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore it is necessary that you hold the excess of the tenting with your hand or with a hook and make an incision; and do not stop in the incision, especially deep at the root; so that bleeding does not occur. 
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the care of other wounds until it heals. 
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the flesh that arises is flesh that is born in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it protrudes outward according to the likeness of a tail; and because of this some of the ancients call the ailment tailed. 
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that we incise it just as we incise a tenting and treat it until it heals.  
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of alratica, which is an imperforate vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter Seventy-Two.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is when the vulva of a woman is not perforated, or when there is a small opening. 
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	It is either natural or accidental. 
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	It is accidental from a preceding illness and indeed that happens either from added flesh born of the flesh, or a subtle or thick suture; and it happens either in the depth of the womb, or its sides, or its upper part, or its lower part; and it prevents coition and impregnation and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.  
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of it is gained through the examination of a midwife if nearby opilation is apparent. 
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or with a probe.  
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the opilation is from a subtle suture and is near the two labia, then hurry and break it apart. 
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is as if you should place poultices on the two labia.  
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put the index fingers of both hands together and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread apart. 
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two labia with force until the subtle suture is broken and the opilation is opened.  
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and soak it in oil and put it on the spot; and let the woman come together every day so that the place does not consolidate with other juice. 
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the suture is thick and coarse then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.  
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the opilation is from flesh born then suspend it with hooks and cut into it; and let there be with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus a mixture with albumen and egg white. 
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal quickly, let her have it for several days; and administer a licorice from dry linen, then let the rest be cured until it is healed.  
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes other flesh will be born within the womb; it is therefore necessary that they be cut according to this method: but for a cancerous abscess, as an abscess which is cancerous and within the womb, do not oppose iron at all. 
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, fistulas, and red boils in the vulvas of women. 
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter Seventy-Three. 
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of the veins, until much blood constantly flows from them. 
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Therefore, when hemorrhoids become inflamed, they turn into fistulas; and I have already said in the division of their kinds, and their signs; and I will say here which of them receive a cure, and which do not. 
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the uterus, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no cure for them with iron. 
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are from them in the opening of the uterus upon which the sense falls, are those that are cured. 
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cold house.  
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the fistulas with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots. 
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over them at the flow of blood from one of the cutting powders without modification: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and similar to them. 
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, place her in cold water. 
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	But if the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate rinds, and galls, and similar things.  
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it upon her back. 
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If, therefore, the blood is cut off with that, it is good; and if not, make the windlasses adhere to the back, and nipples, without scarification.  
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and submerge it in the juice of tamarind, or the juice of arugula, or the juice of the branches of a plant called alaul, that is, aglant, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the part. 
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when the abscess is quiet, care for the place with ointments until it heals. 
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The bartholin's gland, however, is red and resembles a rosehip and has a rough appearance. 
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that you cut out what appears from it, according to what I said about the thelil equally; and care for it until it heals. 
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the perforation of a fistula which occurs in the womb.  
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter Seventy-Fourth. 
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stone abscesses, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and hot abscesses.  
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already said all these diseases and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures in the division; it is necessary that I say in this treatise hot abscesses which occur in the womb, when they are from abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with an iron instrument. 
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary for you to consider.  
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with percussion, and burning, and fever; and you see it reddening; if numbness falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation; and care for it with that which helps towards maturation, until when the sharpness of the occurrences subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit upon a seat which has two seats, and recline, or lean upon her back, and bring together her feet to the lower part of her belly; and let her hips be spread out, and put her arms under her knees, and tie each one with a suitable ligament to it.  
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on her right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened. 
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes into those which are after. 
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with a Probe deep in the matrix of the woman: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the matrix, and injures the infirm. 
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument should be more than deep, then it is necessary that you place puluillos upon the covering of the deep matrix: so that entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the matrix is prohibited: and it is necessary that he put a verticel which runs in the instrument from the upper side; and that he hold the instrument, and that the minister turn the verticel until the deep matrix is opened. 
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	Therefore when the Exitura appears and is touched by the hand and is soft and pliable: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a wide speculum. 
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	Therefore when the blood is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place a licorice root submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the licorice, and extract the incision in the depth of the matrix. 
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally upon the matrix, and upon the comb clean wool submerged in water, in which apples have been boiled. 
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be treated after two days with an ointment suitable for it, until it heals.  
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and wound are washed, so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled: then return to the ointment. 
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	But if the wound should be hidden inside in the matrix, then it is necessary that you prohibit its cure with iron, but rather treat it with what we said in the division.  
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrine of Obstetrics, how living embryos are treated according to an unnatural figure having emerged. 
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXXV. 
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for a midwife to know first the figure of natural childbirth. 
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, by these signs it is known that when you see a woman pressing down towards her lower parts, and she desires to smell the air, and relief comes over her concerning what is upon her from childbirth, and she hastens the exit of the embryo: then know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and its exit is upon its head, and secondarily with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel. 
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore when you see these signs, it is necessary that her belly be pressed so that the embryo descends quickly.  
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon its head, the second one descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluities by a good cleansing.  
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But that which is besides this birth is unnatural, unpraiseworthy. 
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus exits upon its feet, and its body exits before its head, and its feet and its hands together, or one of its feet; or its head and hands exit; or its belly exits; and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar things from unpraiseworthy figures.  
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary for a midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception; and I am showing every figure from them, and how the mind is in it, and let it be signified by that, and let it stand upon it. 
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus exits upon its head by its natural exit, and it becomes vehement upon the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her; and vaporize the wool of her with decocted fenugreek, and with moist oils.  
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and find the second one with it, and cut it with her nail until what is in it runs out from moisture; and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends. 
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then she must be given an enema made from fenugreek mucilage and sesame oil. 
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her to compress after the enema, and make her snort when she is compressed, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. 
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will immediately come out. 
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	But if two hands of the fetus first emerge, it is necessary that you return them gradually with ease.  
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey upon entering, then place the woman upon a seat and raise her feet upward; then strike the seat upon the ground, and let the woman be held so that she does not fall at the impact. 
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	But if the hands do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them, and extract the remaining fetus; and bind his hand with cloth, and extract it equally, for he will come out. 
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	Delivery of an embryo over its feet. 
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on its own feet, it is necessary to push them upward; then gradually turn the fetus; afterwards equalize it. 
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then let him take one of its feet and extend it gradually.  
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out as far as the hips, then order her to compress and make her snort when she is compressed, for it will come out if God wills. 
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have related, then return the fetus gradually until you place it according to its natural form. 
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For then it will come out with an easy exit. 
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is prevented with all that we have related, then take fenugreek mucilage and sesame oil, and dissolved gum; and strike the whole in a mortar with good percussion; then smear it upon the vulva of the woman, and below her belly. 
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until the hypocondria follows. 
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	Therefore when you see that her lower parts are already warmed, then give her a suppository of myrrh and insert it. 
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore she has held the suppository for one hour, then make her sit upon a seat.  
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her belch and compress her mouth and nose, and press the lower part of her belly with a gentle compression. 
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.  
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The delivery of the fetus upon the knees and hands. 
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes forth according to this form, then he should gradually insert his hands.  
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should be turned onto her neck, and her feet should dangle downwards; and she herself should lie upon a bed, and intertwine her hands. 
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press upon her belly gradually. 
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then draw out what is under her feet from the cushions until she is prepared in the lower part. 
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	But if the fetus does not come forth, then take hold of her feet and move them with a forceful motion.  
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypocondria gradually until the fetus ascends to the upper parts. 
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let him insert his hands and equalize the fetus gradually; and instruct the woman to compress herself until the fetus comes forth.  
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The delivery of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands. 
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	He should apply himself to reducing his hand.  
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk. 
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then make her lie upon a bed; and strike her legs with a forceful concussion.  
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the unguent which you have prepared from gums. 
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	But if she receives her labor, then make her sit upon a seat.  
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and equalize the swelling according to the natural shape; and make the woman snore, and order her to compress herself until it comes out. 
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over its neck, with hands spread out, and its face is towards the back of its mother.  
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus, then turn it gradually, and equalize it with ease. 
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When, therefore, it is equalized, then place upon its vulva what we have described made of oil and gums.  
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order her to move gradually. 
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When therefore you have done this, then make her sit upon a seat, and order her to lean towards her right side.  
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order her to compress herself; and make her snore when it is pressed. 
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus over the side.  
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the orifice of the matrix according to this manner with the second membrane, then split the second membrane with your nail until it is evacuated from moisture. 
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If, therefore, it hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the umbilicus so that it is not retained, and dies.  
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then press the fetus towards the inside until you place it as is necessary; and order the woman to compress herself several times, for it will indeed exit by an easy way. 
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many fetuses.  
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins very often are born; and sometimes three are born, and four. 
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is extraordinary, and rarely happens.  
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five indeed is against nature and they do not live entirely; and it contains them, although they are multiplied, with one second membrane; and they are separated through a siphon, distinguishing the tied part in the umbilicus of each of them. 
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they exit as does a single fetus by natural birth, easily; and they exit by an inglorious outlet, as we have recounted. 
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	And if some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach what we said about unnatural figures, then take care of them as we have recounted; let there be a subtle midwife, and let her do what she does with ease and slowness, and let her contrive according to every figure with that which is prepared for her by wit leading to safety. 
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.  
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten; and it has already been verified by me that a woman aborting emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed. 
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which was done by the measurement of the glorious sage.  
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this ought to be in the knowledge of Obstetrics. 
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For perhaps it may happen upon her like that: let her therefore oppose him with what is necessary 
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Of the Extraction of a Dead Fetus. 
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.  
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus as I said in the division from medication, and it does not exit, and you are forced to use surgery with your hand, then it is necessary that you consider. 
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and she is not with any of the accidents from which her loss is feared: then it is necessary that the woman be laid on her back upon a bed, and let her head be inclined downwards, and let her legs be elevated; and let the attendants hold her from two sides, or let her be tied to the bed so that her body is not pulled out at the extraction of the fetus.  
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with wet oils with the mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed. 
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and gums; then let her introduce it into the womb easily. 
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her seek with it a place in which to fix hooks from the fetus, and suitable places for that.  
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head; then fix hooks into its eyes, or into its neck, or into its mouth, or into its palate, or under its beard, or into its collarbone, or into places near the ribs, and under its hypochondria.  
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is upon its feet, then into its breastbone, and its middle ribs. 
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand; and place the curvature of it in that which is between the fingers of her left hand; and introduce it with her hand easily, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have said, until it reaches an empty thing. 
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then let her fix another hook opposite it, or a third if necessary; so that there is equal contraction and it does not lean to one side. 
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let there not be extension according to straightness only, but rather let it be moved to every part so that its exit is relieved; just as it is done when a tooth is eradicated. 
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that which is between it, that the extension be softened. 
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	And if a part is retained from it, then the midwife must anoint some fingers with oil and introduce them from the side, so that she revolves what is retained with them. 
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If then a part of the fetus goes out, then let the hooks be changed to another place which is higher; do this until the whole fetus comes out. 
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If then a hand goes out before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction; then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it. 
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until the whole thing comes out, cut it either at the junction of the sole or at the elbow; and thus you must do it on one hand and on both feet. 
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the head of the fetus is large, or constriction occurs at its exit, or there is water collected in its head: then it is necessary that you insert a Spatumile with spines between your fingers and bore through the head with it and extract the water; or break it up with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which follows. 
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Do the same if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then you must cut through the algengematu: or extract it with a misdach, as we have said. 
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw out the bones with forceps. 
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	But if the head comes out, and is constricted at the fork: then bore it, until the moisture which is in the chest is poured out. 
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it does not become entangled, nor yield to coming out: then cut the head into pieces as much as is possible for you. 
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	But if there is an abscess below the belly, or there is dropsy in it: then you must pierce it until the moisture runs out of it. 
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is on its feet, then its attraction is easy and its direction to the mouth of the womb is slight.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it becomes constricted at the belly or chest: then you must pull it out with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and bore the belly or chest until what is in them runs out. 
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the remaining limbs are taken away and the head returns: then let the midwife introduce her left hand. 
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	Therefore if the mouth of the womb is open, let her introduce her hand deep into the womb and seek the head with it and draw it up to the mouth of the womb with her fingers: then let her insert one hook or two hooks in it and draw it out with them. 
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mouth of the uterus is constricted due to a hot abscess which has occurred in it: then it is not necessary for him to labor over it, rather he ought then to administer an effusion of humid and fatty things, and apply poultices, and sit in waters which soften and moisten. 
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it may be equalized; then let what we said about the living fetus be administered. 
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it shall be cut into pieces and extracted. 
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you not leave anything from the placenta inside at all.  
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	Therefore when you have completed your operation then administer what we said about hot abscesses which occur in uteruses. 
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood should occur, then let her descend into astringent waters and administer the remaining care.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have indeed already seen a woman, in whose belly a fetus had died; then she became pregnant again with another, afterward that fetus also died. 
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	It therefore happened to her after a long time that an abscess formed in her navel, and it swelled up until it opened and began to discharge pus. 
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called for her care and treated her for a long time; and the wound did not heal. 
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I therefore put on it some poultices of strong attraction, and a mouth came out of the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed for her, and another mouth came out. 
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I therefore wondered from that point, since there was no mouth in her belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus. 
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore inquired into the wound and extracted many bones, with the woman being in better dispositions; and she has now lived thus for a long time, and sends out little pus from the place. 
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not include this here as something foreign unless because there is knowledge in it and help for that which the craftsman physician administers with his hand from healing. 
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the Forms of Instruments Necessary in the Extraction of a Fetus
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII. 
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of a Strictor, as it is found in the books, to which two whorls are equally fitted at the ends of two pieces of wood.  
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, these whorls ought to be more delicate than the rest of the Strictor and they should be made either from ebony or boxwood. 
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of all the wood should be about two fingers, and the edge of each of the two is about one finger wide, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers or a little more.  
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the uterus so that it opens with them when you turn the two whorls.  
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of a Whorl by which the uterus is opened. 
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, more delicate and lighter.  
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made of ebony or boxwood wood, according to the likeness of forceps.   
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there should be two additions, as you see here above; and the length of each addition from them is about a palm; and the width of each is two fingers. 
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	Therefore, when you wish to open the uterus with it, then have the woman sit on a bed with her feet dangling, opening what is between her thighs.  
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two joined additions into the uterus; and you hold the lower part of the instrument between her thighs. 
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with an instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount which you wish from the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants. 
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of another Vertigo than the ancients said The Compelling Form by which the fetus is impelled.  
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, by which a large head is pressed, and it is assimilated to forceps, which have teeth at the extremity, as you see. 
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oblong, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it is cut and pressed. 
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac by which a small head is pressed.  
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of Uncini having one spine. 
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of Uncini having two spines. 
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps which have saw teeth, with which a fetal head is pressed.  
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of Spatula having two extremities for cutting off the head. 
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two Spatulas also spread apart.   
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are exercised, and the more their kinds are multiplied and they are prepared by a craftsman, the quicker they are for their operation, and the higher they are esteemed among men, because of their quantity. 
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not despise any instrument from them, but have it prepared by you.  
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For the necessity of them is inexcusable. 
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Concerning the Extraction of a Second Child. 
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78. 
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When a second child is retained during labor, then it is necessary that you instruct the weak woman to retain her breath. 
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then have her groan when she is strained; and compress your hand over her mouth and nostrils.  
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it exits through this, it is good. 
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot and perforate a hole in the lid; and place herbs which open the mouth of the matrix therein, such as calamus, rue, anise, chamomile, dill, cassia lignea, and centaury; take all these herbs or some of them, and submerge them with water, and place them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed tube over the hole of the crucible pot, and the other end into the mouth of the mold; and hold it until the vapor reaches the concavity of the mold. 
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it snort, as we said. 
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For then it will come out easily. 
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then order the midwife to submerge her hand in oil of sesame, or hollyhock mucilage. 
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then let her introduce it into the vulva and seek the secundina with it. 
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she has found it, then let her take hold of it and gradually extend it. 
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deep within the mold, then let her introduce her hand, as we have described, until she finds the secundina and gradually extracts it according to its straightness so that the mold does not fall due to strong attraction; indeed, it must be shifted with ease to the right and left sides: then add to the amount of attraction. 
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it then obeys and is preserved and comes loose from its adhesion.  
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	But if the mouth of the mold is constricted, as we have already said: treat it with snorting and from the pot's medication with herbs.  
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out with all that we have said, then be careful not to tire yourself in the repetition of the extraction. 
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that what comes out from its mouth bind it to the woman's thigh.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then give her an enema with tetrapharmacon ointment. 
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will rot it after a few days and dissolve and come out. 
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it rots, a bad smell rises from it to the stomach and head and harms a weak person. 
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, it is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered for this.  
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some ancients, however, have already tried fumigation with watercress and dried figs. 
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated during the retention of secundines and menses. 
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of glass like an alembic, or of lead; and let the wide end be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be placed on top of prunes; let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and repeat another. 
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the treatment of an unperforated anus. 
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX. 
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with their anuses unperforated, which have already been sealed by a delicate suture.  
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife must perforate it with her finger; and if not, she must perforate it with a sharp spatulum; and let her beware that the laceration does not touch it. 
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on top of it.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then heal it with ointments until it is healed. 
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you are afraid that it will be sealed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days and remove it when the boy wants to defecate. 
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it sometimes happens that the anus is also sealed from the consolidation of a wound or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it must be cut and then treated with what we have said from its treatment and lead. 
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.  
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX. 
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodulations and swellings that occur near the anus externally; or in the space of one part; and there is one fistula, or several. 
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that nodulation becomes old, it opens, and watery moisture, white or thin pus, flows from it.  
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore penetrating wounds are recognized by what comes out through the discharge, and flatulence, when the weak person uses the discharge; and perhaps a worm may come out of them. 
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And fistulas are from them when they are penetrating to the bladder, and as far as the urethra.  
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating as far as the hip joint, and as far as the tailbone. 
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	But by which a penetrating fistula to the anus is known, also from a non-penetrating one, is that you insert your index finger into the anus; and insert a slender probe into the fistula from metal, or iron: when there is no crookedness. 
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	But if there is crookedness in it, then insert into it a slender probe from lead, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe, or hair on your finger.  
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	But if you do not feel it thoroughly, nor does anything come out of the orifice from discharge, nor flatulence, nor a worm as I said; then know that it is non-penetrating: hurry therefore to treatment. 
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating to the bladder, or to the urethra; then its indication is urine exiting from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place may consolidate with medicines. 
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is penetrating as far as the hip joint, or to the acetabulum; then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no crookedness in it as far as the opening; and the discovery of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always comes out from it; and that medication does not work on it, nor does it consolidate with ointment. 
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and the treatment of them is toil and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is performed. 
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating, and not old, healing is hoped for with a cautery; according to what I tell you, and I have already proven it; and it is that the weak person lie between your hands on his back; and raise his legs up to above his hips, and let his hips be inclined toward his belly. 
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a probe of lead, or air, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches. 
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if he feels it weak around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus. 
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	Therefore, if you feel the probe has already penetrated through itself, beyond which you feel between your finger and it, or flesh; then you will know for certain that it is penetrating; therefore do not labor in it, because it is not its cure, as we have said.  
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, they said that the flesh is healed in some men, and from the medication from which help is expected, it is, to ignite a subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as preceded, and insert it ignited into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.  
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice, or three times, until you know that all those added filtered flesh, which are similar to a bird's quill, have already been burned. 
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with linens wrapped in butter until those burned flesh come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate. 
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	Therefore if it heals, it is good.  
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it never heals with any other treatment. 
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or sifac between it and the probe: and you see the fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will cut with the probe what is in the fistula until the cutting reaches where the extremity of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls.  
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh which are assimilated to a bird's quill so that nothing remains from them. 
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If blood, however, overcomes you and dissolves the connection between you and your operation so that you cut those flesh parts: then it is better to do what is swifter and more helpful, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine. 
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because cautery with fire brings together good qualities, burning of those added flesh parts, cessation of blood, and drying of humors. 
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it by wrapping it with linen soaked in butter or with crushed stalks until the place discharges pus and those burnt flesh parts go forth into the pus. 
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for that wound with hardening ointments, producing hard flesh; and there are medicines in which are astringency and drying.  
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then they are already healed, and you need not fear repetition. 
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already reached as far as the depth of the anus and is elongated by excess body: then insert your finger into the anus and inquire with it. 
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a test and between you and it there is a veil of linen or flesh and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation upon that except according to the way of trust and hope. 
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is because one of three ways is administered upon it, either to cauterize it itself as we said or to cut it until you reach its cavity so that it is possible for you to insert linen and healing from next to it.  
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cutting so that you do not fall into the muscle containing the anus and it happens upon a weak outcome of evacuation without will.  
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for it as we said. 
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed or you lengthen the veil and clean it after you have dried it close to the anus as we said either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp extremity. 
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filtered flesh parts which are in the incision, as far as you can with careful examination. 
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try the restoration of the whole wound with the incision and the upper opening where it is consolidated; and a fistula will remain open on the inside part near the anus, and it will be easier for the sick person. 
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula is made in this way; and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula, which is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an awl, that is, prepared leather, according to this form. 
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wrapped from five threads or so. 
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.  
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it is penetrating into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then draw out the thread from that hole: so that you insert your finger into the anus and draw out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and tighten both, and leave it for one day or two days: and the more the thread falls into the flesh, tighten it well until those pieces of flesh between the two ends of the thread fall off; then care for the wound until it is consolidated and healed. 
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate by any means that is prepared for you, unless it is very deep. 
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not fitting for you to do that because of tearing, so that you do not fall into it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we said until it is healed. 
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The form of a sharp-pointed speculum with which the fistula is divided, whose curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp so that it does not fall into what is not necessary as you see. 
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision; and care for fissures. 
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter Eighty-One. 
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids according to two types. 
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For they are either within the anus, like bladders of charcoal or prunes; or as if they themselves are grains of a pomegranate. 
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small ones, and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and is one, and are many. 
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But those which are outside the anus are according to most few in moisture, from which runs watery fluid, or a little blood with constant flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is within the anus, is that you order the sick person to strain; and it should be squeezed until the anus protrudes, and hemorrhoids appear to you.  
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore suspend them with hooks; or hold them with your fingernail. 
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut into them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if hooks do not hold them because of their moisture and softness; then take them with a rough cloth or a swab from double wool, and pull them out with your fingers. 
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut into them, and sprinkle over them after the incision certain hot powders so that they will serve as a cautery for them. 
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the remaining treatment until they are healed. 
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	But if the anus does not yield to protrusion, then give the sick person an enema in which there is a little mordant, so that it washes with what is in the anus, and yields to protrusion quickly when the sick person strains.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if hemorrhoids are external from the anus, then their matter is light, easy; and it is as you take them with your fingernail or take them with a hook, and cut into them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we have said until they are healed. 
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever recoils from cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer a suture to them according to this method. 
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take an unraveled thread and insert it into the needle. 
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the thread upwards through the needle and make it penetrate with the point at its root on one side; and wind the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle so that they are parallel to each other, and tighten the thread firmly with a strong knot. 
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie off the thread and remove the needle. 
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the threads and leave one of them untied, so that excess blood may run from it.  
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or carrot oil on top of the wound and put it over the area; and instruct the patient to rest. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave him until it falls off. 
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the threads fall off, care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they are healed.  
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the Treatment of Fissures. 
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Very often they occur from drying of excrement and constriction of nature.  
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	Therefore when they become chronic and medicine is not effective in them; then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a scalpel or with your fingernail until they become moist, and remove the top layer which prevents them from consolidating. 
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they consolidate as is necessary.  
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not consolidate; then repeat them with a more vigorous scraping than the first until they bleed profusely and are flayed; then care for them until they are healed.  
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids, Both Inverted and Non-Inverted, and Threads, as Well as Ants. 
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter Eighty-Two.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that a hemorrhoid is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail; and it occurs throughout the entire body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and pain results from them upon walking. 
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it must be cut what is around the clavicle, and held with forceps or a hook, and eradicated from its root. 
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.  
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From the ash-tree however there is one small eminence, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body. 
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And it often happens in the hands of children. 
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the treatment for it is, to extend the ash tree and cut it; or tie it with silk thread; or with a hair until it falls off. 
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously mentioned with fire or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted ash trees are eradicated, and non-inverted ones with the instrument which I will say.  
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	An ant however is also a small eminence, filtered, thick, above the surface of the body, extending deep; and when it finds cold, it feels like an ant bite therein, and this happens throughout the whole body; and most of it occurs in the hands. 
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is, to take a cannula from a goose feather, or a vulture quill strong; and place that cannula upon the ant, until the circle of the cannula contains its parts. 
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then revolve your hand with the cannula until you cut what is around the ant; and place it deep into the flesh and eradicate the ant from its root. 
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with an air or iron cannula, according to this form.  
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the cannula be a loose winding, drawing upwards, so that the apprehension thereof and its revolution is relieved upon the finger. 
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was previously mentioned in the cauterization of the ash tree in the chapter on cautery. 
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the forms of instruments which are used for fistulas in diseases of the anus, and rupture of the abdomen, and colic. 
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter Eighty-Three. 
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast bronze, or hammered bronze. 
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made of these instruments small and large, according to those in which they are administered.  
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered in the healing of very young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak, or painful, so also their enemas.  
Clistere magnum.	A large enema. 
Cistere paruum.	A small enema. 
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tube of it, that is, the upper head in which the bladder is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and let there be a distinction so that the bladder is tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, smooth, very slender, drawing toward subtlety; and on one of its sides there shall be two holes, and on the other side one hole. 
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be from the bladder of an animal; or from sheepskin parchment, which shall be according to the form of a small wineskin: the root of which shall be one palm. 
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let it be pierced with many holes as it is revolved, and the space which is between every hole shall be the thickness of a finger.  
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, which shall be from ten threads or about that, and combine it with a bladder like that of a wineskin. 
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the bladder is placed in it, tighten at the head of the enema between two distinctions with a strong constriction.  
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then administer the enema with it. 
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle of bladders here depicted, and the holes. 
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of giving an enema with it is to fill a syringe or bladder with medicine that has been warmed according to the amount the sick person can tolerate; and be careful that it is not very hot nor very cold. 
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick person is laid on their back and raises their legs upwards; and put something under them, that is, leather on which people lie, or a sheet. 
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then smear the end of the enema with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or something similar. 
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then gently insert it into the anus. 
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant hold the syringe with both hands at the same time and squeeze it vigorously until all that is in the enema is emptied into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the enema and let the sick person raise their legs up to the wall. 
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine compels them to defecate, then let them hold it as long as they can.  
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if they sleep with it all night, it is best for healing. 
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you give an enema to someone with abdominal swelling and they rush to defecate, then repeat the enema until they are healed. 
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	But if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the enema be very mild and gentle, like the enemas given to children.  
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a delicate enema for when the skin is tight. 
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the Treatment of Head Wounds Without Bone Fracture.  
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 84. 
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds what was fitting for the book, and I will say here the treatment of them with the hand and with medicines according to complement.  
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what causes the wound and according to the place on which the wound falls. 
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the things by which wounds are often made are like the throwing of a stone: or a cut with a sword, or knife; or a percussion with a spear, or wood, or arrow; and similar things from many objects. 
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds which are made according to the locations of the body are, such as a wound which falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or thigh; and similar ones from those limbs. 
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am stating the cures of some wounds, so that I may put that reasoning and rule over the other wounds. 
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds; because the recollection of complex ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter. 
Dico ergo.	Therefore, I say. 
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no bone fracture; then consider if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and has already broken only the skin: and the wound is large, and you fear for an unfavorable outcome of hot abscesses; then hurry and perform cephalic phlebotomy immediately; and do not delay it; and extract blood from him according to the amount of his strength: if there is nothing prohibiting phlebotomy, especially if the blood that comes out from the wound is little. 
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.  
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware of overeating, and wine, and heavy foods. 
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if something prohibits reduction, then let him reduce from food, and not approach meats, nor wines. 
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place upon the wound, if a hot abscess happens to him, cotton infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.  
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are safe from a hot abscess, then place upon the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and the air has not yet changed it, powder which I will state later a little: and if the air has already changed it, then place some ointments upon it until it heals. 
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or is from a cut by a sword, and similar instruments, and its edges do not come together by themselves, then bring them together with suture, as I shall explain concerning wounds of the belly. 
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound is already separated from the bone, and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except by a small suspensory bandage: then cut it. 
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines and restore hard flesh in place of the skin, and instruct the patient to eat foods which are nourishing, such as meat and cooked wheat, until he is fat; and those similar. 
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	But if you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out all the putrefaction and discard it; then treat that area.  
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it is not stopped by medicines, then examine the artery above. 
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it uncut, then cut it with a scalpel or tie it off.  
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if necessity compels when that which we have said does not work, then burn it until the blood is stopped. 
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy and light so that you sprinkle this powder over them: because it hardens them before the air changes them. 
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of Making Flesh-Colored Powder
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part frankincense and two parts dragon's blood and three parts unquenched lime; grind the whole thoroughly and sift it. Fill the wound with this powder and constrict it well with a bandage until it adheres firmly to it and coagulates with the blood.  
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it over with bandages and leave it alone; do not unbind it until it remains so that it does not fester.  
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For it is not eradicated by medicine until it is healed. 
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes lime alone does this when you do not have frankincense at hand, and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many large wounds when it is fitting to place it upon them and bind, and they are recent wounds with their own blood which has not been altered by air. 
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if it has already been altered by air, especially when it is in the summertime, then this powder is not intended for use; therefore treat it with what we said so that you place certain digestive ointments upon them; or place poultices of barley flour made with water and honey upon them until they discharge pus. 
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining care until they are healed. 
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	But if it should happen that there is a fracture in the bone with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with forceps; and I will now speak of the treatment of skull fractures in what is to come. 
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Concerning wounds of the neck. 
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter Eighty-Five. 
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	But if a wound should happen in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment and that of a head wound when it is simple. 
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if a nerve or artery of the neck has already been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to apply treatment that produces strong astringency, such as alum, and za'faran, and those similar to them. 
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they are harmful to nerves and contract them. 
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold at all upon the wound; because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most exalted of the members; and let that with which it is treated be from mild medicines, such as lime slaked with fresh water repeatedly infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty when it is washed even with fresh water: and the remaining mineral stones, in this manner, and humid ointments. 
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then apply a suture; or bring together its lips with poultices. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus has already collected, then perforate it in a more depressed place within it. 
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	And if an artery has already been cut in the wound and its flow of blood has followed; then separate or dry it and bind it; or cauterize it if necessity compels it. 
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the spine of the throat has already fallen, or all of it, and its ligaments are saved; then join the lips of the skin with a suture over the trachea, and do not touch the throat, rather equalize it, and reduce it to its natural form. 
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a decent constriction, and let it go for several days. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments in which there is astringency and desiccation until it heals. 
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it; then if there are bone fragments in it, extract all of them, or as many as you can from them; and what is not prepared, leave it until the wound putrifies, and separates and its egress alleviates.  
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	But if the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder which I have described upon it. 
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if bone appears to be seen in the wound, and a fistula is formed; then care for it with that of which mention comes in its chapter.  
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Concerning a Wound on the Shoulder Blades
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter Eighty-Six. 
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a thrust by a spear or knife; and you see its depth, then consider. 
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	Therefore if windiness comes forth from the wound when a weak person breathes from it, then you will know that the wound is mortal.  
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder on it in the first hour, nor bind it up, so that the blood may not be retained in its depth and return to the heart and kill the sick person: but put an attractive ointment on it and dissolve it twice a day. 
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if you do not have ointment present, then put an old rag in the wound opening so that it may draw out what flows from it of moistures; and make the sick person sleep upon the wound so that what collects in it may run. 
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if three or more days have already passed since the wound and no spasm occurs to the sick person, nor evil trembling of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see that his other dispositions are good: then know that the wound is healed.  
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore care for it with washes and the rest of its treatment until it heals. 
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	But if its healing is excused and it is always opened up, then know that a fistula has already been made. 
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore care for it from its own chapter.  
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if a wound is from the incision of a sword or knife and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then care for it with what preceded from suture if it is large; or with powder if it is small. 
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone and chips come from it, then probe the wound and hurry to extract those chips if they are separate. 
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separate, then leave them until the wound rots; for their extraction is relieved then.  
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But judgment in the treatment of other accidental wounds in other limbs is the judgment that we said.  
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Of wounds of the belly and the exits of intestines and their outlets. 
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	Disruption which happens to the abdomen is great, and medium, and small. 
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great one therefore sometimes an intestine, or a number of intestines, comes out.  
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore the introduction of them is made, and their suture more vehement and difficult. 
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also becomes difficult in another way.  
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows therefore that the reduction of them is more difficult if you do not hurry in their introduction to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and enlarged: therefore its entry becomes difficult. 
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Because of this, therefore a medium disruption is better: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it becomes difficult in these two kinds.  
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of a vein is according to four methods. 
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common and apply to the suture of the abdomen, and to the suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly pertain to the remaining wounds. 
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However they are more proper with the suture of the abdomen: and I will tell you each one with explanation and declaration. 
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore that when a wound is small, and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is because of one of two methods.  
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: Or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the cold of the air. 
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	Therefore when it is so, it is necessary that you warm it, so that you immerse a sponge, or cloth dampened in lukewarm water only.  
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you boil in water squints and cypress and saffron and embrace it with the intestine until inflation is resolved.  
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine in which there is astringency makes it: and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflation. 
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the swelling already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which has been boiled marshmallow or mallow. 
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through that its entry is eased with a small thing. 
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the disruption with an instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut. 
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when prepared than a section: and there is no compulsion to cut after necessity and defect of the instrument.  
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted and pointed, and the other part not pointed, and let the fine end not be with the fineness of a spatula, but rather be a little blunter: and it is that which resembles a chisel, as you see. 
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its own natural form in its proper place if possible above it; for it is better. 
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	But when the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on its back, and put their legs higher than their head. 
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then put its head and chest higher than its lower parts. 
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your attention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part. 
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds and in medium wounds.  
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, put it according to what is prepared for you. 
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make a pious minister be present between your hands who will hold the whole disruption with his hand: and join its lips. 
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it for him who follows a suture something after something: and this is the manner of a common single suture. 
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And take a needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. 
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let fall from the end of the disruption a quantity equal to the breadth of the ring finger, that is, a physician's breadth; and fix one needle beyond which you shall introduce a thread into both extremities of the skin, with both extremities of the sifac which is under the skin, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the sifac: and there are four rows. 
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then bind with a double thread around the needle several times on both sides at once, until the two lips of the wound are joined together in a decent manner.  
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let fall a quantity equal to the breadth of a finger, and fix another needle in them; then draw it tight with thread, just as you did with the first needle.  
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do that with as many needles as you need until you complete the constriction of the whole wound. 
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be of medium size between thinness and thickness; because very thin needles pierce the flesh quickly, and thick ones have a difficult entry into the skin; therefore it is necessary that they are of medium thinness and thickness.  
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in the two extremities of the skin very close together; lest the flesh be pierced quickly and the wound opened before its healing, and lest they also be lengthened with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from healing. 
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the sick man during his sleep; and put little wads of cloth on all sides to hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed. 
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this indeed, a species of suture with needles thus arranged, is more suitable for small wounds.  
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one, or two, or about that number of needles suffice in the suturing of them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second suture is common, so that you bring together the extremities of four with a suture: two extremities of skin and two extremities of fascia in one stitch, with a needle which has thread wound equally fine and thick. 
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced these four extremities with the needle, draw back the needle from the part where you began, so that the drawn thread may fall from the upper part of the wound: let the suture be like the suture of cloth whereby cloths are tied, and put between every suture a quantity equal to the thickness of the little finger.  
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	But men know this suture. 
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I healed a wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife and the disruption of the wound was greater than a palm; and about two palms had come out from the intestines from the middle intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the belly. 
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I therefore returned it after his intestines had stood outside the wound for twenty-four hours.  
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound therefore became consolidated in the space of about fifteen days; and I cared for it and it was healed; and he lived afterward for many years, returning to his usual ways. 
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed. 
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a marvel that I did not treat it with ointment.  
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where ointment was not to be found, nor anything of medicine.  
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore put old linen upon the wound twice a day and constantly washed it with honey water until it was healed. 
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	But I will tell two kinds of sutures proper according to the telling of speech.  
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture; and insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle has penetrated the skin and gone into the muscle following the length and breadth of the whole body: let the extremity of the fascia fall on the side in which you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate into the other extremity from the inner part to the outer part at the other extremity. 
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate thus in the same extremity from the outer part to the inner: and let go the sifac extremity which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other extremity from the inner part to the outer; and make it penetrate with the penetration that you make it penetrate into the sifac extremity which is in its part until it penetrates into the whole. 
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from the same side and with its extremity which is from the sifac on the other side, and draw out the needle from the skin that it penetrated. 
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then return it into that skin and its sifac extremity which is on the other side with this mirach extremity; and draw it out from the skin which is from its part, and do this alternately one by one, and another; and do this alternately after another until you have extracted all of its extrinsic parts according to that example. 
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that its sutures be like those of skin layers; so that its sifac be alternately on one side with one extremity of skin; and that you let it go alternately on the other side, until you complete it. 
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of suture proper which Gale said. 
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech of his is narrated so that its suture be according to the likeness which some physicians make, so that they bring together every part to its corresponding fellow according to nature; and apply the sifac extremity to its other extremity, and the mirach extremity to its other extremity. 
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I tell you. 
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you fix the needle in the mirach extremity nearest to you from the outer part and make it penetrate to the inner in that alone; and let go the two sifac extremities. 
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner in the two sifac extremities, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both [instruments] over and make them penetrate from the inside to the outside, at two extremities of a pair of other forceps, which are on the opposite side. 
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is a suture of which remembrance preceded. 
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also the speech of Galen. 
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said. 
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is corrected with two needles.  
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which is, to insert one thread into both of them; and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is at your side, and make it penetrate up to the other side, according to the suture of those who are leather equally.  
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than that of the remaining parts of the belly. 
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment indeed of the medication of a wound, is the judgment of other wounds.  
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which is, because when you attain a fresh wound with its own blood, before the air alters it; and you reduce the intestine, and its own, and fit it; then place powder of incarnating on top. 
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it certain ointments which are present to you, until they make pus; and the threads fall away, and the sutures consolidate, and heal. 
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as is the care of other wounds, until it is healed. 
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if medicines are not present to you, then place on it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old lint; and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.  
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need another medication in many dispositions, when wounds are simple. 
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound may communicate to the principal members in injury, then it is necessary that you immerse soft wool in oil of tempered warmth, or in rose oil; and place it around the parts which are between the groins, and under the armpits. 
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or pricks, or putrefaction in his bowels (for this often happens) then give him an enema with strong black wine, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and is about to penetrate as far as its cavity. 
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and what is from them out of the subtle, more difficult to heal. 
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called Jejunum does not admit healing from a wound that happens in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the nearness of its nature to nerves.  
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the wound is a protuberance, and you overtake it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce intestines equally. 
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if a space has passed it, and it has already become green or black: then it is necessary that you constrict it with thread above the place which has been blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not happen. 
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in a protuberance are veins and arteries.  
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that relief comes upon you from its attraction, and extraction of it in case of a protuberance, and emission of pus from the wound. 
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A Reminder of a Wound That Happens in the Intestine. 
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture happens in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it may be restored in some men: therefore because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a thrust of a lance, and the wound was from the right side of the stomach, and the wound became old: and a fistula was made, and there issued forth from it discharge, and flatulence. 
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I applied treatment until I was no longer anxious about its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until it was healed and the site consolidated. 
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the site already consolidated, I feared for the patient, that some bad accident might befall him in his abdomen; and no such bad accident befell him from then on. 
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and defecating, and entering the bath, and exercising himself in his diet. 
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And already some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small, then it ought to be tied according to this method. 
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you take ants of large heads.  
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant from those which have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.  
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore its head is on them and it bites down with its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere and not be released.  
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease doing this with an ant after an ant according to the total quantity of the wound. 
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and its wound.  
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads will remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm befall the patient deeply. 
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And already it is possible that the intestine may be tied even with a fine thread; which has been drawn out from the intestine of an animal, attached to it after it is inserted into a needle. 
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it should be scraped off very much.  
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie at its end a fine thread of flax wrapped around it. 
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into a needle and with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then put it back into its separation. 
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with ants and intestines is not except according to the way of trust and hope. 
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines: then there is no remedy except refinement, and its healing is not at all. 
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the Care of Fistulas and Zuchemen. 
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter Eighty-Eight.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound or abscess when it grows old and becomes ancient, and becomes an ulcer and does not consolidate, and always discharges pus and is not cut off: then it is universally called a fistula, wherever it may be in the limb; and we call it Zuchemen. 
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula indeed is according to truth a filtered knot, hard, white: with which there is no pain and which has the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather. 
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is sometimes moist in certain hours, which discharges pus. 
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture splits in certain hours.  
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little: and it is thick, and sometimes thin. 
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I already stated previously in the division when I said wounds that every sore which does not heal and flesh is not born in it, it is not except because of one of nine new causes. 
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the lack of blood in the body; or because of its malice; or because there is tough flesh between it and its upper lips, preventing the birth of flesh; or because there is much filth and squalor; or because the sore itself is putrid, and the material sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inconvenient in its healing; or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence; or through a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which digestion of illnesses is difficult and healing of abscesses by nature is delayed; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones in it. 
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have now shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in division; and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by the way of operation with the hand. 
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore, know that Fistula occurs in all members of the body. 
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them are Fistulas which reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints composed in composition: such as the hand, and foot; and from them are those which go to the proximity of the principal member, and similar ones.  
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which therefore of these Fistulas is according to this manner, is from illnesses difficult of healing, and does not receive healing, and occupation with it is toil and ignorance.  
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if it is from Fistulas some of whose depth does not reach these places which I said: and you hope, and trust in its healing, and wish to arrive at the knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the Fistula extends according to straightness, and explore it with it. 
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is crookedness in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.  
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, with the gentleness of its body, is relieved, and curves around the crookedness. 
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	But if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate upon it with a probe.  
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore wash out one of the openings from its openings. 
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you wash it, goes towards the other openings, and runs out from them.  
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire according to which manner it is possible for you: that you may know whether there is a bone, or nerve, and the Fistula's cavity is distant, or near: or whether the Fistula is one which has many openings, and stand over all of it, with your greatest strength: with questioning of yours, with which you question the sick person, and finding pain at compression with your hand upon the place, and similar things from signs and causes arising as an abscess. 
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when you have stood upon all that true station, then go to the cure according to confidence: and it is, that you consider then, if there is a Fistula nearby apparent, or in a safe place far from the joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you: then cut the Fistula according to what was stated from my narration, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh, which arises in its orifice from flesh, or thelul, and similar things: and cure it, until it is healed. 
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the Fistula is of distant depth, and is according to straightness: then it is necessary that you cut it deeply as much as is possible for you. 
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then clean it from all its corrupted flesh. 
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply linen wrapped in sharp medicines: and insert it up to the cavity of the Fistula which you comprehended with iron: do this several times with it until the sharp medicine eats away all that remains in the cavity of the Fistula from corruption. 
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed. 
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we narrated. 
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	But if the cause of the Fistula is a bone, and it is certified to you: then inquire about it, and cut it according to what I narrated to you: if nothing prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we said. 
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore the bone is revealed to you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it, until all its corruption is removed. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with what makes it flesh again, until it is healed.  
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	But if it does not heal and emits pus as it was doing: then know that you have not reached the total eradication of corruption. 
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore uncover it a second time and make a careful incision into it, and cleanse it with your greatest care. 
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it. 
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If then it heals, it is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached. 
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore there is no skill for you in it except to leave it to nature.  
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	But if the mouth of a young child is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for it. 
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then carefully draw them all out, and do not leave any of them with your strength. 
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	But if something opposes you from the humors and there is no fear or mistake in their incision; then cut into those humors and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones. 
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	But if you are not prepared to remove the bones in your time, then place over the wound something that will cause it to rot; and leave it until what is around those bones rots from flesh and humors. 
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And watch the wound so that it does not solidify. 
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the section which you cut in your operation.  
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Rather place over it, if you fear, a cloth immersed in sulfur ground with oil; or a cloth immersed in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointments. 
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humors rot and separate from the bones, their removal is eased and their attraction. 
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or hip bone, and similar to them, and what is corrupted from it is a large part; then scrape it with the last incision until that blackness and corruption is removed. 
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound. 
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is corrupted in it is a large part and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then you must saw it and cut it entirely up to the place where the corruption reaches; then care for it until it heals together. 
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you a story that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take it as an example and help for your operation. 
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man about thirty years old, to whom came pain in his leg, from a cause which moved within him, that is, from his insides, until the materials reached his leg, and there formed a large abscess: and he had no external cause. 
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Time was extended with him in error of the physicians until the abscess was opened and many materials flowed forth with it. 
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was postponed until his leg became fistulous and many openings were made in it, which all emitted pus and the humors of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	A multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one wise in the art of the hand among them, until I was called and I saw his leg and the materials which flowed from those openings with great force: even his whole body had already wasted away, and his color was citron. 
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore I inserted a probe into one of the openings and it reached the bone. 
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I scrutinized all the openings, and I found that they reached one another from all parts of the leg. 
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I hastened and cut above one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone; and I found it corrupted: which had already been corroded, blackened, putrefied, and perforated until it penetrated to the marrow. 
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Therefore I sawed away what was revealed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone. 
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption which I cut away and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And now I had rooted it out. 
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.  
Et non est consolidatum.	And it did not consolidate. 
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed and found above the bone a second opening above the first discovery; and I found continuous corruption with the bone, and I sawed what appeared to me also from that corruption. 
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried its restoration. 
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored. 
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore I detected above it again and did not cease to cut the bone in sections and try its restoration; and it was not restored until I cut about a palm from the bone and extracted it with its marrow. 
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines and it was quickly consolidated and healed; and this iteration was not necessary in its operation and section except because of the weakness of the infirm person's condition, and his lack of endurance, and my fear for him concerning death: because he suffered from evil syncopes due to excess evacuation every hour. 
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore healed with complete healing and firm flesh grew in the place of the bone; and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned; and he returned to his former condition, and did not cause him any hindrance in walking. 
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the prominent bone in the place of the body is already broken then it is necessary that you saw it according to this method: and it is as follows: take a bandage and bind it at the extremity of the prominent bone; and order someone to extend it upwards and put another bandage of thick wool upon the first bandage. 
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it above the flesh which is under the bone and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh downwards; and you expose the flesh above the place which you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh. 
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a board under the lower bone perpendicularly; because when you do this it is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the saw be above the corrupted place for a short time so that there is no corruption in the cavity of the bone; and it does not appear to the sense in its appearance, and compel the saw to its own vice.  
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the mouth is corrupted and not prominent, but its part continues with a part; and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in a part of it, then expose the flesh from all sides entirely. 
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then put wood underneath. 
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the saw continues from the other part; and let the saw be according to the length from the corruption a little, as we said. 
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	But if the corruption is at the junction, cut the corrupted junction itself, and saw the mouth where it continues from the other part. 
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the corruption is in the continuation of two junctions, then there is no skill in it except abrasion.  
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	But if the corruption is in the comb of the hand, or in the comb of the foot; then the matter in it is very difficult. 
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.  
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And abrade it, and clean it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever skill you are able to rectify it: when it does not cause opposition to you by vein, or nerve.  
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that cutting tools and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and magnitude, and smallness, and hardness, and rarity. 
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.  
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you above the species of instrument by which you need, when you have a long study. 
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the ways of this art is a testimony to the ways of illnesses; for then you will already find by yourself what suits it from the instruments for every infirmity. 
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I affirm to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you place examples upon which you cut, and the trial by which you experiment upon others.  
Forma Serrae.	Shape of Saw. 
Forma alterius Serrae.	Shape of another saw. 
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw. 
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw. 
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of saw depicted, let it be made decently. 
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arch be sharpness from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and let it be pyramidally made decently. 
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Shape of a scraper for joints. 
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this scraper be according to the shape of the head of a star-shaped nail: and its points let be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi. 
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not fitting unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it when they are corrupted or the mouth is wide and large. 
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Shape of a larger scraper. 
Forma medii Rasorii.	Shape of a middle scraper.  
Forma Rasorii lati.	Shape of a wide scraper. 
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of a scraper in which there is concavity. 
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Shape of another subtle scraper. 
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Shape of another scraper of curved extremity.  
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Shape of a small, subtle, thin scraper. 
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Shape of a scraper with which bones are incised.  
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Shape also of a large scraper. 
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a spoke, and its extremity is like a saw: it is exhibited in many places for the reason of bones.  
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Shape of a scraper which suits the reason of that which is perforated from bones. 
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremity is triangular, and its extremities are pointed. 
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from India. 
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly it is fitting that all which we have said be made from scrapers, and incisors, and saws. 
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Concerning the incision of extremities, and the locking of bones. 
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter Eighty-Nine.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities putrefy, either from an external or internal cause. 
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medical treatment, and the treatment does not help; and you see the corruption fall upon a limb, which is unaffected by anything: then it is necessary that you cut into that limb until you reach the corruption, so that the weak person may be saved from death, or from the greater evil which is the loss of the limb. 
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this happening is that the limb turns black, until it seems as though fire has burned it, or it rots after the blackness: until that rot reaches what follows that limb and spreads throughout the whole body. 
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures: such as a sea scorpion, viper, lizard, and similar ones. 
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	Therefore if the corruption or sting is at the end of a finger, then cut into the finger and do not allow space for the corruption to advance up to the rest of the hand. 
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the focus, and do not allow space for the corruption until it reaches the focus of the arm. 
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades that, then cut the arm at the elbow in its joint. 
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption passes through and you see it around the elbow, then there is death for the weak person in that.  
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And besides this from treatment, there is the quantity of strength. 
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And do likewise with the foot, when the corruption invades a toe, then cut it at one of its knots; and if it reaches the arch of the foot, then cut off the whole foot. 
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no wisdom in it except dismissal and leaving the weak person to death. 
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	The way to cut a limb, or sew it up, is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut, and another ligature above the place. 
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	Let one assistant extend the lower ligature downward and let another assistant extend the upper ligature upward. 
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	Then separate the flesh between the two ligatures with a broad spatula until all the flesh is exposed.  
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then cut or sew. 
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth over all the parts so that the saw does not touch the healthy area; and apply a warm poultice to the injured part. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if internal bleeding occurs while you are working, then quickly cauterize the spot or place some powders that staunch bleeding over it. 
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is complete.  
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and care for it until it heals. 
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that this same accident happened to a man on his foot.  
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	For it happened that a blackness appeared on his foot, like a burn similar to fire: and that corruption first occurred on his toe until it began to spread throughout the whole foot. 
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	The man therefore hurried to cut it away from himself after he saw the corruption spreading through his limb with its violence, as he found from the pain and burning: and he cut it at the joint and was healed. 
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, that same corruption happened to him on the index finger of his hand. 
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He therefore came to me and I tried to restore that excess with what I put on his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body; and the excess was not repelled and began to spread into another finger until the corruption began to spread into his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He therefore called me to cut off his hand; and I did not want to do it, hoping for a recovery from that excess on my part; and I also feared death for him at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's strength was above the case. 
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	And when he therefore despaired of me, he returned to his land; and there came to me news of him, that he hastened, and fell with his whole hand; and he was healed. 
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this account, except that it may be a help concerning that which falls upon the type of this disease; and that it may be a sign by which it is signified, and according to which it is acted.  
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Of the Treatment of Sinuses, and the Quality of Clysterization with Medicines. 
Caput XC.	Chapter Ninety. 
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged, until it makes a collection of pus; then it breaks, or is perforated, and what is within it comes out as pus, and there remains an empty space as if it were a vessel; and the skin which is upon it, like a cloth which has already been thinned: and it does not proceed to its ultimate corruption, nor press into the mouth, nor into a nerve, nor into a ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and not a Fistula; nevertheless if the space of it is prolonged until it presses the corruption into any one of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken. 
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the treatment of it is, that you cut all that skin as it revolves; and especially when it has been thinned, and made like cloth; and trust because it does not adhere to the place, on account of its corruption.  
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and the ultimate corruption does not follow from it; and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then treat it with a clyster; and it is, that you consider it as to the Sinus. 
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus which is emitted from it has a foul odor; then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, are gathered in a vessel: and they are decocted over fire until the medicine reddens; and it comes to the thickness of honey. 
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need and dissolve it with water and honey, and inject it into the Sinus with an enema, and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours. 
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure; do this for as many days until the Sinus is cleansed and the stench is removed. 
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is enemaed with ash water, when this medicine is not present for you; and it is that you should take ash from vine wood or ash from holly wood; and pour water over it. 
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and enema with it until you are confident that the Sinus has already been washed.  
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	But if the sick person does not tolerate Egyptian medicine nor ash water, then enema them with water and honey to which some crushed ziniar has already been mixed. 
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or enema them with honey and wine mixed together, since it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash; and wine makes the Sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.  
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do that several times, and are confident that the Sinus corruption has already been removed; then enema them with that which causes flesh to grow in it. 
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is that you should take some diafynicon plaster and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or enema them with certain medicines and other ointments, the properties of which I have written in the treatise on ointments.  
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	But if the opening of the Sinus is tight, into which the enema cannula does not fit; then widen it a little with iron; or place in it licorice wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment until it widens.  
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the opening is also wide; then bring together its lips with suture and let out from it the amount into which the enema can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the opening from which pus flows is raised upwards: then cut it into a lower place within it so that the pus may flow downwards; for pus when constricted in the depth of a sinus prevents flesh from being generated there. 
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus somewhat below it according as you wish: then endeavor to prepare the limb by preparation so that pus may flow from it with ease according as it is prepared for you. 
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Endeavor that nothing of the pus be retained in it at all; and take consolidating medicines which are placed upon a sign, suitable to what you desire. 
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them upon linen cloth.  
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that communication of the whole sinus may be made. 
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps a hole directly into the opening of the sinus, somewhat larger than the opening of the sinus.  
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from soft ointments upon another cloth according to the quantity of the hole; and place it upon it at a distance from the opening of the sinus so that the flow of pus may be relieved therefrom; and do not remove the large cloth except after several days at once. 
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But that which is upon the opening of the sinus is that which you remove every hour so that what collects in it from pus may exit; and so that you may know whether that which flows from it is much or little; or digested or undigested. 
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the place of the sinus itself whether the master thereof feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it; and whether there is an abscess in it or not.  
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Therefore when your treatment is thus extended and you see the material which flows out upon the opening of the sinus; then know that the sinus already adheres or approaches adhesion; then therefore dissolve it in the morning or on the third day; and when you dissolve the wound, then change another cloth and renew the ointment.  
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if after a long time a subtle virus comes out of the sinus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are people who delay the formation of flesh in their wounds, and some who act contrary to that. 
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if after many days pus that is undigested comes out of the sinus, then you will know that the sinus does not adhere. 
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	Therefore if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its matter prolonged, then add to the drying medicines what physicians truly do, so that the medicines are humid in their substance and dry in their power: such as dyafinicon ointment, when an excess of zegi addition is added to it. 
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the best last treatment there is, take dyafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and pour old wine equal to it in substance over it. 
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it. 
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now honey acts similarly to this when you are not present with dyafinicon ointment, boil it until it thickens and use it. 
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh and aloe and frankincense: grind the whole thing and sprinkle it on honey while it is over the fire. 
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then lay a cloth over it and bind it over the sinus; and smear it with honey which you have boiled until it has thickened and sprinkle spices over it, then place a cloth over it and bind it. 
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes long aristolochia is administered with roots of the celestial lily and lily; herb flour, and centaury. 
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simply or combined, grind them and sift them; then sprinkle them over the honey I have described and use it. 
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	And if the matter of the sinus is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it; or it is already making an impression on the bones, or in the remaining hard members, or ligaments: then cure it with a treatment for fistulas, according to what has been mentioned before. 
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of whitlow and ingrown toenail, and cutting open a finger that has been added to it, and sectioning. 
Caput XCI.	Chapter Ninety-One. 
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and perhaps it arises in the other fingers. 
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	Therefore when the matter of it is prolonged and its cure is neglected, and it becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, or it is corrupted and discharges pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone until it has a foul odor, and the extremity of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.  
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	Therefore when you treat it, as we said in the division, and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary that you cut with an iron all the excess that remains from the nail. 
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.  
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cautery is very beneficial. 
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	But if the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail already press the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin Radix under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards; and cut the flesh with ease, and put on it what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, corrosive ones until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed. 
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	But if the corruption has already pressed into the bone, then it is necessary that you cut open that bone and remove it; for it will never heal while a corrupted bone remains in it. 
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	And if you see the corrosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one node, according to what its previous remembrance has said. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed. 
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however it should happen that a nail is rubbed or struck and there arises in it intense pain, then it is necessary first of all to let blood from the weakling. 
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula and cut it transversely from above downwards. 
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail for you will cause through that extreme pain to the weakling and it will be a cause of the addition of new flesh in the place. 
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with something that soothes pains. 
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	But an added finger which is born in some men's hands, perhaps it is entirely fleshy and perhaps there are bones in some of them and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born at the root of the joint or its birth is in certain nodes of the finger. 
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	That therefore which is born in certain nodes of the finger does not move and that which is born at the joint of the finger perhaps moves.  
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore the section of it which is fleshy is easy. 
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula. 
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the treatment of that whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore abstain from its incision.  
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But in that which is born in the finger at the last of the nodes then it is necessary first to cut its flesh with a round cut down to the bone. 
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.  
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals. 
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The consolidation which happens to fingers to each other very often happens either from the birth of man that is it is born with him or from the consolidation of a wound or burning by fire and similar things. 
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is therefore necessary to cut that consolidation until the fingers return according to their natural form.  
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them linen cloths, or rags soaked in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead, until the place consolidates as it should. 
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if a consolidation should happen to certain fingers with the palm, then cut that consolidation according to how it is prepared and suits the shape of the limb. 
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Concerning the Incision of a Vice. 
Caput XCII.	Chapter Ninety-Two. 
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Varices are Veins enveloped, thick, full of superfluous melancholic humors which occur in many members of the body: and their most frequent occurrence is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel, work, and carry burdens. 
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary that you administer a shaking of the body from black bile frequently with vigorous shaking.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then phlebotomy for the patient, letting blood from the basilic vein. 
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of them with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they be cut, and black blood be extracted. 
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the Vein be raised and entirely extracted.  
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of it, however, is according to this method: 
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First embrocate the leg with much hot water until the thick feculent blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the infirm person's leg from the upper part of their hip to the lower part of their knee with a bandage. 
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three, with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise it up, that is, draw out the blood into your hand from the lower part of the leg upward; and from the upper part the phlebotomist must first phlebotomize the infirm person.  
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut with the instrument as far down as needed, until a quantity of blood comes out which you see is sufficient and which the strength of the infirm person can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it and order him to abstain from foods that produce black bile; and repeat evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and it harms the sick person. 
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of this is according to this method. 
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the sick person, if there are many hairs on it. 
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce him into a bath; or embrocate him on his leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins swell out; or he is exercised with strenuous exercise, if a bath is not present for him, until the limb is heated. 
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin directly on the vein section lengthwise; or at its last part near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel. 
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks and expose the vein from all sides until it appears to the senses; and at its appearance, you see it reddish towards a dusky decline. 
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it emerges from the skin, you see it white as if it were a cord. 
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce a Radix beneath it until it is raised and emerges from the skin; suspend it with a blind hook, gentle. 
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another section near that section by three fingers. 
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then expose the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise it with Radixes as you did and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first. 
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another section, or several sections, if necessary for that. 
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then raise and cut it with the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it to the section which is above it. 
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you extract it from the higher section, or all the higher sections, until it emerges completely; then cut it. 
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you in being extracted and raised; then introduce a needle with a strong double thread and tie it and extract it; or introduce a Radix beneath it and revolve your hand to all sides until it emerges. 
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it fall. 
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it falls, it will be difficult for you to raise it up greatly, and harm comes upon the weak one from it. 
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore when you have extracted it entirely, then place wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil upon the place of the wound, and tend to it until it heals.  
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	But if the Vine is contracted, having a twist with an involution to its parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you cut upon it at every part of its twist, and its places of involution. 
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you raise it entirely and beware at your section upon it lest you fall upon a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to raise or extract it. 
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence. 
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Form of the Falling Vine, How It Is Healed. 
Forma Vncini caeci.	The Form of a Blind Vine.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have a curvature like the other Hooks, nor is it of an acute point so that it would not wound a vein and it is of a thick, gentle flexuousness: for if it were slender, it would fall upon the vein by its slenderness: rather let it have excessive thickness as we said. 
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of a Leg Vein.  
Caput XCIII.	Chapter Ninety-Three.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This Vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Alizegi and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands of little tenderness, that is, those in which neither herb nor tree is born.  
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs. 
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is indeed from the putrefaction that happens under the skin, just as it happens within bodies of serpents and ascaris worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh. 
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	The mark of the beginning of this event of the Vein is a vehement inflammation which occurs in the leg. 
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place blisters. 
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the Vein begins to come out from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal. 
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	Therefore when its extremity appears from it, it is necessary that you envelop upon it a piece of lead, whose weight is from one scruple to two and bind it: and let the lead hang suspended from the leg. 
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore anything issues from it to the outside, envelop that in the lead and bind it.  
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	And if it is prolonged much, then cut a part of it and envelop the remainder. 
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it entirely before it issues forth altogether.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh: and it causes an abscess to occur, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer. 
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be gently handled and drawn out gradually until it issues forth from its last part, and nothing remains of it in the body: and from this indeed Vein there issues forth in some men what is five palms and ten in length.  
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has come to me that it issued forth from a man of twenty palms. 
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it happens to you in the hour of your medication: then insert a ray into its hole and pierce it with a long hole through the body until all that is in it of matter is evacuated: and administer putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days.  
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for it with the treatment of abscesses. 
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this indeed Vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and there are many openings to it, and a branch issues forth from every opening.  
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore care for it, as we said in the division, and with that which has been stated before. 
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On the Section of Worms Bred Under the Skin, and It Is Called the Disease Bouina.  
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter Ninety-Four. 
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This ailment is called in a certain land among us the bovine disease: because it very often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm, which is born between the skin and flesh. 
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it wanders throughout the whole body, ascending and descending: and it is shown to the senses during its movement from limb to limb, until it bursts wherever it bursts in the skin, and comes out. 
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors. 
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and snakes happen, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in the belly.  
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its harmfulness. 
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it wanders in the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens up there, and comes out, and destroys the eye: and that happens very often.  
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore when you wish to cure it, and extract it, then it is not done except at its movement, and appearance to the senses. 
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore that you bind what is above it, and what is below it with a strong constriction ligature.  
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it. 
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	But if it burrows into the flesh, and you do not find it: then apply a cautery with fire upon the place, until it dies. 
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater thing that is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we said.  
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind a good constriction under it above the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry it over itself and pull it out. 
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person use purification of his body with medicines dissolving foul bad humors. 
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods producing putrefaction. 
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Concerning the incision for the ailment Nakir. 
Caput XCV.	Chapter Ninety-Fifth. 
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This ailment is called in our land Nakir, and it is a pain that occurs in certain members; then it is transformed from member to member. 
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have indeed already seen it, according as I relate to you. 
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was summoned to a sick woman in certain ulcers. 
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she exposed her arm and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the cord of the arm.  
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for one hour, I saw one swelling advance with a hiss, just as a worm advances, ascending to her shoulder faster than it is possible; so that it be like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place. 
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain withdrew from that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm. 
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she narrated to me that it revolved throughout her whole body, according as I saw.  
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore I marveled at the speed of its transformation from member to member. 
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself had not seen this ailment with my own eyes in this way before.  
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	Nevertheless I have seen many who find pain transformed from member to member; and I have not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in the woman.  
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it to be anything other than because the woman was one of those with dry bodies and exposed veins; therefore this windiness transformed appears to the senses. 
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear according to this method in those who are delicate and with moist bodies, hidden veins. 
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	Therefore when you wish its cure and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to your eye as we said, then constrict above it and beneath it quickly: and cut above it until that wind comes out constricted: and cauterize the place. 
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your own eyes: then treat it with shaking of the body and with that which expels winds and drives them out with foul-smelling pills, and pills of pellitory and the like. 
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the Extraction of Arrows. 
Caput XCVI.	Chapter Ninety-Sixth.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are diversified according to their kinds and according to the places in which they fall from the body. 
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity indeed is: because of them there are those which have large points and small points: and concave ones, and deaf ones. 
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And of them there are those which have three angles.  
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And of them there are those which have tongues. 
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And of them there are those which have stars. 
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those indeed which are according to the limbs in which they fall, are according to two ways.  
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the limbs are from principal concave limbs such as the brain and heart and liver and lung and kidneys and intestines and bladder and those similar to them. 
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	Therefore when it falls into any of these limbs and the signs of death appear to you which I shall tell you afterwards: then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them for death follows him in whom it is in many dispositions.  
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not concealed in the depth of the limb, then extract it and care for the wound. 
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the mouth and exits through the siphac which is above the brain, the following occur: violent headache, dimness of vision, vertigo, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasm, confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile. 
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood flows from the nostrils or ears. 
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed. 
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And moisture white like pulp exits from the place of the wound. 
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there exits from it something similar to the wateriness of flesh. 
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	Therefore, if these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment and extract the arrow if it does not exit. 
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left nipple and he feels as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in a hollow thing. 
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps there is motion of the arrow similar to the motion of the pulse and black blood runs from the wound.  
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following that is coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting. 
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death descends without doubt. 
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it has wounded the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound and the vessels which follow the neck become inflamed and the color of the sick person changes.  
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, deep breath and seeks the attraction of cold air. 
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	But if the arrow should fall into the veil which is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs and there is great panting with violent pain accompanied by sighing and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved. 
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow should fall into the stomach, then perhaps undigested food will come out from the wound. 
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow should fall into the belly and lodge there: dung will come out from the wound, or phlegm, or intestine which has already been ruptured. 
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore there is no hope in its cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow. 
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	And if an arrow should fall into the bladder and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger upon the sick person: then you know that it is mortal. 
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	But the remaining limbs, such as the face and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and armpit, and spine, and clavicle, and thigh, and leg, and those similar limbs are saved according to many arrangements: when the arrow does not find an artery or nerve: and the arrow is not poisonous.  
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen about these arrows so that you may know through it concerning your treatment. 
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is, because to a certain man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore I extracted it from him on the other side under the fat of his ear and he was healed and no harm befell his eye. 
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which had fallen to him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid and the arrow was already hidden and I did not obtain from it except a small portion of its end with which it adhered to its wood and it was a large arrow from the arrows of Turkish bows, with mild iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore the Jew was healed and no bad accident befell his eye. 
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian. 
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is that which has ears. 
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore, I placed it upon her between two guides, and now it was submerged in her throat. 
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	So I dealt carefully with it until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed. 
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and we thought that he would die from it. 
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	Therefore, after thirty days had passed him and nothing changed in his condition, I placed myself over the arrow, and I contrived upon it, and extracted it; and he was healed, and no bad thing happened to him. 
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound had become consolidated over it. 
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Therefore, after seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip. 
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen in her belly, and the wound became consolidated over it, and the arrow remained inside her; and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman did not find harm from it in any of her natural operations. 
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen on his face, and the wound became consolidated, and it remained, not finding him much pain; and similar things to these, many. 
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen to him in the middle of his nose, and it had already declined towards the right side a little, and the whole arrow was hidden. 
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	Therefore, I was called to cure him after the fall of the arrow for up to three days. 
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found therefore the wound of the arrow very tight.  
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	Therefore I sought it with a subtle touch and did not feel it; and he himself found a prickling and pain under his right ear. 
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that it was that prickling from the extremity of the arrow. 
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Therefore I plastered the place with a plaster in which there was attractive and digestive power, confident within myself that the place would be poulticed, and a sign of an arrow would appear to me, so that I might cut above it: and nothing happened in the place indicating that the arrow had reached the place. 
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore I persevered with the plaster upon it for many days, and nothing happened, and meanwhile the wound became consolidated: and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days until he felt the arrow one day within his nose. 
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he related that to me. 
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore I placed upon that wound a sharp, corrosive medicine for many days until it opened: and when I tried, I touched it and felt the slender extremity of the arrow adhering in the wood. 
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine until the extremity of the arrow appeared visibly to us: and it passed for me with him a space of time of about four months. 
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound was enlarged and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into it and move it and it did not obey the exit: then I did not cease to refine and contrive upon it with ways of ingenuity until I began upon it one day with forceps well made, according to as their form will come at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it. 
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound. 
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And physicians indeed judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.  
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it, and the wound became consolidated and he was healed with perfect health: and nothing harmed him at all. 
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I relate to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows so that you might place that rule and meaning upon it of what I did not say.  
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration: nor does that book comprehend it, and a prudent craftsman compares with a little upon much: and with what is present, upon what is absent: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of foreign things of this art when they happen.  
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	Therefore, I say that arrows do not exit the limbs in which they are fixed except according to two modes. 
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place from which it entered. 
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the contrary of the other side. 
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place and is attracted and exits. 
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	But if it does not yield to exit at the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary that you dismiss it for several days until the flesh around it putrefies and its attraction is relieved and its exit. 
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in bone and does not yield to you for exit, then dismiss it also for several days and repeat it with attraction and motion every day until it exits. 
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	But if it does not yield to you for exit after those days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine awl until the arrow is enlarged.  
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it and extract it. 
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already proceeded into one of the ventricles of the brain, and there appear from weakness some of those accidents which I have mentioned: then abstain from attracting the arrow and dismiss it until its state is equal after days.  
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him. 
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of bone only and does not penetrate as far as the sifach and he remains weak for several days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents: then proceed with ingenuity in attracting the arrow and extracting it. 
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed deeply and does not yield to your attraction, then administer an awl around the arrow as I have described above; then care for the place until it heals. 
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow is already concealed in a place of the body and is hidden from sensation, then inquire for it with touch. 
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If, however, you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments which are suitable for its extraction. 
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you are not able to get hold of it because of the constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow in depth; and there is neither a bone nor a nerve nor a vein there: then cut down upon it until the wound is enlarged and it is possible to extract the arrow. 
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	But if it has ears by which to be held, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side with all the ingenuity you can do that, and ingenuity, if it is not possible to get past the flesh in the fracture of the ears and the twisting thereof until it comes out. 
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of an arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps to all sides until you make it come out; and subtle subtlety at the last so that the arrow is not broken and its attraction becomes difficult for you, and its extraction.  
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	But if you are not able to get it out within an hour, then leave it for several days until those which are around it become putrid. 
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it for the tension will be relieved. But if the flow of blood causes you opposition then administer what we said from healing in its chapter; and guard your strength from cutting a vein or a nerve or a cord. 
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer ingenuity in every way possible to you for the avoidance of the arrow; and let it be with ease and quietude, or slowness, and firmness as I have told you.  
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, that you make when you draw out the arrow, so that it be weak according to the figure according to which it was at the case of the arrow itself. 
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more beneficial.  
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures. 
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow which comes out from the opposite side, or already proceeds from it something to the exterior; or makes a hump at the extremity of the arrow by feeling from the upper part of the nearby skin and you see it prominent: cut then upon it, and let the incision be according to the amount that the forceps can grasp in it. 
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out; for it itself becomes easy to remove. 
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow presses into the bone and enlarges itself; then draw it out. 
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not, leave it for several days; then repeat the process until it comes out. 
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	But if the wood of the arrow is in it, then drive it in with that. 
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the wood has fallen out and you wish to administer a thrust, then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow; then drive it with that. 
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is concave, then drive it with an instrument entering into it. 
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is relieved by that.  
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	But if the arrow is poisoned, it is necessary that you scoop out all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so.  
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is suitable for that. 
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	But if the arrow falls into the chest, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side: and it is nearby from what you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and be cautious of incision of a vein, or nerve, and draw it out.  
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew the wound if you see fit, and treat it until it heals. 
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of forceps with which arrows are extracted.  
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the extremities be like a bird's beak, which are made like iron; when they grasp upon the arrow, they do not release it. 
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many kinds are made from them, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity, magnitude of the arrow, its scantiness, and the width of the wound and its tightness.  
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the speculum is concave. 
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the sound probe is blunt. 
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the extremity of the sound probe like a rod so that its entry is eased into the concave speculum and it is driven in with it. 
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this concave speculum is concave like a bird's feather so that the entry of the arrow into it is eased and its impulse.

Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a wide bloodletting. 
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it must not be of a pointed extremity, like the other bloodlettings, but rather of a wide extremity. 
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And let the bloodletting be across it, because the mouth is nearby and perhaps the lancet will break when it is slender. 
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	On bloodletting of the veins in the two lacrimal glands.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	On bloodletting of the veins of the nose. 
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	Phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is indicated for acute fever, and violent headache, and facial ailments such as hemiplegia, and redness which occurs on the face; especially when it is longstanding.

Then hold their nose with your left hand and take a thin, long phlebotomy instrument; and fix it in the middle of the nostril itself, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness. 
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	For the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately. 
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the phlebotomy instrument for a little while; and let the blood run according to your need.

Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And let it be until morning. 
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound heals. 
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	Concerning the Phlebotomy of Veins by Algeberich. 
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	Veins however are helpful for phlebotomy according to Algeberich: because they contribute to alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of the gum; and bad ulcers: and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those which are in the nose, and around it. 
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of their phlebotomy is that you make the weak person sit before you: and constrict his neck with a band.  
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then turn back his lip and look at the two veins: of which one is on the right of the lip, and the second on the left: and the demonstration of both is through the blackness of both. 
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And this is true: because around them are small, black veins.  
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore incise both with an intersecting incision. 
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if there is doubt upon you and you do not know which one it is: then attend to the incision of the larger one, and the more manifest one. 
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And do likewise with the two veins that are on the upper lip: and indeed most often this is done with it: and incise the two veins that are on the lower lip. 
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Concerning Phlebotomy of the Vein under the Tongue after Phlebotomy of the Cephalic Vein.  
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Indeed the phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is helpful for: phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for inflammations that are in the throat and pain of the uvula and pains of the mouth. 
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of their phlebotomy is that the weak person sits between your hands before the sun: and elevate his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein: and the color of both tends towards blackness.  
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore phlebotomize both: and take care that you do not put your hand into them while phlebotomizing. 
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under it are arteries, and perhaps blood flow may occur from those arteries. 
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the Three Veins in the Elbow. 
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	However, there are three veins in the elbow which are phlebotomized, and the practice of phlebotomy occurs in these in all people. 
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy of them is performed according to two methods. 
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle phlebotomy knife; or an olive-wood one sharpened to a point; or by cutting with a surgical knife, and it is called Alnesil.  
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	This is Alnesil, which is suitable for sectioning.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And among them are broad and fine ones according to the width of the veins and their firmness. The myrtle phlebotomy knife is broad, as you see.  
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave veins, full ones, those coming forth, apparent, large, and those which contain thick, cloudy blood. 
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomy knife is of lesser width and with a finer point. 
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for phlebotomy of fine veins which contain thin, yellow blood 
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Concerning Phlebotomy of the Basilic Vein.  
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is favorable for phlebotomy. 
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest and abdomen; and it behooves the phlebotomist to take care when phlebotomizing it, and to be fearful of the artery beneath it, for an artery is situated underneath.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore if he errs and adds to the puncture during phlebotomy, he will strike that artery and blood flow will occur.  
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary for the phlebotomist not to puncture the Basilic vein with a puncturing phlebotomy knife but rather to cut it with an Alnesil. 
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary that someone else expose it and change its position to another one, or seek another branch of it; or use a phlebotome in place of it on the arm. 
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it itself is manifest and cut it with the phlebotome Anesil as we have said. 
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to perform phlebotomy on it itself then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm that you touch the place until you recognize the place of the pulse. 
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with a cautery, afterwards constrict the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with the phlebotome Anesil as we have said. 
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful that percussion does not fall through the space from the place of the artery.  
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, as you are tightening the ligature, swelling in the place that you marked with a cautery, then that swelling is the swelling of an artery; therefore avoid it. 
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	For if you see the blood rise at the phlebotomy like the urine of a child and it is thin, reddish blood; then know that it is from arterial blood. 
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then hasten, and place your finger over the long space, then remove your finger.  
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the bleeding is cut off (for it often is) then constrict the arm and release it; and let the weak person be warned against movement; and let there be fear over them. 
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let them not move for several days until they are healed.  
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the bleeding is not cut off and overcomes you and there is no medicine present to you at that moment then cut into the artery if it appears to you. 
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are contracted and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of a pistachio nut and grind it; take one half and constrict it over the place of the vein with a decent constriction, with a ligature and poultices up to another day. 
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is shed, it is good. 
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then care for it with him whose memory preceded from the place of the powders cutting off the flow of blood: and the incision of his blood is not difficult in many positions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a ligature from the arm. 
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the Phlebotomy of the Basilic Vein. 
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The phlebotomy of the Basilic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from both the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalica, as we have said. 
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it behooves the phlebotomist to be above fear from its phlebotomy, for beneath it is a nerve. 
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds in the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, numbness occurs in it, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it does not heal completely.  
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses. 
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people and is subtle and does not show: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where the phlebotomist cuts a section with Alnesil, and avoids the nerves with your strength.  
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length. 
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the Cephalic Vein.  
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and contributes to eye diseases.  
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein especially if you wish, that the phlebotomist punctures it with an olive phlebotome or a myrtle phlebotome; because it is the safest of all veins, since there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it behooves you at the time of phlebotomy to avoid with the phlebotome only the head of the lizard, and seek a gentler spot; and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first percussion, so that he repeats over it with the phlebotomy several times.  
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps an abscess may form in some people when bloodletting is not performed in the first percussion, but it does not harm them to have such an abscess somewhere. 
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the benefit of bloodletting and the cautions to be observed therein. 
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of bloodletting, however, and its accidents arising from it, in whose correction you ought to think. 
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First, therefore, it is of which you ought to know, that bloodletting is not administered except in the preservation of health and its continuance, and caution from the arrival of illnesses. 
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that bloodletting should be done in one of three veins which are in the elbow, namely, the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilica. 
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that bloodletting should be done at the beginning of Spring on a fast, in Spring and Summer; and Autumn and Winter after a meal, when the signs of repletion appear. 
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let bloodletting be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed since the day began.  
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Bloodletting which is administered in illnesses does not have a determined hour; but when it provokes suitability and necessity for that, at night or day, and in every hour, and in every time.  
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled except from the fourth month up to the seventh. 
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old men who have already passed sixty years be bled.  
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When, therefore, someone wishes to be bled for whatever reason: it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before bloodletting with a gentle enema if there is much retained feces in them so that the veins do not draw away foul and harmful superfluities from the intestines to the principal members during bloodletting.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient be bled when he has surfeit, that is, sickening fullness; nor when drunk, nor recovering from drunkenness until that is removed from them. 
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor a weak person with dropsy. 
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let bloodletting be avoided again after a colic attack, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and multiplication of intercourse, and labor, and exertion, and wakefulness, and fasting, and everything that dissolves virtue from the bodily or animal thing. 
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider in the subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if possible to him do that. 
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prohibits him from it: or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood becomes thinner. 
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his bloodletting in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we said: and try, that his chest be evacuated that day from all animal evils accidents: such as distress, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive intercourse, and those like them.  
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let the things customary for his dwelling be present with whose use men ran custom from fragrance, and scent, and rejoicing and those like them by as much quantity as possible. 
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion which is higher than the cushion of the person undergoing bloodletting; afterwards let him extract his arm and rub it with his hand twice or thrice. 
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tie a ligature with a bandage, and wrap it twice. 
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be temperate, for when the constriction is unequal, or by excess in the constriction then it hinders the course of blood: or in slackness, then it also hinders the course of blood.  
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction it is necessary that the phlebotomist rubs his hands together at the same time until the veins swell and declare themselves to the sense. 
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the phlebotomist cleanse the place to be lanced with a little oil, properly an old one. 
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place the index finger of his left hand upon the very vein under the place where he desires to perform the phlebotomy, slightly: so that the vein does not flee, and the percussion may be made. 
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For since some veins are like a fleeing chord at phlebotomy and some are full of windiness; and when you place the phlebotome upon them, they contract under the phlebotome, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the phlebotome does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it is strict: therefore on account of this, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and diligent in all these matters. 
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should lay down the phlebotome. 
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened from one place, then it is good.  
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that at another place a little below or above it with haste: if the place is not apostatized. 
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	But if it is apostatized or becomes weak and swollen, then dismiss him for a day or two and do not bind the ligature. 
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For it might perhaps draw a hot abscess. 
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor let him enter a bath.  
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him repeat the phlebotomy if he desires. 
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	But if the opening is small, or the blood runs subtly; and you fear that the quantity of blood will not go out which you wish: then repeat the phlebotome in the same hole according to straightness, and add a little in the operation.  
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with haste before the place is apostatized; for an apostatized place is in many men at a small operation. 
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	But if you see that it is already apostatized, then do not repeat upon it at all, for nothing excuses this to you. 
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something from the dregs of oil upon it; because it relieves the course of blood.  
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than other oils. 
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly apply the feces of oil in all your phlebotomies, which phlebotomists do well at the stopping of the course of blood; and they do this with tyriaca, alfarach, and sagzenea, when one of them is placed upon the place. 
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick. 
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	And if it should happen that a large abscess occurs at the place of phlebotomy, for this often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except for that vein, or the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and put a sponge infused in water and salt, heated a little, upon the place; and bind it for an hour, for it will be dissolved. 
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has come out from the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein. 
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	And if something of blackness, or greenness should remain in the place after a few days, it does no harm; and if you wish, put something of aloe, or myrrh dissolved upon it: or something from the juice of mint, that is, calamint or something like it.  
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And indeed abscesses and prominences often occur at phlebotomy in the Basilica. 
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore put your hand upon it; then if you find softness under your pressure upon it, then that prominence is bad. 
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore beware, that you put something of what we said upon it. 
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps arterial blood will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place hardens.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed. 
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you draw from every man blood according to the quantity of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color conquering over the blood. 
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it reddens; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is taken away. 
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting with one cup, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged, and the phlebotomist be wide; and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that. 
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he extract it in cups, and that the hole be narrow; and better in phlebotomy of the vein is what is administered, that there be a transverse section, not a puncture.  
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy by width and length. 
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for whom syncope is accustomed to happen at bloodletting, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a small loaf soaked in pomegranate juice water; or secaniabin if it is heated; and you should draw from him three or four cups of blood. 
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold complexion, then he should take before phlebotomy bread soaked in syrup of mue, or in syrup of honey spiced with spices, or in fragrant aromatic syrup. 
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncope should happen at bloodletting and the cause of it is excess blood loss then it is necessary that he drink meat broth and a subtle fragrant syrup; and use aromatics with agarwood and line his chest with them; and use the other things which we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.  
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	He who wishes to spare his arm and to let out his blood a second time; it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is for great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he should let out blood gradually by the amount of his strength on continuous days.  
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	He who wishes to experiment on his own arm and to let out his blood a second time, and whose body is strong, then he should do this after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting. 
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But he who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it leans, ought to have it done to him on the second or third day. 
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	But in him whose body has much blood already heated and sharpened, and it causes a fever to happen: it is necessary that the blood should go out from it at once, and a large quantity be drawn from it, and the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting and so that you put your hand upon his pulse along the course of the blood, so that death does not happen in place of fainting. 
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Very often this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs. 
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you wish to open the arm and let out blood a second time, since the opening of the vein has already closed and the blood's exit becomes difficult, to press upon it with violence and quickly straighten it. 
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very bad indeed, rather let it alone until a second bloodletting is performed. 
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with sharpness of the phlebotomist's tool that which has been clotted from the blood in the opening of the vein and put something dissolved salt upon it. 
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put something from Tyrian agaric or wormwood on it and apply a soft compress until the blood flows out. 
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein has already become inflamed, then leave it alone and do not press upon it until the inflammation subsides. 
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity compels to let out blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either the phlebotomist should perform it above that place or on another arm in another vein.  
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The vein-cutting place for the arm is on the side of the elbow, and on the wrist, if they are not found hidden, because it is composed of them. 
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its vein-cutting is such that the sick person should insert his hand into warm water until the arm reddens and the vein appears manifestly. 
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it should be bound upon it with a ligament with a little medium constriction. 
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the vein-cutting should be done transversely little by little, not laterally nor according to length, and let the opening be wide, and let your vein-cutting be such that you do it above the junction of the hand a little. 
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	And if the flow of blood is prohibited, then immerse the hand again in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your purpose. 
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the summer days, then excuse yourself from immersing the hand in warm water again. 
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the course of blood is put mostly into warm water in the time of winter.  
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the vein-cutting of this vein is safer than all veins because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve under it. 
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	But vein-cutting of the Saluatella vein on the right hand brings relief to illnesses of the liver.  
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its vein-cutting is such that you should bind the inner part of the hand with a ligament, or your own hand, after you have immersed it in warm water until the vein swells and is shown distinctly to the senses.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then cut the vein transversely.  
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you happen to cut it entirely, it will not harm her in any way. 
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And preserve, that you do not finish your hand with the vein-cutting.  
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the nerves of the fingers exposed from flesh. 
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then immerse the hand again into warm water and let the blood run into it.  
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeatedly immerse it in warm water, the blood clots in the vein's opening and prevents its course. 
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	Therefore, when you have extracted the necessary amount from the blood, then place oil and salt upon the vein so that it does not quickly solidify. 
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is necessary to do this with every narrow branch. 
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The performance of its phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it brings relief to spleen diseases: and similarly do this in its phlebotomy just as you did in the second equally. 
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	But the benefit of phlebotomy from the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menses, and infirmities of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar diseases. 
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should place their foot in warm water and rub it until the veins protrude; and bind above the joint of the foot with a tourniquet. 
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the location of the veins is near the heel, apparent towards the thumb; and there branch out from it many branches on the surface of the foot.  
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, phlebotomize it in a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its cluster; because this is better and safer. 
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	But if you phlebotomize it on the surface of the foot, then be careful of the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.  
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your incision for phlebotomy across it, as if you wished to cut it; and let the phlebotomist be Nesil. 
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the flow of blood is impeded, then immerse their foot again in warm water and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated. 
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	But if the phlebotomist misses the vein at first, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for this location is safe and you need not fear any harm from it when you are careful of the nerves, as we have said.  
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And likewise with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally. 
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we said, is at the heel from the outer side. 
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for pain in the buttock when it is due to hot blood.  
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is for the weak one to enter a bath and hurry; and to bind his leg from the side of the buttock up above the heel with four fingers using a thin, long strip: for it does not appear except because of that.  
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	Therefore when it appears, then make a phlebotomy on it according to whatever skill is possible for you, or according to transversal cutting; and it is better either that you strike it with an incision or divide it by sectioning.  
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it itself is very hidden in most people. 
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	And if you do not find it and it does not appear to the senses at all, then make a phlebotomy on one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot and towards the auricle; and be careful of the nerves, and let a quantity of blood run out as much as you wish.  
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction and put skin over the place of the phlebotomy and bind the place. 
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly. 
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On Cupping and the Quality of its Use
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter Ninety-Eight
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cups are made from horns, and from metal, and from glass. 
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping indeed is done according to two methods. 
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and the extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification.  
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification is according to two methods. 
Aut enim est cum igne.	For either it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire. 
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And there are fourteen places in the body where cupping is administered with scarification and bloodletting. 
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of these, one is Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck; and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck from both sides together; and the cupping of the mind, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; and the cupping of two spatulas; and the cupping of Alachosos on top of the end of the tailbone; and the cupping of two focilium, and they are the middle of the two arms; and the cupping of two legs; and the cupping of two calves. 
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping indeed does not extract blood from you through the fine veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore its virtue does not fall away from them, as is the case with it from phlebotomy. 
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should cupping be administered either with fire or without fire in any diseases that arise from repletion until the whole body is evacuated. 
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	And if necessity compels cupping from illness or for custom, we administer it at any hour in the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at any time it may be. 
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	For it is because some people when blood multiplies within them until they need its extraction through cupping, find heaviness and a headache in their head. 
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And there are some of them who find repletion and redness in their face, head, and neck.  
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And there are some of them who find itching on their face and forehead, darkness, and dullness in their eyes.  
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there are some of them who scratch the place of their cupping. 
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there are some of them whose laughter increases. 
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And there are some who find the taste of blood in their mouth, or their tongue swells and sheds blood. 
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose sleep is multiplied. 
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is he who sees in his dream blood and redness, and those who are dead, and wounds, and things which are similar to these. 
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	Therefore when we see something of these things, and especially if it is in the third part of the month, we order then that venesection be done, after two hours or three have passed from the day.  
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The advantage of venesection of the neck is that it brings gravity to the head, and what is poured out goes to the eyes.  
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But truly it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of the whole body. 
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is a venesection in place of cephalic phlebotomy.  
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted that one with a cold complexion, or who has catarrh, use it. 
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings him great harm.  
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of this, it is not necessary that old men use it, and those in whose head are cold illnesses. 
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever habitually does this upon himself, forgetfulness arises in him.  
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of this, it is necessary that you order the phlebotomist to lower his hand a little with the venesection towards the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.  
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Venesection or cupping is in place of brown phlebotomy and basilica phlebotomy, and because of this it brings relief to asthma, and constriction of shortness of breath, and fissure of the instrument of breathing, and cough, and repletion.  
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the cupping be applied for a short time, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach. 
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Venesection on the temples brings relief to pains happening in the head, and ophthalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth, and it is in place of basilica phlebotomy. 
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the one who draws blood not to press with his hand during scarification so that he does not strike an artery and cause bleeding. 
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Bloodletting under the chin gathers humors in the mouth and for the inflammation of the gums and similar illnesses which are in the mouth; and it stands in place of phlebotomy in other parts which are on the two lips. 
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Bloodletting with spoons gathers for the phlegmatic humor which comes from reflux and heat.  
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Bloodletting with two cupping glasses gathers the benefit of phlebotomy from the veins the Basilica, the Fusca and the Cephalic; because it draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh and they draw from other larger veins until the drawing reaches those three veins. 
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the one who draws blood not to proceed much in scarification because the place is stripped of flesh and under it are nerves and arteries. 
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	A cup which is cupped on a swollen part gathers for hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers. 
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the one who draws blood that the cup be large and that it be of metal because the place needs strong suction and perhaps slender cups will break and it should be scarified with a large scarification. 
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Cupping glasses on the legs diminishes noticeably; because they draw blood from the whole body and they gather for old pains in the kidneys, the womb and the bladder; they provoke menses, and they gather phlegm and mucus; and they stand in place of phlebotomy of two saphenous veins and the femoral vein.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However they weaken the body greatly and cause fainting in many people. 
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of cupping on the femoral vein is close to the benefit of cupping on two legs. 
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the cupping glasses is to place them first empty and suck with temperate suction; and do not prolong the application of the cupping glasses but put them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors may come to the place by equal advent; and do not cease to repeat and continue this until you see the place already reddening and swelling, and the redness of blood appears; then scarify and repeat the suction gradually. 
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the arrangement of bodies. 
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of men of tender flesh, rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, no more: so that the place is not ulcerated. 
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the one who applies cupping glasses to enlarge the scarification and deepen it a little; and to temper the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion. 
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	But if there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice.  
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	For in the first indeed a way is opened for the refinement of the blood and its aqueousness; and in the second indeed a thorough examination for the exquisite extraction of thick blood. 
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	But if the blood is very feculent, then let there be a third scarification to follow the ultimate.  
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And lastly, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little, one scarification suffices us.  
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	But if we wish for much bloodletting, let us scarify with many scarifications. 
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we have measured that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification; and the equal end in scarification is the depth of the skin. 
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is it that ought to be administered from oils at the application of cupping glasses and what should the one applying cupping glasses beware of? 
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	Now in him indeed whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places for cupping be anointed with opening, softening, resolving oils: if it is in summer time, such as oil of alkana or oil of violets, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or syrup: and those like them. 
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	But if the excess is thick, cold: then let the oil be bitter almond, or balm of Gilead oil, or white oil, or anise oil: and those like them. 
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	But if the pores are to be opened on delicate flesh, then it is necessary that it be forbidden from oil, and it is necessary for them to wash the places of the openings after opening with rose water, or with cold water, or with solar water, or with cucumber water, or with purslane water: and those like them. 
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But he whose blood is of much humidity, let him wash the openings with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and those like them. 
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But he whose excesses are thick, let him wash his openings with old wine, or with water of samshoot, or a decoction of anise, or chamomile: and those like them. 
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that cupping be done in a bath, or in the vestige of a bath, indeed it is necessary that it be administered after exiting from the bath for an hour, or for two hours. 
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary for anyone to sleep after cupping.  
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it by which cupping, or phlebotomy should be regulated before cupping? 
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after it is necessary for you to consider first: then if the cupping or phlebotomy is choleric, and acuity and inflammation overcome his blood: then it is necessary that he take refrigerants, such as pomegranate rinds: and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and chicory, and jujubes: and those like them. 
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And make his foods chicken, and eggs, and foods seasoned with sourness: and those like them.  
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And for him whose constitution is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink syrup of honey, or of almond, or of asafetida made from seeds; and let him take spiced wine which is medium, that is between old and new; and let it be instructed that he use scarcity of food. 
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And let his food be chickens, and sparrows; and finches, that is, small birds; and squabs of pigeons he should eat. 
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting be more than food; and it is necessary that there be given in drink to some men in the hours tyriaca alfaroch, or a medicine from musk, that is, musk, or alesselithe before cupping; and before bloodletting, or after: so that the principal limbs may be strengthened, and the blood thinned.  
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink. 
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Concerning Cupping Without Scarification. 
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But cuppings which are without scarification are those which are placed upon the liver, and spleen, and gouty foot, and upon the belly, navel, and places of the kidneys, and the narrow part of the thigh; because these members do not suffer scarification upon themselves.  
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And there is not sought through them except either attraction of blood from a member to a member; just as we place the cupping glass upon the nipples in the sickness of a nosebleed. 
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them so that we may loosen from a member invisible coldness and wind in a member; just as we place the cupping glass upon the belly and navel. 
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes the pain therefore because it dissolves that windiness. 
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed upon the kidneys when obstruction or a stone occurs in them.  
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by its power of attraction it perhaps opens the obstruction, or extracts the stone from its place. 
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And he does the same when it is placed upon the liver, and the spleen in windy weather to ward off wind in both. 
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these cupping glasses are administered empty with incision only. 
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire. 
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in pleural diseases; and that is, that the cupping glass be filled and large, with warm water alone, or water in which herbs suitable for the purpose have been boiled. 
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of a cupping glass administered with fire.  
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two open fingers, according to what we have described; and let its depth be half a palm; and let there be a small hole on its side in a place which is approximately its middle, according to the size that a needle can enter; make it from brass or copper, with thick edges, smooth, equal, polished; so that it does not injure the limb upon which it is placed. And let there be a transverse rod of metal, or iron, in its middle, where a candle with fire is placed. 
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this cupping glass is made large, greater than that which we have described, and a little smaller than that, according to the diseases and age of him who uses it. 
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For cupping glasses for children and weaklings are different than cupping glasses for men and those with large bodies. 
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The manner of placing this cupping glass with fire upon a limb is to light a wick with fire from linen properly, or a small candle from wax; and place it upon the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass; so that the ignited fire be approximately beneath the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the body of the sick person is not burned.  
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it upon the limb; and let a finger be upon the hole which I mentioned, until whenever we hold the cupping glass: when we need to, let us remove the finger, and let vapor escape through that hole, and the cupping glass will immediately be released. 
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then apply fire to the ligature according to its manner, and repeat it if it is insufficient. 
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But the cupping glass which is applied in pleurisy with water has neither a transverse stick nor a hole, and it is not applied unless it is filled with water and placed only upon the limb. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger this cupping glass is, so that it can hold a great amount of water, the better it is.  
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	On the suspension of bloodletting instruments. 
Caput XCIX.	Chapter Ninety-Nine. 
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodletting instruments are not administered in many places except those where the positioning of cupping glasses is not possible due to their small size, such as the lip, and gum, and those similar to them. 
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a limb denuded of flesh, such as a finger, and nose, and those similar to them. 
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you should take it from bloodletting instruments which are in fresh waters, clean from putrefactions. 
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then let them be dismissed day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies. 
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should first be evacuated with bloodletting and cupping. 
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the limb of the sick person until it reddens. 
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place them upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	Therefore when they are filled and fall, and suction of the place is possible with a cupping glass, then it is best for healing; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. 
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, rub and squeeze it.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood continues after the fall of the bloodletting instruments, and it is oozing; then infuse a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the oozing stops. 
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then sprinkle powdered saffron or galls and those similar to them from astringents upon it until the blood stops. 
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or peeled beans are placed on the spot and left until they adhere to the place for the blood is cut off. 
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And if repetition of the cupping is necessary, when it is possible, change them. 
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if leeches are forbidden from suspension, then wash the place with fresh blood. 
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or stick a needle into the places until something comes out of the blood. 
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for they themselves when they feel something from the blood, adhere immediately.  
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall off, sprinkle over them something from ground aloe, or salt, or ashes, and they will fall off immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	General Discourse on Restoration and Dislocation and Treatment of Torsion and Similar Things. 
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This Chapter is also very often necessary in the Art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know you sons, that foolish doctors and the common people boast about this Chapter who have never looked at an ancient book nor read a letter from it. 
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this reason, this method is private from the sciences in our land. 
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never encountered anything entirely good in it and I have not attained from it what I attained except for the length of reading ancient books and study upon understanding them until I extracted knowledge of it from them. 
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and study throughout the length of my life.  
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from it in this Chapter all that contains my knowledge and on which my experiment passed after I shortened it for you and freed it from the occupation of elongation and shortened it without shortening and showed it without declination: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, with addition by declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters. 
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections from fractures of bones, from those whose presentation is necessary before we begin to recall fractured members and their various types. 
Caput II.	Chapter II. 
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is fitting that we say in the prologue of this chapter, summaries and chapters, to whose understanding the craftsman is compelled at first to attain: namely so that you and those who are ready may know or learn this noble art and teach it to others. 
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	Therefore I say that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or fall happens to someone, then it is necessary for you to hurry first to phlebotomize him and loosen him, or both together: if nothing forbids it such as weakness of strength, or he who suffers from one of these things is a child or decrepit old man, or the time is one of intense heat or intense cold. 
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables and poultry and kid meats; and forbid wine, fatty meats, and all foods that fill the veins with blood. 
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are safe from hot abscesses and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb; then let the invalid return to his first usual diet with which he was accustomed to run.  
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	Therefore when a broken bone begins to be restored, it is necessary for the invalid to eat nourishing foods of much nourishment, coarse and heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from boiled wheat with water, rice, heads and feet and bellies of cows, eggs, and fresh fish; and thick wine, and things like them.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For by this regimen coagulation of the fracture is done faster and better. 
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones when they are in veins which are in the first old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be continued and consolidated according to their nature always, because of the desiccation of their limbs; and those are consolidated and continued which are from them at the end of tenderness, such as the bones of small children. 
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Nevertheless, nature attaches to a fractured bone from every side something like glue, in which there is thickness, so that it adheres and binds itself until they are joined together and are united until it comes to an end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its own operations; and for this reason it is necessary that you place nourishment for the weak foods, in which there are heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we have said. 
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that fractures are of different kinds, according to the diversity of members; for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the spine bone; and similarly all the other members are different from each other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the kinds of bone fractures are also diversified within themselves. 
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For a fracture of it is arched, besides which stars occur in it. 
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture of it occurs along the length of the bone; and there are fractures of it that are sagittal, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as are in a reed pen, when a knife is fitted for writing. 
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding; and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head; and there is a small fissure fracture. 
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every kind has its own ingenuity or instrument for its restoration, according to what will come to remembrance of it, distinguished in its places.  
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from what a bone fracture is known is its crookedness and prominence; and the appearance of it to the sense, and the sound of it when you press it with your hand. 
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	Therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor a sound at your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the weak one find great pain; then there is no fracture there, rather it is possible that there is crookedness, or a small fissure: therefore, it is not necessary that you move it with your hand and compression altogether, rather place upon it from medicines, of which remembrance comes, after that moment which suits the place; then let it be bound with a fine bandage. 
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place arches and is split into two, except for what may happen to it in terms of satagiae, nevertheless every part is removed from its companion: then it is necessary for you to begin at your hour towards its rectification by evening it out before a hot apostema occurs to it. 
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a hot apostema should occur to it, then let it alone for several days until the apostema becomes quiet. 
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then even it out according to any way possible from gentleness and ingenuity.  
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and evening out is easier than bone, in which satagiae occur. 
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it up according to what will come to your recollection of it.  
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if there are satagiae in bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from its two parts, if it is a hand or foot; or with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand.  
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb upon an equal place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended: then try to make those additions return with all your ingenuity and according to any way you can in their places; and be careful according to your strength, lest pain or injury should occur upon the weak one through your operation: and try, according to your strength, to apply one of the two bones with its companion according to the better forms. 
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour for you to try and touch it with your hand.  
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see anything different there, correct it and even it out according to the amount of your strength. 
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful of vehement extension and strong compression, as many stupid people do.  
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	Very often they cause a hot apostema or contraction in the limb to occur through their operation: just as we have already seen that very often from their operations. 
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then apply after equalization and a decent operation and constriction of that member and rest and quietness: and warn the sick person about it. 
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware, lest he move it in the hour of his watchings and his sleep at its turning and its agitation and at its excretion and all its motions with its last strength.  
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he beware lest its position be a position with which pain follows. 
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Which is because when he feels pain or injury in the arrangement of the position of the member then it is necessary that he change it to another arrangement from which he does not feel pain. 
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And beware with him that its position be equal and straight so that crookedness may not happen in the member when it is restored. 
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the constriction of the fractured member is according to what I have said.  
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured members are diversified in their smallness and their largeness and their shape. 
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which therefore of them are small such as the arm and the finger and the knee joint and similar to these then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, subtle cloth. 
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But which of them are large such as the hip and the leg then it is necessary that there be a broad, hard wrapping upon them.  
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a broad bandage connects a large member and tightens it from every part with equal constriction so that a blemish does not enter it. 
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after your evacuation from equalization to put a suitable plaster upon it on soft lint over the place of its fracture.  
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage upon the place of its fracture with three or four wrappings according to what the member deserves and constrict your hand a little with the bandage.  
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to a part above the place of the fracture and constrict less than was your constriction with which you constricted the fractured place.  
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then lengthen it with inversion from the place of fracture a little, and soften the constriction gradually, until you take a large thing from a healthy place. 
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another strip, and again wrap it over the fractured place with inversions. 
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards go with inversion to the lower part from the fracture. 
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the constriction of inversion, and its softening, according to what we said in the first upper inversion. 
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the inversions from soft tow, or cloth, with which the crookedness of the fracture may be equalized, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, do not put anything in it. 
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another strip over it itself.  
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards equal over these inversions stars well-made immediately, if there is not inflation in the place, nor hot abscess.  
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is inflation or abscess in it: then put over it that which sits upon the abscess and removes the swelling; and let it be so for several days. 
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind stars over it at that time.  
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be from halves of broad cane, planed, wisely shaped; or let them be from wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or palm, that is, branches of palm, or calamus; and let the width of every star be according to this form, and this same figure. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However it is necessary that the star which is put over the very ligature be somewhat thicker and broader than the other stars; and the length of the star shall be according to what is permitted by the limb in size and smallness.  
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the stars with another strip, according to the same first binding. 
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind over it with threads well-made, according to what we said concerning the binding; and it is that your binding be over the fractured place more; and the further it is lengthened from the fracture, let the binding be less.  
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that they are threads medium in thickness and fineness, and are from soft flax. 
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the practice of foolish people putting their threads from twisted flax cords, it is a great error: because constriction falls with them beyond quality. 
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And slender threads again are unsuitable: because you do not achieve through constriction with them what you wish.  
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger between star and star. 
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the weak person is injured through the extremities of the stars after constriction in healthy places: then put under them from soft tow, or carded wool, until nothing is injured from it. 
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is a fracture with a wound, and disruption occurs in the skin, I will come with remembrance of it in the second chapter singularity.  
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured limb ought to be constricted with stars from the first day. 
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	For which is because when the limb is large, it is not necessary that you place stars upon it except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the event of hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, with which the ancients restored, which are placed upon fracture and dislocation. 
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	Method of a common shortened plaster, restoring fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women, and boys: because it is from it on account of which neither heat nor cold overcomes.  
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, that you take from the powder of a mill, and it is the marrow of flour which hangs in the walls of the mill at the motion of the millstone: and you make it just as it is, except that you sift it with bran: and put its confection neither thick nor thin. 
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.  
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Method of another Plaster, restoring fracture, and dislocation, and torsion. 
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almonds, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugwort; and juice of all, each ten drachms, myrrh and aloes each five drachms and alethil twenty drachms, let all be ground and sifted, and mix with alethil water. Or with egg white if the complexion of the patient is heated. 
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster. 
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and it benefits many people.  
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	A different method for a plaster, which also benefits fractures and dislocations. 
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugwort, mess, and white alteae, all ten drachms each, myrrh and aloes both five drachms each, acacia six drachms, armenian bole twenty drachms, grind all together thoroughly, sift them, and make them into a plaster with water or egg white.  And apply it.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method for a plaster for joints and separated bones from their places; and it eases pain that occurs to them, and bone division, and fracture.  
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take boiled wool and submerge it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it on the area. 
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good for easing a hot abscess and expels pain properly.  
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A method for a plaster which restores a broken bone. 
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of the deaf fig and leaves of wild poppy; grind all together and make a plaster from both. 
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A shortened method for a plaster administered for the restoration of a bone fracture; and when you want the resolution of remaining abscesses. 
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take root of altaea, chamomile, violet flowers, and herb flour, all equal parts; grind all together and make them into a plaster with wine if the limb is not heated.  
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	But if it is heated then make it with humid coriander water or with water and use it. 
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A stronger method for a plaster to resolve this [first] one is when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb. 
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take equal parts of the root of althea, flaxseed, balaustium, melilot, samsuck, violets flowers, and chamomile. Grind all together, and make them into a paste with willow water, or sweet water, or wine. 
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of this according to the heat of the limb and the rest of its warmth.  
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration except a plaster made from wax and oil; nothing else; and he narrated that it should be a medium between thickness and thinness.  
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen thought that things should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration which have a drying effect of heat, such as myrrh, aloes and frankincense, and similar ones from those we have mentioned. 
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of a plaster that brings together injury and pain. 
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take equal parts of mugwort, chickpea flour, human hair clippings or bird feathers, althea and salt; grind and sift them, and make a plaster from it. 
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity of this plaster, by which the bandage should remain, then be loosened, is such that you consider whether it does not happen to the weak pain, nor itching, nor the fractured bone moves from its place; then do not loosen it for many days. 
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if intense itching occurs to him in that place, or disturbing pain, or swelling; then hurry and loosen it in an hour, and remove the plaster from him; and take a soft cloth, or a soft, moist marine sponge. Submerge it in warm water and wash the place with it until the itching subsides and the pain settles. 
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour. 
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it wool cut up, dipped in vinegar and oil, or rose oil; and bind it on for one night, until you are safe from hot abscesses, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed. 
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat it to a subtle stricture, and a small plaster; and do not constrict it with your first constriction, and subtle with it, until it is healed. 
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	And if you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all accidents are now removed altogether, and it no longer needs a plaster and constriction, then repeat it as you did at first equally. 
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	And if nothing of those things which we have said should happen to the limb, then do not untie it except after three days, or four, or five, or seven. 
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when that whole thing is dismissed for twenty days, according to what appears to you from the loosening of the limb, as we said, until when the fracture adheres, and the coagulation of flesh approximates upon it: add also then in constriction more than your entire first constriction; and add also in thickness of food for the weak, according to its previous remembrance. 
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture already drying out, and wasting more than it should: then know that nourishment is prohibited from reaching it. 
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore embrocate it with warm water at every time that you untie it, and let it be so in all three days, and relieve the constriction a little. 
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation therefore nourishment runs to the limb, and heals quickly. 
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which foolish restorers do from a fracture of a limb with another vice, when it is not restored at first according to what is necessary, and is restored according to tortuosity: this is an error from their operation, and great fear; and if it were right, the ancients would have said it in their books, and they would have operated with it. 
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen any trace of them there at all, and it is better that it not be done. 
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the making of an accidental wound on the head. 
Caput III.	Chapter III.  
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The kinds of fracture are diverse, and its shapes are many; and its causes are distinct. 
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture which occurs from a blow with a sword; and the blow removes the entire mouth until it reaches the syaphne, which is under the bone, just as an axe does to wood; and on account of this, this kind of fracture is called Axial. 
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a sword strikes a certain bone, and strikes its face, and the incision does not penetrate to its very end; and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Elevation absolute.  
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And a wound may be of two fractures, either large or small. 
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture which is comminution, or attrition; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone, or things similar to these.  
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the panniculus, which is under the bone; or it is in the face of the bone; and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.  
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone to the subtlety of a hair; and it is a small fissure, and on account of this, this kind of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from them is a fracture which occurs from a fall or a blow with a stone, and things similar to these, which cause a sheet of bone to enter inwards; and a cavity is formed in its place; just as it happens to bellows of air, when they are struck by a blow, and a part of them enters inwards. 
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this very often occurs in the heads of moist bones, such as are the heads of children. 
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fractures are separated dislocations, and I will come with a recollection of the whole in its place. 
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these kinds of fractures by examination upon them, and inquiry into them with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh which are upon them. 
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillary kind, however, is recognized by this, that it is detected upon the bone, and it is removed and smoothed upon it with a cautery; for the fracture appears black. 
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the accidents of the patient; then if you see from the accidents that it signifies with manifest meaning upon fear, such as vomiting cholera, extension, and loss of intellect, and abscission of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and egress of eyes, and redness of them, and similar things to these accidents in many constitutions, without a doubt it does not heal; and if you see the accidents are not terrifying to you, and you hope for salvation; then begin its treatment.  
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	Which is, if a wounded person comes to you first when wounded; and it is that in the winter days, then it is necessary for you to study in the removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition. 
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary for you to hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from the fatty tissue is corrupted, and those accidents occur which we have recounted. 
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	Which if the fracture of the bone has already reached the fatty tissue touching the brain, and it is with small pieces, and attraction; then it is necessary for you to cut into the comminuted and crushed part according to what I narrate to you. 
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is for you to shave the head of the wounded person; and expose it upon the bone according to whatever way is possible for you; and according to the shape of the wound and what is light upon the sick person. 
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If you encounter a flow of blood or a hot abscess at the exposure of bone, then oppose it with what is necessary. 
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, that you fill the place with cloths dipped in wine and rose oil; and make the wound rest, until the abscess subsides, and you are secure from the flow of blood. 
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the care of the bone, and its removal.  
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one of two methods. 
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is to cut the bone with a sharp-edged Incisor; and this is its form.  
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another Incisor after the Incisor, slightly wider than it; and this is its form. 
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then apply yet another Incisor, even wider than the second. 
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you have a number of diverse Incisors; some of which are wider than others, and some of them shorter than others; and that they be in ultimate sharpness at their extremities, and be made from tempered iron or steel; and use facility in percussion upon the Incisor, so that it does not strike the head, and injure it. 
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is strong and hard, then it is necessary that you pierce around its circumference, before you apply the Incisors, with Awls which are called non-penetrating Awls; and they are not so named unless because they do not pass through the end of the bone into the flesh beyond it; therefore, because the Awl has a rounded extremity above that which is below its pointed head, similar to a rim, and a small circle prevents submerging and passing through the thickness of the bone.  
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it behooves you to take a great number of these Awls, each of which suits the quantity of thickness of the bone, until there is present to you an Awl for every skull; whose pointed extremity in length and shortness is according to the quantity of thickness of that skull. 
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of augers, or trepans. 
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of perforating in a circle around the broken bone is: to place the auger upon the bone and revolve it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated. 
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then transfer the auger to another place and put between each hole a quantity of thickness equal to the radius, or thereabouts. 
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors what is between each hole from the bone and make it thinner than you can on top of it from the point of lightness, as we said, until you remove the bone either with your hand or with some other instrument that you have prepared for it such as forceps and fine pincers. 
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you take all care that the auger or incisor does not touch anything of the spinal cord.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	Therefore, when you have gone around the bone perforating and it has been separated from the spinal cord, if it was continuous with it, and you have removed it, it is necessary that you scrape and equalize its extremity which remains in the bone with another similar instrument like an incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thinner and more subtle than other incisors. 
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	And if anything remains of small bones and splinters, then take them with ease with what you have from your instruments. 
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then take care of the wound after that with linens and ointments as we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy and far removed from fear which Galen spoke of and praised with great praise and this is his speech. 
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin to expose the part of bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and manifest until when you have exposed that part, and placed under it the extremity of this lenticular incisor, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lentil-shaped part, being smooth, does not strike anything; and its sharp part on both sides thereof extending in length, as you see: so that the lentil-shaped part is attached to the bone, its face striking acutely upon the bone. 
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike upon the Incisorium on one side with a small mallet until you have cut through the whole bone easily, as it turns; and you should be safe from the pouch, so that no accident may happen therein which you fear at all. 
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant thereof, nor were he sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the pouch in some places, he would cut it off therefrom with the extremity of the lentil-shaped part of the instrument itself, and free it therefrom easily. 
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed therefrom without harm and without fear.  
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the pouch, and that which is cut off from the bone is its surface, and roughness and subtle burrs remain therein: then it is necessary that you should plane away that roughness, and eradicate those burrs with fine rasps out of which you have prepared a number of diverse sizes, so that it may be possible for you to administer from them in every place the more suitable ones thereof, and straighter ones of them, according to that to which your operation leads you, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.  
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you should administer in your reasoning, by which you first plane the bone, the wider ones of those rasps.  
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after that a finer one. 
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing that continuously until you arrive at administering the thinnest and most delicate of them all.  
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	But in every one of the remaining small fissures, capillary ones, and subtle fractures, it is necessary that you should administer care according to that which leads to its rectification.  
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing which is not hidden from anyone who has any study in this art, and it stood upon what we have written and shown in large fractures. 
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the exposed subcutaneous tissue is retained when you remove the bone, then it is necessary that you take linen cloth, according to the amount of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. 
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as easily as you can over that, so that it does not press upon the bone.  
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a broad bandage over it; and do not tighten it except by the amount that holds the wound only; and leave it with this care for one day or two days until you are secure from hot abscess. 
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then untie it and administer afterward medicines with which there is superfluous dryness: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and those like them; and it is that you make a powder from these medicines, which is sprinkled over the wound as they are dry.  
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And generally administer to it all medicine of a property which is to cleanse and not bite. 
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware according to your ability that the wound in your care is clear; and there is neither dirt of ointment nor filthiness in it. 
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor allow pus to gather in it at all; for when pus gathers over the cerebral tissue, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and there occurs a great evil upon the sick afterward; and this already happens in the skull when bone is removed from it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness appears on its surface. 
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider then if accidents happen to the sick which we have said, know that they are undoubtedly pernicious. 
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make it black: then it is necessary that you take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and lines with them a cloth. 
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it upon the wound; afterwards care for it with the kinds of treatments which are suitable until it is healed.  
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is broken. 
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV. 
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken except for its two upper parts together, or one of them; because it consists of two bones: since the lower part of it is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and nothing happens to it except attrition, twisting, and bruising.  
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is broken, then it is necessary that you insert a small finger into the nostril and equalize that fracture with your index finger and thumb from outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and let this be done with skill and ease.  
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And take care that during your operation there does not occur excessive pain upon the weak part. 
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it: then it is necessary that you equalize it with the end of a radius, in which there is a small thickness. 
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	But if the fracture is in both parts, then do as described above; and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible. 
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day near rest and a warm compress.  
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the extremity of the nose a linen wick if the fracture is in one part; or insert two wicks if the fracture is in both parts: and let the thickness of the wick be such a quantity that it fills the nostril.  
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said to infuse the wicks in butter and change them every day. 
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	It does not seem to me, rather it is necessary, that licorice be poured into the albuginea, having been made with flour of mill. 
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let the licorice be left until the mouth is strengthened and the cartilage hardens. 
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is introduced into the Nose in place of licorice, after it is covered with a soft cloth; and it happens that it holds the fracture of the Nose more strongly, and so that the weak one is not prevented from inhaling. 
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this thing is not necessary. 
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, do licorice. 
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	But if it should happen that the Nose breaks again while you are working, apply a plaster to the nose with carrot, or with quince infused in rose oil, or a little from dyakelon.  
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that plasters be made with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with albuginea. 
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put a soft stopper over it, and do not bind the Nose at all with anything.  
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the bones of the Nose are broken with a small fracture, or are crushed, then it is necessary that you split them open and remove them with instruments that suit them. 
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then suture the incision and treat it with what heals and consolidates with suitable plasters or ointments.  
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	But if a wound should happen between the Nose, then it is necessary that you treat it with licorice; and administer a tube of lead until it heals. 
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jawbone, when it is broken.  
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jawbone is broken and its fracture is not with a wound: then look to see if its fracture is only outward, and it is not broken into two, and curves inward; then the recognition of it is easy. 
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore it is necessary, if the fracture of it is on the right side, that you insert the index finger of your left hand into the mouth of the infirm person: similarly if the fracture is in the left jawbone, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and press with it the gibbosity of the fracture inwards with ease to the exterior with your other hand from the inner part of the bone, and equalize it with it. 
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	But if the fracture of the jawbone has already been separated into two, then it is necessary that you apply extension from both parts, according to straightness: until its equalization is possible. 
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	But if it happens that there is concussion or disruption in the teeth: then bind those of which you hope that they will remain with gold, silver, or silk thread. 
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a cerecloth over the fractured jawbone. 
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth over it, and put a large, well-made star over the cloth: or a piece of tanned sole leather equal in length to the jawbone. 
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it on top, according to how its bandage is prepared for you, and it suits its application until it is not destroyed: and instruct the infirm person that he keep quiet and still: and have his food be gentle sips. 
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you judge that something is already altered in some way: then hurry and loosen it on the third day. 
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from it, and plaster it with powder of millstone grit, with lime or with sesame flour, after you have removed the cerecloth: and put soft wool over the plaster. 
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached to it, and the bone arrangement is not altered, leave it alone, do not loosen it until it heals: or bind the fracture. 
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	Very often this fracture is bound for three weeks.  
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	But if a hot abscess should happen in the meantime, then administer what we have often said in its calming, until that abscess is removed. 
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if there is a fracture with a wound, consider it. 
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For since a fragment is now separated from the bone, or by a saw; then carefully attend to this, so that you remove those fragments of the saw with what suits you in their removal from instruments. 
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a phlebotomy according to the amount of your need. 
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those saw fragments, and nothing remains of them, suture the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place a plaster suitable for it on top of it, and let it grow together until it heals.  
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Concerning the Restoration of the Collarbone When It Is Broken. 
Caput VI.	Chapter Six. 
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The Collarbone is indeed very often broken from the front part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs according to one of three ways. 
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For it is either broken and separated into two, besides which saw fragments may occur; and this is easier to restore. 
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or so that saw fragments occur in the bone; and this is more difficult to restore.  
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or so that there is a fracture with a wound. 
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation on it when the fracture is without a wound is that you have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the support following the broken Collarbone, and the other extends the neck towards the side. 
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until its form is made as it ought to be; and there should be neither eminence nor concavity in it.  
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If it needs more extension, then you must place a sphere of cloth or wool under the collarbone of the weak patient; and its size should be according to the amount of your need; extend and elevate the Collarbone, and compress the sphere with your hand until you equalize the fracture as needed.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the extremity of the Furcula outward because it has reached a depth, then it is necessary that the infirm person be laid on his back and a medium-sized cushion be placed under his shoulder; and let the attendant press his shoulder downward until the os of the Furcula which is deep is raised upward; and then straighten the fracture and equalize it with your fingers. 
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	But if you perceive a splinter from the Furcula, and it moves, then you must cut above it and extract the splinter easily. 
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	But if it is retained in the bone, then apply ingenuity in incising it with one of the forceps which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the Furcula an instrument that preserves the sifach; and this instrument is made of wood or iron. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon which has no concavity.  
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that for which you need it from the size of the bone and its parity. 
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, also as much as is possible for you in the operation. 
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two extremities, as you see: and one extremity be wide and the other narrow. 
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	But if the disruption of the wound which you opened when you extracted the bone splinter is wide, and you are cautious of hot abscesses; then join the two lips of the wound with sutures. 
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small or you fear hot abscesses; then fill the wound with cloths and lint according to the quantity of the wound's fissure. 
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	But if a hot abscess should occur, then infuse a cloth in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place it upon it. 
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	But when the stricture of the bone is without a wound and without incision it is, as you place upon the bone a plaster made from miller's flour with egg white. 
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft pledget over it. 
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its nipple, if it needs that. 
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long: and let its width be a palm, or thereabouts. 
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled pledget over the pledget and plaster. 
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length. 
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth. 
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the splint in the place of the alhimemati which falls over the fracture and place.  
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alhimemati over the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it over its neck, and under its sound nipple, and under its unsound nipple: and draw it over all parts, and how you see that the strapping holds the fracture with decent strapping: and this is, that which is not hidden from you, and the whole, so that the splint does not move off the fractured bone. 
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this it is necessary, that you look at the sick person every day. 
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever therefore the ligature is softened, and you see the splint already moving: then straighten that, and tighten the ligature.  
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person's sleep on its back, and put under its nipple at its sleep a small cushion at night, so that it may be raised with it as assistance from its side.  
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the clavicle is therefore raised by raising the shoulder. 
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind its arm to its neck: and do not loosen the ligature unless it should happen in the place an accident from itching, or from an abscess, up to twelve days. 
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see its face towards it.  
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And bind it tight and let it go until it is restored and coagulates. 
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed a fracture of the clavicle is bound and strengthened for the most part in twenty-eight days, and sometimes it happens in some people in a lesser time. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of a scapula fracture. 
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The scapula is rarely broken, and in its broad part; and its margins are not broken except from it. 
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	Therefore, when a place is broken from it and broken in its middle, and it is not recognized except by touch; then, according to what the fracture figure is, try its preparation. 
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural shape in every way possible for you. 
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place powder of mill with egg white on the site, and a soft pledget, and put a poultice from doubled cloth over it. 
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place a broad splint from a thin board according to the quantity of the whole scapula, or a little wider. 
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	But if there is a concavity under the splint in any part of the scapula, then equalize it with a soft pledget until the splint descends according to equality. 
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind over it with a long bandage, with decent constriction and firmness of the splint so that it is not removed from its place. 
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligature every day. 
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever therefore the bandage softens, bind it, and equalize the splint if it is removed from its place; and let the weak person lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And indeed the scapula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days. 
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is completed, then untie the bandage and you will be safe.  
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose union is not feared, nor their loosening.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If, however, a fragment proceeds from the bone and pricks under the skin: then split above it and remove it. 
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the clavicle from the calming of a hot abscess, if anything should happen from it. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the restoration of a breastbone fracture. 
Caput VIII.	Chapter Eight. 
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone is sometimes fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens. 
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities indeed are most often broken and crushed from accidents. 
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is fractured, which inclines downwards, and there occurs to it intense pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps he vomits blood, and a concavity is shown in the broken bone, and is not hidden from the sense; The restoration of it is that the sick person be laid on his back; and put pulvinar between his spatulas. 
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders and join the ribs from both sides or parts with hands; and make it equal with subtlety, according to every way that it is possible and suits, until the figure of the bone returns, according to what is necessary.  
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put plaster and a wad over it, and put a splint from thin wood from willow, or elder, and such like in lightness on top of it, after you have wrapped it in cloth. 
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then make subtlety in binding it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and go with a bandage according to its roundness to the back many times, and constrict it with decent tightness. 
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it; and if its need provokes to loosen it at itching or corruption which occurs in the place or pain or abscess: then hurry and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and rectify what happens with a method of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then apply a plaster if you see that it is fitting for it and add a bandage to it until it heals. 
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the Restoration of Ribs, When They Are Broken. 
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in thick places which follow the back and from their extremities on the front side. 
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And attrition does not happen to them unless it is because they are cartilaginous. 
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the senses upon inquiry with the fingers. 
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way that you equalize the fracture with your fingers as much as possible until the shape is equalized, according to what is necessary. 
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters and bind the broken bone with splints if it needs it.  
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inward: then there occurs severe pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing sensation that occurs to one who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and he also experiences difficulty breathing and coughing, and vomiting blood frequently; and this is difficult to cure. 
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have already devised many remedies for it, and among them are those who say that you should give the patient foods which produce inflammation and windiness so that the abdomen becomes inflamed and extended, and the fracture is pushed outward. 
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We, however, forbid it lest a hot abscess be quickly made if it does not already exist.  
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already occurred, then it adds to it. 
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: place something windy on top of the spot, and then suck it out with force, and this is similar reasoning. 
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the windiness will attract superfluities to the spot because of the weakened condition.  
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been soaked in warm oil: and poultices should be placed between the ribs until it is filled so that there will be an equal bandage when you wrap it according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then let the weak patient be treated for pleurisy with diet and medicine. 
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If a strong matter constricts the patient, which he cannot bear, and pricks the mouth with piercing membrane, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary that we cleave over the place and expose the broken rib. 
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place upon it an instrument which retains the silk, a remembrance of which has preceded; and let us cut open the mouth with ease, and cut it itself. 
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us join together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture; and let us treat it with plasters until it heals. 
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	But if a hot abscess should happen at the same time, then hurry and pour little poultices in rose oil and put them on the spot; and let the patient be treated with that which suits an abscess.  
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile also let him lie supine upon the side upon which he sleeps until it heals. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.  
Caput X.	Chapter 10. 
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed a fracture sometimes happens to the bones of the neck, and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly to the vertebrae of the back also. 
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	Therefore when it happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not: then consider. 
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened and stunned and dead; and he cannot move them nor extend them nor constrict them; and when you constrict them with your fingers, and prick them with a sharp point, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and is mortal in most dispositions. 
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them and feels constriction in them with fingers and pricking: then know that the vertebrae of the neck are safe, and that the patient will be healed with treatment. 
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it should happen with a spinal injury like that, and you wish to know whether it will be healed or not: then consider its feet; then if you see that they have become softened, and there occurs in them what occurs in the hands; then when he lies on his back, flatulence and defecation exit without volition; and when he is turned over onto his stomach, defecation exits without volition; and when he is turned over onto his back again, and he wishes to urinate but cannot: then know that it is mortal. 
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not labor in its treatment. 
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if none of that happens to him, the matter is lighter. 
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of what happens from that is, to try sedative fomentations of hot poultice: so that you place on the fractured spine rose oil alone: or with yolks well cooked. 
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place on it that several times a day until when the hot poultice is sedated: then place on the place one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it over it with a bandage: and order the sick person to use quietude and tranquility. 
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the side on which he finds pain until he is healed. 
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	But if it should happen at the abrasion of bone that is shattered, or something which already becomes separated from it: then it is necessary that you cut upon the skin and remove that.  
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with suture. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some flesh-producing substance, from ointments, until it is healed.  
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	But if the last bone of the coccyx is fractured and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary that you insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus and equalize the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible, and by a second equalization. 
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it on top and remove it, and care for the wound with the care that preceded it until it heals. 
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the Restoration of a Wound. 
Caput XI.	Chapter Eleven. 
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely are the bones of a wound broken. 
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	But if they are broken, then their fracture is not anything but a comminution at their ends; and they split lengthwise and incline towards the inside; and there occurs a feeble pain in the place, and stinging; and the leg which is broken becomes numb. 
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration indeed is that you extend your hand over it until you stand over the fracture as its shape is.  
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	But if the fracture is only at its ends, then equalize that fracture according to what is prepared for you from equality until it resembles its natural shape. 
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is lengthwise or has already inclined inwards, then make the weak person lie on their stomach until preparation for the restoration of that fracture is ready for you. 
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	Therefore, when you equalize it, place a plaster over it; then place a splint made of wood or leather over it; and bind it tight with a binding which you do not fear will cause the fracture to change position or the splint to be removed. 
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of those with something which fills it until the binding takes it according to equality; and order the weak person to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.  
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if a hot abscess should occur to it; then stop from extending it and its restoration until the hot abscess subsides; and place what subsided over it according to what preceded, then return to its restoration; and bind it as is necessary. 
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if a bone becomes loose or breaks apart, remove it.  
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Assistant Bone 
Caput XII.	Chapter Twelve 
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	That is an assistant, which is between the elbow and the head of the spatula. 
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	Therefore, if it is broken, its restoration is according to one of two methods. 
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows. 
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligatures are tied at the two ends. 
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from an elevated place, and the patient sits upon a seat.  
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should project his broken arm onto the wood until it reaches its middle, in which the curve of the wood is attached. 
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy from above it so that it extends the whole thing downwards.  
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician straightens the fracture with his hands at the same time until the fracture returns as it should be. 
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other method is that the patient lies on his back and his hand is suspended from his neck with a ligature. 
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants, that one of them should hold that which is above the fracture with his hands and that the other should hold below it; and let each one extend towards their own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with a ligature and above it with another ligature; and let each of the two assistants extend them towards their own two sides. 
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder, it is necessary that one ligature be placed below the head and another below the fracture towards the elbow.  
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, it is necessary that a ligature be placed above that place and above the elbow itself. 
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then straighten the fracture with ease without exertion until when the fracture is equalized as it should be and a good dressing is applied; then bind it if a hot swelling does not occur. 
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs, then loosen the bandage until the seventh day. 
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it wool dipped in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides; then bind it. And the manner of binding it is to place a plaster over the fracture. 
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place an application from new cloth over the plaster. 
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then let him bind his arm upon the support and place his open hand upon his shoulder. 
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth and bind it upon the support so that the arm remains in the place of the stars; if nothing prevents you from doing so, nor anything changes over the broken bone. 
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if you fear that something might change over the broken bone, then use a splint; and it is to place upon the fracture itself a splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints. 
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place the width of a finger between every splint; and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side. 
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind upon the splints the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. 
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your bandage be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the longer the fracture extends, the looser the bandage should be. 
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	Therefore, if you see the position of the splints and bandage, as we have said, in the hour that you restore the limb immediately do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then loosen the bandage and splints until the seventh day, as we have said. 
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the bandage every three days so that itching or swelling does not occur in the place, nor is food prevented from reaching the limb because of the abundance of the bandage. 
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct it all according to what we have said. 
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are confident that nothing will happen from it; then do not loosen the bandage except after three days or more. 
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	Let the sick man lie on his back and let his hands be upon his stomach; and put under him a bolster filled with wool evenly. 
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened, or that the ligament is not softened. 
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore rectify it all with your strength. 
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And put food for the sick man according to the order which we have prescribed, so that it be subtle food at first until he begins to bind his mouth; then it is necessary that you thicken his food.  
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For by custom of the helper and leg it is to be bound for forty days; then therefore it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath be given, and be treated with ointments which rectify it.  
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	But if the fracture is foul and crushed; then do not loosen from it the bandage and splints for up to fifty days, and even up to two months. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Concerning the Restoration of a Fracture of the Arm. 
Caput XIII.	Chapter Thirteen.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones which are called two humeri. 
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small and it is that which follows the thumb.  
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Therefore perhaps only the larger humerus is broken, or the smaller one; and perhaps they are broken together. 
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller humerus above is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower humerus is broken, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult. 
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse is it when the two bones are broken together.  
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone which is broken is the smaller humerus above, then it behooves the doctor at its restoration to put a small extension with ease until it equals itself. 
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If, however, the large bone is fractured: then it is necessary that he should apply a stronger splint. 
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he should apply the shape of the hand at its restoration, and its extended extension upon a cushion. 
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers towards the superiors: and let the lower joint be lower than all the fingers, or the rest: and a weak sitting square upon itself, and let the cushion be before it, or in its direction, at a height, so that the weak one does not incur labor. 
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the attendant extend the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with a ligament. 
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And let another attendant extend similarly from above. 
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then let the physician equalize the bone, until he reduces it according to the best shape that he can.  
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	And if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then endeavor to reduce all fragments into their place by your strength.  
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	But if a separated splinter appears in it and pricks the skin, and you have no hope of its restoration: then cut upon it, and remove it according to the way that we said in those things which are preceding. 
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter for that, therefore take its treatment from there. 
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	But if a hot abscess should happen at the beginning of your restoration, then make a cloth with cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and subtlety: and bind the cloth upon it with a fine bandage, until the abscess subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from flour powder with egg white.  
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place stars, and let the star which is placed upon the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of stars for the arm is six in most arrangements: whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones at the same time. 
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage over the place of the fracture stronger and more tightly, and somewhat higher with the bandage above the fracture, or below it; or place a softer bandage on the same side, according to the previous recollection mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. 
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths which are wrapped over the fracture be soft, damp cloths; and not hard, rough ones. 
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is tied be of flax properly, medium between fine and coarse, as we have described. 
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the bandage after a few days. 
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	And if anything should happen of which correction is necessary, such as itching which occurs in the limb: then it is necessary that you bathe the limb with warm water until the itching subsides, and you release the limb unconstrained until it subsides, then repeat the bandage. 
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	And if the bandage has already become softened, and the bone already moved, and similar things to these: then correct all that by your own skill, and consider again. 
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of excess bandage, then it is necessary that you soften it a little, and release it for several days until nourishment flows to it, then tighten it. 
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if none of the things which we have said happen to the weak one, then it is not necessary that it be loosened except after twenty days, or thereabouts. 
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the weak one's hand be suspended to his neck.  
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be equal, and let it be guarded by his own strength from agitated movements. 
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.  
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days. 
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of that is according to the dispositions of complexions, and dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the Restoration of Fractures of the Hand 
Caput XIIII.	Chapter Fourteen
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures of the ribs of the hand and the knuckles of the fingers rarely occur. 
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to them unless there is much rubbing. 
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, when a fracture or rubbing of the sole occurs, it is necessary for the weakling to sit down and for there to be a seat in front of him according to equality. 
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on it extended. 
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the attendant extend the broken bones, and let the physician equalize them until they are joined together in a good conjunction. 
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to place a plaster and wad if a hot abscess does not occur.  
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint on top according to the quantity of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth. 
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is near the belly of the sole, then make a sphere-like thing from cloth and order the weakling to press upon it with his fractured sole; then let it be tied with a long cloth. 
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the splint be made from leather, in which there is softness so that the leather may be applied to the body of the sole; and bind it as needed.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is on the outside, it is necessary to place a splint on top and another splint from beneath in the sole; and let the hand be open and straight. 
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put a bandage, as the hand is turned over; and extend between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	But if it happens that a fracture occurs to any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, equalize it as needed. 
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with the sole; and if you wish, place a small straight splint for it so that the fracture may be raised and not moved. 
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle finger, index finger, or ring finger and little finger, then equalize it and bind it with the healthy finger that follows it; or let them all be bound according to continuity, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small plaster on it, as we said for the thumb. 
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the placement of the hot poultice: and oppose it with what is necessary when something occurs from it, according to as its account is repeated. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Restoration of a Hip Fracture. 
Caput XV.	Chapter Fifteen.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often fractured, and it is revealed to the senses because it turns to the inner and rear part. 
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in such a way that a ligature is tightened above the fracture, and another ligature below the fracture. 
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient should lie face down. 
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then let the minister extend all the ligatures to their proper side according to equality: and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let the ligature be on the side of the pectineal muscle so that the extension falls upward: and another ligature below the fracture. 
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligature be near the knee so that the extension is downward. 
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then let the physician equalize the bone with both of his hands until he reduces it according to the likeness of the natural shape: and let the bone be joined with a good conjunction.  
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you place a plaster and bandage, if an abscess does not occur in the limb. 
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess occurs in it: then let it alone for several days until the hot abscess subsides, then return to your treatment.  
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage of it should be thus. 
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap a hard linen cloth, that is, a bandage, over the fracture; and double it twice, or three times: and let there be a surplus from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the root of the ankle. 
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts. 
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the leg and thigh what is left over from the splint. 
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the thigh in the place of the fracture itself splints, and place one splint from them over the bone of the leg. 
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the vacancies between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the tightness is equal. 
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with strong binding from the middle above the place of the fracture with three or four windings. 
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you extend with the bandage from the place of the fracture, let your binding be less and softer, and gentler. 
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then attend to the two ends of the thread which you inserted between the thigh and the leg. 
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore tie with both three splints which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the heel of the foot. 
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both tighten also the ends of the splints from the other side, so that the bandage is not removed from its place. 
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then let the binding remain on it as long as it stays, so that neither corrosion nor abscess nor swelling nor anything like them happen to the limb. 
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	But if something of that kind should happen.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore hurry with its resolution and correct everything that happens from it completely, according to what we have said many times.  
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if there is a fragment of bone in the bone that pierces: then it is necessary, if it is possible for you, to equalize that. 
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, bind over it and remove it; and care for it with a memory of what preceded, until it heals. 
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is held together, in addition to which stars are added to it, as we said in the auxiliary and arm. 
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in its restoration thus fractured, infirm lameness does not occur. 
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, except that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he who owns it always limps. 
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is held together for fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is diminished: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions, and other dispositions.  
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap. 
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but attrition often happens to it. 
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	But if a fracture does occur to it, then it is nothing but either a fissure or a hole in its parts.  
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is that with a wound, and without a wound. 
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And the whole thing stands upon it with sensation. 
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that what is disrupted from its parts is equalized with the fingers until it comes together and is joined according to what is possible from equality and ease and fabrication. 
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster from sesame flour, or millstone, with egg white: and place a round star on top of it if that is needed: and bind a suitable ligature on top of it for that. 
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions which we have narrated in the other fractures: such as a hot poultice, and things similar to it: so that you oppose every accident with what suits it until it is healed.  
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a fracture of the leg. 
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick and is called by the name Leg: and the other slender and is called Fibula. 
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens with both kinds of fractures that it happens to two bones of the arm; and for this reason, its restoration is done just like the restoration of an arm equally, and the operation is one. 
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones are broken at the same time, the leg is turned in all directions. 
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a slender bone is broken, the leg is turned to the front part. 
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a thicker bone is broken, you will find it below; and it is among those that are not hidden from you. 
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then apply extension, and equalization, and ligation of the stars according to that equally.  
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it is necessary, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having many splinters: that there be less extension, and gentler alleviation by you.  
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something more from the operation than in the arm; and it is that when you equalize the stars, and complete all your operation, then take two bandages from pine wood, which is administered in the making of sun dials that are put under boards; and they are made from palm spatulas; and choose from them those which have a small thickness, and are not from the smallest ones: and let the length of them be according to the length of the leg from the knee downward.  
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap upon each cloth with two wrappings according to its length. 
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And put one part of the leg from one side, and the other from the other side; and let them be from the knee downward to the foot. 
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two bandages in three places from the two ends and the middle.  
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when constriction is forbidden, the leg inclines to the right and left, and stands in a good position. 
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed let a crib be administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it preserves it from motion. 
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed it is very necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is a wound with it properly. 
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day and strive with the greatest care to keep it free from abscess, or swelling, or other things. 
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If, therefore, any of those things should happen, then oppose them with what is necessary until it is healed, if God wills. 
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of fractures of the bones of the foot and toes. 
Caput XVIII.	Chapter Eighteen. 
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture of the heel bone does not often occur. 
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	Fractures sometimes happen to the bones of the foot and rarely to the toes; they do not occur except by attrition in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	And if a fracture should happen to the bones of the foot and you see those bones rise up over one another, then let the patient place his foot on prepared ground, as if walking. 
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand and place your foot on that which is raised from those bones; then press or tread it down and equalize it until it returns to its place. 
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster and put a splint over it; and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a proper bandage after you have wrapped it in cloths and other things as needed. 
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When three or four days have passed, then untie the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones equalized, whether they were broken or dislocated.  
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation on them is therefore as you see. 
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if any of the toes are broken, then restore them and equalize them according to what I have told you about the restoration of the fingers of the hand. 
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place with your finger a splint along the length of the toe and let it be a little wider; then place under the foot this board which I have told you about, and bind it with a proper bandage. 
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If, however, what is broken is two, three, or more bones, then place upon each finger a splint of its size, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board under the foot; and let it stand on one head of the board outside the belly of the foot, so that it may hold with good retention. 
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it behooves you not to forget to consider all that I have said to you in the remaining fractures from the accidents we mentioned; and oppose every accident with what is necessary. 
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the bone of the breastbone, and the man's penis bone.
Caput XIX.	Chapter Nineteen. 
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit squarely. 
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her somewhat toward her own back, and let her be held back. 
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton until it is full; and let it be made in the vulva like a sphere from this. 
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For the cotton will come out until it is made before the vulva's gate like a sphere, and the broken bone returns. 
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a cushion upon her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When, therefore, she wishes to urinate, let her remove the cotton with ease, then urinate; and put it back according to the manner in which you first inserted it; then let her return to her first cushion. 
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself is restored.  
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a bladder of a sheep, and bind a reed tube over its opening; and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.  
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated within the vulva, for the fracture returns. 
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it should be filled with cotton and left for several days, as we have said, until it heals. 
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the breastbone of a man or woman is broken, then apply in its restoration and its equalizing that which we have said about the bone of the shoulder blade. 
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum should not be concealed in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone who has some study or practice. 
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine well, for the fracture itself indicates to you in many positions the straight path in its restoration and its union; therefore understand. 
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the rod of a man is broken, take a goose's neck; and insert the rod into it.  
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place an envelopment of cloth over it, and let it be wrapped up, and leave it for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of a fracture of bones when there is a wound. 
Caput XX.	Chapter XX. 
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for one to whom a fracture occurs with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or thigh bone or similar to them, that you hasten and let blood from him immediately; if conditions for bloodletting are attested to you, as we have previously stated. 
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	But if the wound is flowing blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to cut away from it so that you sprinkle powdered charcoal over it; if you do not have anything else present.  
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day and do not delay it unless an abscess occurs. 
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a hot abscess occurs, then defer its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.  
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause bad things to happen to him. 
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If, however, the fractured jawbone is prominent above the skin exposed, then it is necessary that you try to reduce it and equalize it with your hands with ease and little extension. 
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, its extension is not prepared, and its equalization by your hands: then reduce it with this instrument. 
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound. 
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take three or four from them according to the quantity needed for that cure in every kind of fracture.  
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness in it so that it is not doubled upon compression on it in the hour of the operation: and let it have an acute extremity, which has a margin at its extremities. 
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above its thickness from its middle up to its lower parts.  
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape. 
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the acute curved extremity of it be placed on the extremity of the prominent bone and press it with it together until the jaw returns and is equalized in some way.  
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore try to equalize the extremities of the fracture to each other. 
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	And if the extremities of it are fractured finely and do not receive good acceptance by the instrument, then it is necessary that you cut the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it. 
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you are not able to reduce them altogether with what we have described, then cut it with what suits it from the Incisions which we have mentioned or saw it with a saw in whatever way is possible for you. 
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape away that which remains in the bone from roughness and fine cortexes.  
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the jaw is reduced and finds violent vehement pain after its reduction, then you know that the jaw has not returned to its natural place. 
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore do that. 
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you bestow a great benefit on the sick man when you complete the restoration of the bone which you make. 
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in black wine vinegar. 
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is summer. 
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a bandage on the wound which contains wax, nor anything in which there is oil: so that you do not cause putrefaction and decay to occur in it.  
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer splints in the hour of your completion of the restoration of the bone. 
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let the wound be left open; so that you may make an incision with forceps into the folds according to the size of the wound.  
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And be careful with all caution not to constrict the wound with a fracture. 
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For very often foolish doctors have done this, and they have caused death, or decay, or gangrene, that is, a spreading sore, to occur upon their patients.  
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your binding be soft, gentle, different from the binding of other fractures. 
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	But if the wound is bad, or it is a large wound, and you fear some evil accidents which we have described upon it, and you find pain in the place hanging: then it is not necessary that you should put splints upon it. 
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them folds out of hard cloths in place of the splints, and bind it with them. 
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus in it: then remove from on top of it the cloth which you placed upon it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer bandages and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds: such as the tetrapharmacum ointment and those similar to it. 
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it behooves you to loosen the bandage. 
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening until it consolidates and heals.  
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus flows from it to the lower parts with ease. 
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass and the wound does not heal and the pus is not separated from it, then know that there are small bone fragments there. 
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore you must inquire into the wound with your hand. 
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	But however many of those bone fragments are separate, remove them and extract them yourself.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those which are not separate and prick the limb and cause pain to occur, try to cut into them and remove them in any way possible for you to do so. 
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	But if it should happen that the wound becomes infected, or gangrenous, that is, estiomenus, or another species of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary that you oppose to each of these what suits it from its treatment, of which a preceding account was given in its chapter. 
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this point on which my speech must stand and to which you should direct your mind when a bone is broken and protrudes above the limb, such as the thighbone and the fibula and those similar to them from large limbs, it is, that you do not presume to pull it back, for very often death results from this, but rather let it be until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days. 
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore treat the wound if it seems right to you, and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Concerning the treatment of nodules in the scar after a fracture. 
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Very often this nodulation occurs in the scar after healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially that which is near the joints and disfigures the shape of the limb from it. 
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider then if the nodulation is recent, administer to it medicines which have astringency, such as aloes and frankincense and myrrh and sarcocolla and acacia and those similar to them.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you may take some of these, or all of them, and mix them with vinegar, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and lay them upon the swelling on a wad, and bind them tightly over it. 
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the binding, and do not loosen it for many days. 
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another, until the swelling is removed.  
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind a sheet of lead over it firmly. 
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.  
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already turned to stone, and is tight, and urgent necessity calls for its removal: then make an incision over it from its upper part, and cut away the excess that protrudes: or shave it with certain razors, until it is removed; and tend to it until it heals. 
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Concerning the healing when it is restored, and the limb remains beneath it subtle, not according to its nature. 
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII. 
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of a bone is healed, and the limb remains after it subtle, weak; then it does not happen except for many causes. 
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is the multiplicity of loosening of the ligament and its binding not as it should be: or because of excess tightness of the ligaments' bindings, until nourishment is prevented from running to the limb; or because of too much application of embrocations at an unfitting time; or because of scarcity of blood in the body of the weak person, and its debility. 
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its cure is to feed the weak person, and make his body tender, until blood is multiplied in it.  
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath. 
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him. 
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then lay pitch over the limb: so that the pitch may draw much nourishment to it.  
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And diligently apply embrocation of it with warm water, until nourishment flows and it returns to its natural form. 
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crooked. 
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII. 
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that crookedness and eminence of the broken bone, or a knot, occur in a limb already restored after its healing, and the form of the limb is spoiled thereby, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural operation, then you ought not to listen to him who thinks that the limb should be broken again. 
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have already been many foolish physicians and setters who have done this in our land. 
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is truly very blameworthy, leading to death, or great fear, so that it may be mortal. 
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limping and knotting are recent, then it is necessary that it be bathed with warm water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as leaves of the mallow, and its root, and melilot, and those like them. 
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made for it with a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let the mucilage of mallow root be taken and shaken with hen fat, or sesame oil, and plastered with it. 
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let plump figs be taken and rubbed with dove's dung, and similar things which are called from medicines that lessen consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is loosened with persistent, ancient, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands. 
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let motion be given to the limb to every part in all hours.  
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the crookedness has already preceded and become strong, and has been converted into stone, and necessity has arisen for its treatment with iron, then it is necessary that it be cut above it, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and what overflows from the knot or bone be cut off with fine incisors; and ease be given to it with care and diligence.  
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Concerning Speech in Dislocation. 
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV. 
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its place. 
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prohibited from its motion and the figure of the limb is deformed.  
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pains and violent injuries to befall the weak one. 
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when dislocation happens to someone, it is necessary to hasten its restoration and not delay it at all.  
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation with it. 
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it should not be moved nor extended during the hour of its inflammation.  
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes spasms and painful injuries to occur. 
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, you must hurry to the phlebotomy of the weak one. 
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be dismissed until the inflammation subsides.  
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then let the limb be embrocated with warm water and oil. 
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then let it be reduced with ease.  
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And let all the limb be treated with it so that the recollection of which will come to its place. 
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters of dislocation, even according to what preceded in the fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.  
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw. 
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV. 
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws rarely dislocate unless rarely. 
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For either they are moved from their places by a small removal and softened a little.  
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation until they soften to the chest part, until the saliva of the weak one flows and he cannot hold it nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is enveloped with speech. 
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	But when its dislocation is small, then it returns in many positions by itself with little effort. 
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete, entire: then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly and not delayed at all: and it is for the attendant to hold the head of the weak one; and for the physician to insert the thumb of his own hand into the root of the mandible of the dislocation between his mouth, if the dislocation is from one side. 
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts his two thumbs together, if the dislocation is from both sides.  
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And let the remaining fingers of his hands be outside, with which he equalizes. 
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the weak one to cleanse his mandibles and open them for eating on every side.  
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician equalizes the mandible and pushes the mandible until it returns to its place. 
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	And if its reduction is difficult, especially if both mandibles are together; then administer steaming with warm water and oil until an easy reduction of both is made: and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.  
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are equalized and the mouth of the weak one is closed and they do not soften; then place poultices of cloths on them with cerate which is made from wax and rose oil. 
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is bound easily with soft bandages.  
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sleep of the weak one be on his back; and let his head stand between two pillows so that he does not move it to the right and left; nor does he try or is forced to chew anything: but rather let his food be a gentle sipping until when the pains are removed and the mandible is knotted; then let him eat what he wants and let it be administered easily. 
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let him not labor upon the operation of his mouth at eating and drinking and kissing until the mandible is united and healed. 
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	But if the reduction of the two mandibles becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some hour and do not return to their places, then fevers and continuous sweats often happen; and perhaps the belly of the sick person is loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile. 
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore when you see that, know that it is destruction and he to whom it happens often dies in ten days. 
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and extremity of the shoulder.  
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The clavicle indeed does not dislocate from the inner side on account of its continuity with the chest. 
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it sometimes dislocates to the outer side, and that is declared by sensation. 
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, for the sick person to lie on his back and extend his arms.  
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then constrict the place with your palm in a strong constriction, for it will return by itself. 
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put a plaster upon it and poultices, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities indeed which follow the elbow and are continuous with it do not dislocate except rarely. 
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it dislocates on some day, then it is necessary that it be reduced and equalized according to what we have said and what is prepared for you. 
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put a plaster upon it and poultices and a binding.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And advise the sick person to adhere to tranquility and quiet until he heals. 
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the extremity of the shoulder is reduced when it also separates from its place. 
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder.  
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus does not dislocate except according to three ways. 
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of them is to dislocate it towards the side of the fibula below. 
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is to dislocate it towards the chest. 
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it may be dislocated to the upper part of the humerus, and that happens rarely. 
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not dislocate backwards because of the spatula. 
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate forwards because of the nerves. 
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	Indeed, it most often dislocates and comes out below towards the fibula, especially in those whose flesh is scant. 
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it goes out quickly in them and goes back in quickly.  
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is plentiful, it is the opposite of that, namely because it goes out with difficulty and goes back in with difficulty. 
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people that a blow or fall occurs and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot inflammation, and it is thought because of that that it has already been dislocated. 
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you ought to test it until you stand on the certainty of it, and then proceed with its treatment. 
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And dislocation is recognized when it is below towards the fibula, and you distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a sound humerus.  
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a manifest difference between them, and you find in the head of the humerus a concavity, and under the fibula at the touch the head of the humerus as if it were an egg itself: and the weak person cannot bring the hand to his ear, nor move it with all motions.  
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards: then you find a manifest touch and it is not concealed. 
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And the reduction of this dislocation is indeed easy when it is recent or when the person is a weak child.  
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is that the attendant raises his hand upwards. 
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under his clavicle, and elevate the fracture with strength upwards to its place; and let the assistant raise his hand and extend it upwards. 
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him put it down below, for he returns quickly. 
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if he does not return through what we have said, and there have been many days from the beginning since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the sick man bathe in warm water, and an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if the roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot are decocted in water and administered. 
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then let the sick man be laid on his back; and let a sphere and wool be placed under his clavicle, which is equal between softness and firmness. 
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then let the physician place his heel on the sphere, and elevate the head of the humerus with strength, and draw the hand of the sick man downwards. 
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And let another assistant hold the head of the sick man so that it does not move downwards; for he returns immediately. 
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is that you make a man who is taller than the sick man be present, and let him stand on the side, and insert his shoulder under the clavicle of the sick man; and elevate the clavicle upwards until the sick man is suspended in the air. 
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And let another assistant draw the hand of the sick man downwards towards his belly. 
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick man is light: then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else so that he becomes heavy; for the dislocation returns immediately. 
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood be fixed into the ground, whose head is round in shape: such as the handle of a mortar: which is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let it be placed under the sick man after soft cloths are placed on top of the head of the wood; and let the sick man stand according to the length of the wood. 
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then let his hand be extended downwards on one side, and let his body be extended on the other side with force; for the junction returns to its place with speed. 
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	But if its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this care: and it is, that you take wood whose length is the measure of two arms, and its width the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its entry is eased into the depth of the bone, according to this form. 
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied over the round head so that the wood does not injure the weak flesh.  
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then let it be placed under the weak bone so that the hand or arm is extended upon the wood up to the lower parts; and let the wood be tied over the support, the arm, and the end of the hand. 
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then let the arm be placed upon the step of a ladder for its width, and let the hand be extended downwards, and let the remaining body be left hanging from the other side. 
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the junction enters immediately.  
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Therefore when its entry is completed according to whichever way is possible: then it is necessary that you put under the bone a sphere of equal size from wool.  
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a plaster prepared from miller's powder with frankincense and albumin over the whole shoulder, just as it rolls down from above. 
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind under the bone with a decent bandage; and let the bandage be rolled over the plaster from above; and attach his hand to his neck, and let it go, and do not move his hand for seven days. 
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the weak one until the limb is strengthened; for it is quicker for its healing.  
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then let a wider bandage be put on after seven days, or five, and he should be raised with motion. 
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is hardened and is not softened, then it is already healed. 
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the junction dislocates many times, because of the moisture that happens to it or because of another cause: then it is necessary that a cautery with three holes be administered in it, according to what has been previously stated in the chapter on cautery. 
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	But if all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the junction is not confirmed, and the plaster and constriction are returned upon it several times, and it is not made firm, and it falls, and it cannot be raised to the upper parts: then know that its nerves which are at the head of the humerus have already been cut or stretched or softened: and know that the junction will never be fixed in its place. 
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But reduction of the dislocation which occurs towards the chest and nipple, or to the back, is made with a thrust and extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining constriction and care are administered in it until it is healed.  
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	But if it should happen after healing that there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its motion, then let the weak person bathe many times until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its former nature. 
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow. 
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter Twenty-Eight. 
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty also: and indeed it dislocates to all sides and especially to the front or to the back.  
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it falls under sight and under touch, according to whichever shape it dislocates. 
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the sound one, it is declared to you manifestly. 
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint becomes concave and the arm cannot bend nor touch its own shoulder with it.  
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hurry and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to him. 
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess occurs to him, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back. 
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations, and of more violent pain to them; and very often death comes down with it. 
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is from those which are possible to reduce, is that his hand be extended with two hands: and his arm be spread out, and the hands of the physician be above the elbow and below it, and he presses the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place. 
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or truly the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until he strikes with the base of his palm the elbow which is dislocated. 
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	But if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer strong, vehement extension; and it is that two attendants extend the arm: and two other attendants also hold it fast so that it is not moved during the extension.  
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then let the arm be revolved to every part after it is wrapped over his hand a doubled long cloth, or a wide bandage.  
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil: so that it be one of those things which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.  
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he presses the joint with a vehement thrust, until it returns. 
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it, in which there is astringency, and drying with white of egg; and let it be bound with a decent bandage. 
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the sick person: and dismiss him for several days.  
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be loosened. 
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the junction is secured in its place, then loosen the ligature from it and let it go. 
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the junction not well constricted, then repeat the plaster and the ligature and let it go for several days until it is constricted. 
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then loosen it. 
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if it happens to have heaviness after the reduction of the junction and the disposition is in motion: then administer moisture in a bath and delicate friction and compression until it becomes straight or place on the junction a plaster, that is, fattened lamb's caul. 
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then let it be ligated and leave it upon it day and night. 
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it and introduce it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore it sweats, then rub the junction with temperate friction. 
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat upon it lamb's caul juice once, and a second time, and a third time with the entry into the bath until it is softened. 
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place upon it cow dung, moist, heated with butter and bind it on top of it. 
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it is softened and returns to its own disposition. 
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of dislocation by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Albucasis often dislocates the hand that is, the junction which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy. 
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Contrary to the rest of the junctions.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However it is necessary that there be swiftness in the reduction of its dislocation within the hour in which it dislocated before an abscess occurs: or heat should occur in it. 
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in it is that you place Albucasis' hand infirm on a table and let the assistant extend his hand and let the doctor put his palm on top of the eminence of the junction and push it until it returns. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary that it be considered whether the palm has already receded to the belly of the hand; then let the infirm place the back of his hand on the table at extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be inwardly on the table, that is, let the inner part of his hand be placed on the table so that the hand of the doctor may fall upon the prominence of the joint. 
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	Therefore if it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster soothing the swelling and send him away, and do not touch it again. 
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if he does not tolerate it, and you are unable to effect a reduction of it after days have passed, nevertheless the joint remains according to its crookedness; and nothing harms the infirm except that his hand is softened and he cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves are cut or rubbed. 
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore there is no remedy in this except to cauterize it near its joint. 
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that does not effect anything.  
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not return, then put upon it a plaster which we have described. 
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be bound and sent away for five days; afterwards let it be loosened and sent away, and let the hand be exercised.  
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if its motion is deprived and something weighty happens to it; then soften it with warm water and frequent friction until it is softened. 
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the Treatment of Dislocations of the Fingers. 
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.  
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from it, to any part, or from it, to the back of the palm or its belly; then extend the finger and press the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns. 
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it toward the part to which it is dislocated and send it away for two days. 
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it and extend it until its straightness is equal in its own day. 
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	Therefore, when it is night, bind it according to the narration itself; and do not cease to loosen it during the day; and exercise it with motion; and bind it at night. 
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days until it is tightened. 
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with it if it dislocates towards the belly of the hand; and bind it to the part itself, and perform your first operation on it until it is healed. 
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with it when it dislocates to the other parts. 
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Dorsal Vertebra. 
Caput XXXI.	Chapter Thirty-One. 
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the dorsal vertebra or the vertebrae of the neck are completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure in it, because death hastens the infirm person. 
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of it is that the excretion of the infirm person comes forth without volition, and he cannot hold it; and very often some of his limbs are softened from it, or both legs of his, or both arms of his, or one of them; or one vertebra is removed from its place. 
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Very often it is removed, because very often the removal of them happens in four parts.  
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is therefore removed to the rear is called a Kyphosis. 
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it, however, is that you consider then if the kyphosis happens from childhood; then there is no cure in it, nor any healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But as for that which happens from a fall, or a blow, or similar things like them, the ancients have already said modes of treatment in lengthy speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which most does not return with profit. 
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I, however, have already shortened it from that which excuses a little from a great deal of it because of my intention's proximity to it; and by my exposition in which I exposed it and formed its instrument in a different way from the one in which they showed it and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore I say that in a hunchback which occurs from the front part, there is neither skill nor healing from it. 
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which happens on both sides also. 
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, except that which occurs in the back properly, with that which I relate: and it is, that the weak one be extended onto his face above a level platform near the wall; and let straw matting be spread underneath him so that his chest is not injured. 
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight piece of wood be placed fixed into a hole in the ground, at the extremity of the platform, around his head; and another piece of wood around his feet at the other extremity of the platform; and let an assistant hold the wood, and let it not be fixed into a hole. 
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let another assistant hold the other one.  
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then let a soft, strong bandage be wrapped over the head of the weak one, and under his armpits; and extend the end of the bandage to the wood which is by his head, and bind it there. 
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then let another bandage be tightened above his hips, and above his knees, and at his heels.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then bring together all the bandages and bind them to the other wood which is by his feet.  
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let each assistant extend the bandage to the wood, and let the two pieces of wood not be removed from their places in which they are fixed; however, let them not be fastened, as we have said.  
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor shall place his hands upon the spine with strength until it returns; or he shall place them upon a board. 
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he attaches his feet to the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three cubits. 
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And dig in the wall of which we said that it is near the weak one, a place into which the end of the board may enter. 
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the Spondilem. 
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician put his feet on the other extremity. 
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him tighten it well, until the Spondilem is constricted and returns to its place. 
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a lathe which is enclosed with your hand; and it is, that you fix at the ground by the head of the sick man on the last step two pieces of wood, whose length is one arm's length: and by his head on the last step two pieces of wood. 
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length which is between all wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place, in which the lathe runs; and let all the wood be fastened firmly in the ground so that it does not move at all. 
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert a round piece of wood; and it is a lathe in which the ligature revolves in two holes of two pieces of wood. 
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its extremity there is a hole, in which wood is fastened, whose length is one palm with what revolves; and similarly in the two other pieces of wood.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligatures which you have tied in the chest of the sick man with the lathe which is by his head; and the ligatures which you have tied in his legs with the lathe which is by his feet. 
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let a servant stand by each lathe who twists his hand with licorice with which the lathe revolves; and the physician adjusts the Spondilem according to what we have said. 
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the lathe, which follows.  
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the Spondilem returns and the place is equal, it is necessary that you put a drying plaster with egg white.  
Deinde stuppam.	Then a cotton swab. 
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards place on the plaster a splint from a board, whose width is three fingers or thereabouts.  
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is such a quantity that it takes hold of the place of the Gibbosity and above the part of the Spondilem which is sound. 
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is tied with the ligature which we have said. 
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the weak one use delicate nourishment until he is healed. 
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	But if some eminence should remain in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines be administered which soften and soothe, with the application of a plaster as we have described for a long time. 
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a plate of lead is applied to that area. 
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes an eminence occurs in the last vertebra of the back: and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that is the bone which already protrudes.  
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not necessary to presume this with this medicine: for it may perchance cause death. 
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the treatment of a dislocated jaw. 
Caput XXXII.	Chapter Thirty-Two. 
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that dislocations of the jaw and shoulder do not occur unless it is a dislocation only: nor does what happens to other joints from slight removal and concavity happen to them.  
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the joint of the jaw dislocates according to four parts. 
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is because it dislocates forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it most often dislocates inward: and rarely dislocates forward and backward. 
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation inward is: because when you join the leg of a healthy person with the unhealthy one it is longer: and the knee of the unhealthy one is more prominent than that of the healthy one, and he cannot bend his foot at the groin: and there is a place following the groin inflamed with a warm poultice, because the head of the femur has already arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him to whom a dislocation outward occurs is that these are accidents contrary to those accidents.  
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him to whom a dislocation forward occurs is because he extends the healthy leg according to complement: however he cannot bend it without pain which is in the knee: and if he attempts to walk, he cannot go beyond that forward: and his urine is retained, and his groin becomes inflamed, and when walking there is pressure on his heel. 
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of one to whom dislocation has occurred backwards is that his knee does not extend, nor can he bend it forward before bending his groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and his groin is softened, and the head of his femur is at the place of the ilium. 
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this kind of dislocation is, however, that you consider then if the dislocation is old, which has already grown old with him having it. 
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction and it remains according to its own disposition, then there is no cure at all in it. 
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it must not be entirely presumed upon him. 
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in him whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four species of dislocation, then hasten to this so that you wish for the juncture, and extend it to the insides and outsides, and move it right and left: perhaps it will return, and not need any other cure. 
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong attendant, and he extends his leg from the lower part: either with his hands or with a ligament which is tied above his leg above the knee: and another attendant extends his hand from above so that he inserts his hands under his malleoli. 
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then let him tie with a soft ligament above the root of the femur, and hold the end of the other ligament. 
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let its extension be either from the front part of the groin to the fork part, or from the back to the dorsal part. 
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of them all be together, until the weak man is raised with his body from the earth, and remains hanging. 
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common kind of the four kinds.  
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we said it is good; and if not then it is necessary for every kind that which I shall say about its own proper cure. 
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reducing it when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary for the weak side to be laid upon its own sound side. 
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then let him place a bandage over the root of the thigh, on that which is between the head of the thigh and the place which is under the groin. 
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upward from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the collar bone. 
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another attendant take hold of his strong arms and reduce the thick place of the weak thigh, and extend it outward with a vehement extension. 
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now it will return to its place. 
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier than the other kinds of treatments by which this limb is reduced. 
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it is excused over you and does not obey you to enter with this kind of treatment altogether, then it is necessary for the two feet of the weak one to be bound together with a strong, soft bandage, over the two heels and over the two knees: and let the length of each be of the quantity of four fingers from its companion, and let the weak leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers. 
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the weak one be suspended over the head of a beam which is in the house, and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arm spans. 
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong young man to brace the head of the thigh and let another young man be suspended with the weak one: and let the other young man urge it forward bracing the thigh with strength, for the joint will return to its place with speed.  
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in reducing it when the dislocation is outward, it is necessary for the weak one to lie upon a bench, according as we have narrated in treating a hunchback. 
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let a bandage be tied over its leg, properly the weak one, and over its chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at its feet and the other at its head. 
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a piece of wood is placed in the middle of the footstool, fixed well; upon which wet cloths are wrapped so as not to injure the sick man; and let the wood be between his thighs so that he is not drawn downwards during extension. 
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let every attendant extend to his own part, and the doctor equalize the reduction with his hand. 
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it yields to reversion, it will be good. 
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place the board upon it and press it equally as we said in the humpbacked condition. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick man lies on his sound side.  
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is forward, then it is necessary that the leg of the sick man be extended quickly; and this according to the same account is upon the footstool: and let the doctor place the palm of his right hand upon the groin of the sick man. 
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he shall constrict him with his other hand, and with that constriction place him extended downwards towards the knee. 
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is backward: then it is not necessary that the sick man be extended downwards, and he shall be raised up above the ground; rather he ought to be placed upon something hard as it ought to be done also when his elbow is dislocated outwards according to what we said about his reclining upon two elbows; and it is upon his face, and the ligaments are extended according to what we said recently.  
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also upon the place to which the joint goes forth, when reduction is completed as it ought to be.  
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you; and it is that you extend the two legs of the sick man; and when you see them equal, and the sick man draws up his leg, and extends it without excuse: then you shall know that the limb has now returned as it ought to be; then join the two thighs together, and apply a plaster, and bind with an imemati, that is, a bandage, so that the elbow does not move towards any part; and let the sick man remain quiet for three days or four. 
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligature and bandage, and compare the leg with the other. Then if you see them equal in condition, then you will know that the dislocation is now firm; therefore dismiss the weak one to walking. 
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see anything of softening: then return, and bandage that, and bind it according to your first binding; and dismiss it also for three days. 
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it delay in walking on both for several days, until it is well strengthened. 
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Concerning the dislocation of the knee. 
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter Thirty-Three. 
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated according to three modes. 
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, that is, backward.  
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forward. 
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the weak one to apply his leg to his hip.  
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere with the hip, then you will know that the knee is dislocated.  
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is that you make the weak one sit straight so that now he extends his leg if he can upon it and adheres your back to his face; and place his foot between your feet. 
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his knee adhere with your palms, and place them straight between your fingers above his knee.  
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with force. 
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of restoration is that the leg adheres with the hip easily, not laboriously. 
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bandage it and make the leg adhere with the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind it together with a splint for three days or four.  
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them. 
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let him not walk for several days until he is healed. 
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if he refuses reduction to you, then administer strong extension with ligaments, of which mention was made previously in the treatment of a sprain, until it returns. 
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the heel.  
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV. 
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel is sometimes removed with slight displacement and sometimes dislocated according to its complement.  
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward. 
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding to the side to which it is dislocated. 
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	But the treatment of its removal is easy reduction, and it is that it be extended with ease with the hands, and equalized until it returns.  
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	But in the treatment of it when it is dislocated according to its complement, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit straight, and let a strong attendant hold him firmly from behind on the middle part of his back. 
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then take hold with your right hand of his foot from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot near the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand. 
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then push with your left hand twice.  
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with your left and push the chest of the foot with your right toward the leg without effort. 
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice as we have described. 
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the chest of the foot toward the leg in the third time, and you draw the ankle.  
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one or two times according to this method, and you see the foot equalized, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation upon him for it will return. 
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if reduction is prevented from you with what we have described, then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a wedge firmly in the earth so that it falls between his thighs; and you now have wrapped a cloth over him so as not to injure the sick person.  
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take hold of his thigh; afterwards, let another assistant extend the foot, either with his hands or with a bandage that he ties around the neck of the foot. 
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every assistant extend himself against the extension of his companion; and let a bolster stand between the two thighs of the sick man, holding him so that his body is not drawn downwards during the extension. 
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the physician equalize the dislocation with his hands, and let another assistant hold the sound leg downwards. 
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed. 
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	Therefore when the dislocation returns and its restoration is made clear to you: then apply a plaster and wad, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg. 
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or are afraid of the nerves which are above the heel behind, so that the bandage is not tight upon them and injures them. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then dismiss him for two days or three. 
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	And if the bandage becomes loosened, tighten it; then untie it on the third or fourth day; and forbid the sick man from walking for forty days. 
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if he should attempt to walk before that time, there is no safety lest the dislocation occur upon him again and be corrupted, and it will not receive a cure afterwards. 
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	But if a hot abscess should happen to him: then it is necessary that you administer to him in its sedation what our previous narration has stated elsewhere for treatment, and an application, until it is removed. 
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning the dislocation of the toes, and their cure. 
Caput XXXV.	Chapter Thirty-Five. 
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated from them be equalized with a little extension without labor; and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy. 
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in some of the knots on the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the sick man makes his foot sit upon a place equal to the earth, or upon a board; and he stands as though walking. 
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and put your foot on that which protrudes from those joints. 
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with strength, until it returns, and you see it now level, and no prominence appears in its place. 
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the belly of his foot a plank which takes the whole foot, which has two heads. 
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a decent binding for three days. 
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then unbind it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured from displacement. 
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Concerning the kinds of dislocations with wound or fracture.  
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six. 
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of that kind happens, and you attempt its cure and restoration, very often death follows; and therefore it is not necessary that one presume upon the cure of such a thing unless he is prudent in the art from long practice, merciful, pious, slow, neither bold nor presumptuous; and that he use in the beginning medicines which allay only hot abscesses: and let him send the sick man to divine judgment.  
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for salvation from destruction with the mildness of the illness, and in which something of hope appears. 
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning, before a hot abscess occurs.  
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	And if therefore the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen which allays the abscess; and care for the wound with that which suits it from drying ointments. 
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	But if the dislocation is with a fracture and separate chips occur in the bone, then attempt their removal and do in it what we said in simple illnesses from that which preceded in their places. 
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your strength, and guard yourself from entering the way of fear; according to my previous preaching to you.  
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more saving for your body among them in your time.
