Chapter eleven on the reduction of a fracture of the humerus
The upper arm is what is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder.
If it breaks, then set it in one of two ways.
One of them is that you take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness in this way:
And you tie two bandages at its ends, then hang it from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the wood until his armpit is attached to the middle of the curve of the wood, then a heavy object is hung from above it or an assistant stretches it downwards, then the physician adjusts the fracture with both his hands until the fracture returns to what it should be.
The other way is for the patient to lie on his back and his hand is hung from his neck with a bandage, then you order two assistants, one of them to hold what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other to hold what is below it and each of them stretches it to his side.
And if you want the stretching to be stronger, tighten below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the assistants stretches them to their side.
If the fracture is close to the end of the shoulder, then the [middle] of the bandage should be under the armpit, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then the bandage should be placed on that place and on the elbow itself.
Then adjust the fracture gently without violence until the fracture is aligned as it should be and heals well, then tighten it if no hot swelling appears, but if a hot swelling appears, leave it tightened until the seventh day, and put on it clarified wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the swelling subsides, then tighten it.
The method of tightening it is to apply the dressing to the fracture, then apply a roll of new cloth over the dressing, then gather the forearm onto the upper arm itself and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And apply the cloth and the tightening on the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as splints, if nothing prevents you from doing so and nothing has changed on the broken bone.
If you fear that something might change on you from that, then use splints, which is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let the width of a finger be between each splint, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an increase of three fingers from each side, then tighten on the splints the tightening that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, which is that your tightening on the site of the fracture should be stronger, and the further away the fracture is, the less the tightening should be.
If you see fit to place the splints and the tightening as we said while you are setting the limb from your hour, then do so.
And if you fear the hot swelling, then leave the tightening and the splints until the seventh day, as we said, then check the bandage every three days so that no itching or swelling occurs in the place, or that food is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, so fix all of that as we mentioned.
If you are confident that nothing of that will happen, then do not loosen the bandage except after many days.
And the patient should lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a moderate elbow pad filled with wool is placed under the upper arm.
And check at all times, night or day, so that the shape of the broken limb does not become distorted or the bandage loosens, so fix all of that with your effort.
And make the patient's food of the order that we presented, that the food be light at first until the bone starts to strengthen, then you should thicken his food.
It is customary for the upper arm and leg to strengthen in forty days, so then it should be loosened and the bath should be used and treated with ointments that are suitable for that.
If the fracture is severe and crushed, do not loosen the bandage from it until fifty days or two months.
