Chapter sixty-six on flatulence.
This airy adra, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron.
And the ancients mentioned that it should be made as we described in the adra that is with dalia.
And that is to tie the vessels gently below after the incision on it, then incise in the middle.
And treat the swelling with what opens it until the vessels fall off.
And treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
