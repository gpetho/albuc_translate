of the leech in the throat	On the removal of a leech sticking in the throat.	0.44611597
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I have said in the section, by the application of medicines; and when this is not effective, then look in the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed down their tongue with the instrument I told you about.	When you treat a leech by the medical means spoken of in the appropriate section, with no effect, then inspect the patient's throat in full sunlight after depressing the tongue with the instrument I have described.	0.7702908
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps that are suitable for this.	If your gaze falls upon the leech, pull it out at once with a small hook or a fine pair of forceps.	0.68261045
And if this is not effective, then take a horsehair rope and put it in the patient's throat, then place a hot iron on the end of the rope, and do this often. And have the patient abstain from water all day.	But if you cannot get hold of it, take a cannula and introduce it into the patient's mouth near the leech, then pass through the cannula a red-hot iron; do this repeatedly; while the patient must not drink at all that day.	0.74496686
Then take a glass full of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with your hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it will fall off.	Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, open his mouth in it and rinse out with it, but let him not swallow a drop of it; and he should keep the movement of the water going by hand time after time; for the leech straightway falls off when it feels the water.	0.85126644
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the patient with asafoetida, with the instrument that I mentioned in the fumigation of the uvula; do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.	If it does not come away by these means, fumigate the patient's throat with urine or with the juice of asafoetida, using the instrument described for fumigating the uvula. Do this several times, for then it will fall away.	0.7502076
And the form of the instrument with which one extracts the leech, is, when one can see it, similar to curved tongs designed to enter the throat; and it should resemble the beak of a heron, and have a roughened surface from a file, so that what it grips, it cannot let go; and here is the form:	This is the figure of an instrument for extracting the leech from the throat when visible. It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has this bend for entry into the throat; and the two extremities are shaped like a bird's bill, with the roughness of a file. When they have hold of a thing they do not let go.	0.78471357
