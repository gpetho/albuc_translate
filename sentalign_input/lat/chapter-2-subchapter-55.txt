On the treatment of infants who are born with unperforated urinary passages.
Chapter 55.
When one of the infants is born from his motherâ€™s womb, and the head of his penis is unperforated, or the opening is narrow, or in an improper place.
It is necessary to assist by making an opening immediately after birth with a very fine spatula, in this form.
Then place a slender lead nail in the opening and tie it in place, and leave it for three or four days.
Then, when he wishes to urinate, remove it, and let him urinate.
Then reinsert it.
And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the area will not allow it to close.
The one whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we have described, for many days, until it widens.
Those in whom the opening is in an improper place are harmed.
This is because, in some of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis head, so he cannot urinate forward until he lifts the penis upward by hand.
Nor can he procreate, because semen cannot reach the womb in a straight manner, and it is a very serious defect.
The procedure for this is to lay the patient on his back.
Then stretch the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and cut the head of the penis at the location of the glans, with a sharp point or a fine spatula: like cutting a reed, or as though you are scraping something, so that the middle forms like the head of the penis, and the hole falls properly in the middle.
And take care during your procedure to avoid the flow of blood.
For this often happens.
So counter it with whatever stops bleeding, and treat the wound until it heals.
