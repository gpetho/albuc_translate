قال واضع هذا الكتاب لمّا أكملت لكم يا بنىّ هذا الكتاب الذى هو جزء العلم في الطب بكماله وبلغت الغاية فيه من وضوحه وبيانه رأيت أن أكمله لكم بهذه المقالة التى هى جزء العمل باليد.
لأنّ العمل باليد محسن في بلادنا وفي زماننا معدوم البتة حتى كاد أن يدرس علمه وينقطع أثره. وإنّما بقى منه رسوم يسيرة في كتب الأوائل قد صحّفته الأيدي وواقعه الخطأ والتشويش حتى استغلقت معانيه وبعدها فائدة.
فرأيت أن أحييه وأؤلف فيه هذه المقالة على طريق الشرح والبيان والاختصار وأن آتى بصور حدائد الكى وسائر آلات العمل إذ هو من زيادة البيان ومن كيد ما يحتاج إليه.
والسبب الذي لا يوجد صانع محسن بيده في زماننا هذا لأنه صناعة الطب طيبة وينبغي لصاحبه أن يرتاض قبل ذلك في علم التشريح الذي وصفه جالينوس. حتّى يقف على منافع الأعضاء وهيآتها ومزاجاتها واتّصالها وانفصالها ومعرفة العظام والأعصاب والعضلات وعددها ومخارجها والعروق ينبض والسواكن ومواضع مخرجاتها.
ولذلك قال ابقرات إنّ الأطبّاء بالاسم كثير وبالفعل قليل ولا سيّما في صناعة اليد، وقد ذكرنا نحن من ذلك طرفا في المدخل من هذا الكتاب.
Because one who is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned concerning anatomy may still fall into error that could kill people, as I have often witnessed with those who conceived in this science and claimed expertise without knowledge or understanding.
And I have seen a physician, ignorant of anatomy, who incised an abscess in a woman's neck and severed some of the jugular veins, causing her to bleed to death before him.
And I have seen another physician who, in extracting a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the kidney, and the stone was large, acted rashly and extracted it with a piece of bladder tissue. And the man died within about three days, and I had been summoned to extract it; I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient what I had anticipated.
And I have seen another physician who earned his living as a quack among some of the governors in our city.
And I have seen a child of mine who had a fracture in his leg near the ankle, along with a wound. The physician, acting out of ignorance, tightened the bandages and splints around the fracture and wound very tightly, leaving no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he released him to his desires, left him for days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage until his leg and foot swelled, almost leading to his death.
And I was summoned to him, so I hastened to release the bandage, and he found relief and was able to move from his pain. However, the corruption had become severe in the limb, and I could not reverse it.
腐败继续在组织中蔓延直至其死亡。
And I saw a physician delay in incising a malignant tumor until its condition worsened, the fate of his companion becoming severe. This is because if the cancer is pure black bile, it should never be treated with iron at all.
Except in a case where the entire organ can be removed.
And for this reason, my son, you must know that work by hand is divided into two parts: work that is accompanied by safety, and work that is often accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned of every place in this book where the work involves risk and fear, so you must beware of it and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticize and attack, be firm and cautious with yourselves and gentle but steadfast in treating your patients.
And use the best path leading to safety and the noble outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult diseases.
And keep yourselves pure from what you fear may cast doubt upon your faith and in this world. It will be more lasting for your glory and higher in this world and the hereafter according to your station.
For Galen has said in some of his instructions: "Do not treat a bad disease and become a bad physician.
And this article has been divided into three parts.
The First Chapter.
In branding with fire and branding with sharp medicine, it is arranged from head to foot, and the instruments of branding, iron tools for branding, and all that is needed for handwork.
The Second Chapter.
In incision and reduction, extraction of foreign bodies and arrows, cupping and surgery, it is arranged from head to foot, and the instruments are illustrated.
The Third Chapter.
In resettings and divorces, and the treatment of dislocations, it is arranged from head to foot, and the instruments are illustrated.
The First Chapter.
In branding.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary to discuss its benefits and drawbacks, and in which conditions it should be used.
I say that the discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of branding is a long one, requiring a precise science and a hidden secret. Many wise men have spoken about it.
And they differed in their opinions. I have summarized only a little of their discussion to avoid making it too lengthy.
I say that branding is beneficial in general for all bad humors, whether present with a substance or without a substance, except for two humors: the hot humor without a substance and the dry humor without a substance.
If the dry temperament with matter differs, some have said that colocynth is beneficial in it and others contrary to that say that colocynth does not suit a disease arising from heat and dryness because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to cure a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry remedy, and those who say contrary to that have said that colocynth by the fire may be beneficial for a hot and dry disease that occurs in human bodies. Because if you add the humidity of the human body to the temperament of fire, you will make the human body cold.
And I say as he says because experience has shown me this many times, but it should not be imagined without great familiarity and extensive training in the use of colocynth. And he stopped to consider the differences in temperaments of people and the conditions of diseases within themselves, as well as their causes, symptoms, and duration.
And as for the other temperaments, you have no fear from them, and particularly not from cold and humid diseases, which all physicians agree on, and there is no disagreement about the benefit of colocynth in such cases.
And know, my sons, that the colocynth by fire is preferable to colocynth by a burning drug. For fire is an elementary substance whose effect does not extend beyond the organ it burns, and it harms another connected organ only slightly.
And colocynth by a burning drug may extend its effect to organs beyond, and it might cause a disease in another organ that is difficult to cure. And though fire, due to its dignity and the excellence of its nature, does not do this except if it is excessive.
And this became clear to us through experience due to the length of service and attention to the craft and standing firm on the realities of the matter.
And for this reason, I have abstained from lengthy speech. Were it not that it would not be fitting for my book, I would have revealed to you secretly the nature of fire and its actions on bodies, and its cure for diseases with a philosophical and demonstrative discourse that would penetrate your understanding.
And know, O my sons, that they have differed on the time in which branding is suitable and they have made the best time the time of spring.
And I say that branding is suitable at all times, for the harm caused by time itself is absorbed by the benefit brought about by branding. And especially if the branding is for a strong, urgent pain that cannot tolerate delay, as it fears that greater harm may follow than the usual damage caused by time.
And let it not occur to your mind, O my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians might imagine—that branding which cures a certain illness will never return. You should not consider it harmful.
And both these matters are not considered so, because branding is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries up the humors which are the cause of pain.
Except that branding is preferred to medicine because of the speed of its success, the strength of its effect, and the intensity of its power.
It may return at times of the year according to the temperament of the patient and the strength and potency of his disease, and what is present in his body from the coming together of superfluities in him and his neglect in acquiring them from food and such causes.
Ought to be that the disease in which cupping is used is a mild one and in an organ with little superfluity and humidity. Like cupping for toothache and the like, it may not return that pain, and this is in the lesser degree.
And as for the general belief that cupping is the end of medicine, this is a correct saying not as they intend it, because they believe that there is no remedy that benefits with a drug or otherwise after the application of cupping. The matter is contrary to this.
And the meaning that cupping is the end of medicine is that whenever we use various remedies for a disease and they do not work, then when we apply cupping, it works. From here, we conclude that cupping is the end of medicine. Not according to the meaning that the general public and many physicians who are ignorant of medicine have adopted.
And I have mentioned earlier that cupping with gold is better than cupping with iron, and they said this because of the moderation of gold and its noble nature. They also said that it does not congeal at the site of the cupping, though this is not absolutely true.
Because I have tried this and found that it only does so in some parts of the body and not others. Cupping with gold is better and preferable to iron, as they said; though if you heat the iron poker in the fire until it reaches the desired temperature for the redness of the gold, you may not be able to determine when to remove it.
Because it quickly reaches the coldness and if you increase upon it in fever it dissolves in fire and becomes molten. Therefore, it causes the maker to be occupied. For this reason, cautery with iron has become quicker and closer to correctness for the work, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cautery into sections organized from the head to the feet, making it easier for the student to understand what is required of him, God willing.
The First Section.
Cauterization of the Head with One Cautery.
This cautery is beneficial for the excess of dampness and cold in the brain, which are the causes of headaches, frequent nasal discharges from the head to the sides of the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, toothache, and throat pain. In short, for any disease caused by coldness such as paralysis, epilepsy, and fainting, and similar ailments.
The procedure for this cautery is to order the patient first to vomit with a mild and purgative medicine three or four days, depending on the strength of the patient, their age, and their usual condition.
Then order him to shave his head with scissors. Place him in front of you on a stool, with his hands resting on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with a pen.
Then heat the oil lamp iron, which is its shape shown here.
An opened space in the bone equal to the size of a barleycorn or a peas kernel, raise your hand, otherwise replace it with the same tongs or another if it has cooled. Until you see from the bone what you were told. Then take a bit of salt, dissolve it in water, soak a cotton in it, put it on the place, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton soaked in oil and leave it there until the inflammation subsides. Then treat it with the quadruple ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they said that the wound is better and more beneficial the longer it remains open to drain pus.
And some mentioned that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the hot iron should be held until part of the thickness of the bone is burned. Then, remove what was burned from the bone, and proceed with treatment.
And others said that one should cauterize extensively until it affects the bone strongly, causing a piece of it to fall off like a carat or a small seed. They claimed that this releases vapors from that area and keeps the wound open for a long time.
Then treat until it heals. I do not see these two types of cauterization at all except in some people, and leaving it alone is better with safety. If it does heal, the head will expand when its natural connection is separated as we have seen in other organs.
And especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is preferable and better for me; use it if you choose to do so, God willing.
The Second Chapter.
In the Correction of the Head Also.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and continues to affect the patient, and if various treatments such as massage, fomentations, inhalations, enemas, and dressings have been used without any benefit, especially if the same cauterization that we described has been applied and no relief is obtained, then examine. If the head of the patient is strong by nature and not weak, and he finds extreme coldness, then apply another cauterization slightly above the previous one. Then apply a cauterization to each temple of his head until the thick skin is gone and the amount of bone that we described becomes visible. And apply a cauterization at the back of his head in the place known as the axe, but be gentle with your hand in this; do not reveal the bone, for the patient finds great pain from it unlike the pain from all other cauterizations of the head. I will describe this cauterization in its proper place.
And the cauterizing iron used for the horns of the head and its back should be softer than that used for the middle of the head. This is its shape.
The Third Chapter.
In the Correction of the Acute Hemicrania.
If a sharp pain occurs in the side of the head with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, cause the patient to vomit using remedies that cleanse the head, and apply all the treatment I mentioned in the divisions of diseases. If this is ineffective, cauterize it in two ways. Either cauterization with the sharp burning drug or with iron.
Either cauterization with the burning drug is as follows: Take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides. Then, use a broad forceps to make an incision at the site of pain in the cheek until there is a space under the skin large enough for the clove.
It is inserted under the skin until it disappears, then it is tightly tied with ligatures. It is left for about fifteen hours, then loosened and the garlic is removed. The wound is left open for two or three days, then treated further.
Apply it with a cotton pad soaked in oil until the area becomes suppurated. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, if Allah wills. If you prefer, you can use some of the burning drugs mentioned in the eighteenth article on burning drugs.
And cauterization with iron is as follows: Heat the tongs, which is shown in this image:
And it is called the nail tongs because its head resembles a nail, with some curvature and a small peg in the middle.
Then place it on the site of pain, hold your hand steady, and turn the iron tongs slightly. The depth at which you burn should be about half the thickness of the skin. Then lift your hand to prevent burning the vein below, which could cause bleeding. Afterwards, soak a cotton pad in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then apply the cotton with oil, then treat it with the ointment until it heals by the will of God.
And if you wish, iron the blister with the point of the sharp scissors taken from the iron, and take care to avoid cutting the vein in this non-chronic blister.
Fourth Chapter.
Iron the chronic blister.
If you treat the blister with the advanced treatment we have mentioned and with what we have mentioned in the sections of diseases, and the treatment does not succeed, and you see in the illness something that cannot be treated by the first branding with medicine or branding with fire. You must heat the scissor-like iron until it becomes red-hot, placing it on the spot of pain along a line about half an inch or so in length. You then withdraw your hand once and pull it firmly until you cut the vein and reach near the bone.
Except that you must be careful to avoid contacting the jaw bone, which moves during chewing; otherwise, you may burn the muscle or the nerve that controls it, causing spasms.
And be careful and vigilant about the bleeding from the vein you have cut; indeed, there is danger in cutting it. And especially for those who do not know what to do and have no tried experience; it is better to refrain from the work.
And the management of accidental bleeding from the vein will be mentioned in its proper place in the book, if God wills. If you see in the illness something that this branding cannot treat.
I have seen the diseased body capable of it placed in a cut in the middle of the head as we described and treated the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you prefer, use the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on straightening the artery with the tongs having two blades; for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.
The Fifth Chapter.
On the Cauterization of Ear Ailments.
If there is pain in the ear due to cold and it has been treated with laxatives and other treatment as described in the division of symptoms and the pain does not subside, heat the tongs called النقطة. Here is its image:
Then apply it around the entire ear as you circle it, or around both of them if the pain is in both. And apply the cautery a little distance from the base of the ear after marking the spot with ink. The cautery should be about ten points in each ear or close to that. Then treat the areas until it heals, God willing.
The Sixth Chapter.
On the Cauterization of Piles.
Piles that are treated with cautery are only of the type that occurs from phlegm, as described in the divisions of diseases.
And cautery should be avoided for the type that occurs from dryness and spasms of the nerve.
When you have treated this kind of abscess with poultices, fomentations, and incisions without success, it should be cauterized with three cauteries. One at the base of the ear and the second slightly below his cheekbone and the third at the meeting of the lips.
Make your cautery from the opposite side of the affected area, for relaxation only occurs in the healthy appearing side.
A diagram of the cautery should be a cauterization made opposite the top ear tip beneath the skull slightly, and another on the cheek, with its length being the same as the upper arm.
Lower your hand with the cautery until it burns to half the thickness of the skin. This is a diagram of the cautery, which is a type of septic instrument, though a bit gentler as you can see. It should have a slightly thickened edge, then treat the area as previously described until it heals, by the grace of God.
Seventh Chapter.
On the Cauterization of Chronic Hemorrhoids.
If the hemorrhoids have persisted and your treatment as described has been ineffective, and there is no fever in the affected area, cauterize it with four cauteries. On each side of his head, a cautery, and one in the middle of the head as previously mentioned, and one at the back of the head.
Recipe for the cauterization as described above, and it can also be seared with a hot iron at the mouth of the stomach, which would be more effective, then treated as previously mentioned.
第八章。
في قيَح النسيان.
Which is caused by phlegm, it should first be given decoctions of the large roots and pure brain-tonifying herbs.
Then, his head should be shaved completely, and a compress of dill, as written in the article on compresses, should be applied to the back of his neck. Apply it several times, as it is a form of cauterization.
And do it in the same sequence as I mentioned there; if he is cured thereby, well and good. Otherwise, apply three cauterizations to the back of his head, arranged from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
And make the interval between each cauterization one fingerbreadth. Then treat each cauterization with the remedies mentioned above. If you wish to increase the treatment and the patient can tolerate it, apply the middle cauterization.
If you wish to increase the treatment, apply it to the horns as well. Then treat him until he is cured. The cauterization should be oil-based and in the manner previously described.
第九章。
In the cauterization for the falaj and relaxing all parts of the body.
It should first be treated by purging the head with decoctions as mentioned. Then shave the patient's head. Next, cauterize the center of the head with one cauterization, and apply cauterizations to each crown of the head, and also to the back of the neck.
And for three vertebrae of the neck, if in a disease of relaxation of the body you need more than that and the patient is capable of it and the disease is strong and persistent, give him four cauterizations on his vertebras of the back. And apply the cauterization until it burns more of the skin and then raise your hand. Then treat it as mentioned earlier until it heals, if God wills it, and let the iron be oily.
The Tenth Chapter.
On the Cautionary Treatment of Epilepsy.
Only the epileptic who has epilepsy due to phlegm should be cauterized. It is best to cleanse his brain first with hot applications and with all the treatment we have mentioned in the division if the patient is large and capable of taking medicines.
If, however, he is a child who cannot take medicines, let hot applications and brain-cleansing compresses be used before that for many days, along with improving his diet.
Then shave his head, and apply the single cauterization in the middle of the head as described in the procedure, and another one at the back. And for each horn of his head, apply one cauterization. If the patient is strong and capable, give him the cauterizations mentioned in the chapter on relaxation of the body at the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back. Let the iron be oily as described earlier.
If the patient is a child, make the iron gentle as described.
The Twelfth Chapter.
In the Correction of the Malnkhulia.
If the cause of malnkhulia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, use the cauterizations we mentioned in the case ofفالج.
If the cause of malnkhulia is an excess倾向 towards black bile, and the patient's body is moist and corrupt, use what has been mentioned earlier on in the classification for cleansing his brain.
Then shave the patient's head. Then make a tight circular patch of cloth. Place it in the center of his head while the patient is seated and supported, holding it from all sides. Then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it on the fire with a moderate heat, as much as an finger can tolerate when inserted. Empty it into the center of his head in the circle, and let it cool. Do this to the patient once a week along with all other good management until he is cured, if God wills it.
And if you wish, prick it with many small cauterizations without holding the iron. Instead, let it be a branding. For this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cloth soaked in tallow or chicken fat to it.
The Twelfth Chapter.
In the Correction of Water Running into the Eye by Cauterization.
If it becomes apparent to you at the beginning of water flowing into the eye according to the signs mentioned in the division, hasten to apply the procedure for easing the discomfort and cleanse his head from all moistures and bathe him in the bath before breakfast for several days.
Then shave his head and make a cut in the middle of the head. Make two cuts on the cheeks if the water began to flow in both eyes or from one side. If it began in one eye, make the cuts accordingly.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries under the skin, and let the cuts be long in width across the cheeks, preserving from bleeding.
If you see anything of it, cut it out on the spot with any treatment at your disposal. We will address the method in separating and cutting the veins and preserving from bleeding next.
And it may be necessary to make two strong cuts under the cheekbones with the cautery.
The Thirteenth Section.
On Curing Chronic Tears.
If the tears from the eye are chronic and constant, and they come from the veins and arteries in front of the head outside the skull, and you are certain that this is due to cold, thick, phlegm-related congestion, make the cut for cauterization as described for the beginning of water flowing into the eye. Cut in the middle of the head, make two cuts on the cheeks, and make two cuts under the cheekbones. If you need to increase it, make a cut at each side of the eye near the eyebrow with a small cautery.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In Correction of the Nasal Septum.
If the treatment as described in the division did not succeed, proceed with applying Cucumis colocynthis three days, then shave his head and perform the central cauterization with the oil-soaked iron. Then cauterize with the wooden iron two times above the eyebrows slightly below the hairline, taking care to protect the blood vessel and not cut it. This is the image of the wooden iron.
The Fifteenth Chapter.
In Cauterization for Relaxed Eyelid.
If the eyelid is relaxed due to a disease or moisture, cauterize it once with this semicircular iron.
And if you wish, cauterize above the eyebrows slightly, two times in each direction, keeping a distance from the cheeks. The length of each cauterization should be equal to the length of the eyebrow.
And do not过度热情地进行烙铁处理，只需让三分之一的皮肤被烧焦即可。烙铁的形状应如下所示。
The Sixteenth Chapter.
In Cauterization of the Eyelid.
If the eyelids turn inward, first evert the eye, and cauterize it in two types of manner. Either cauterize with fire or with a burning medicinal solution. If cauterizing with fire, you should instruct the patient to refrain from touching their eyelids if they are of those who pluck them, until they grow long and even.
If the wound is near a plant, tie his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until it grows. If it grows and becomes stable, place the patient's head on your lap and teach him on the eyelid with ink a mark in the shape of a leaf.
The mark should begin near the eyelid margin. Then place a cotton cloth soaked in egg white or dragon's saliva under the eyelid. Afterwards, protect and fix this shape with a mold.
Then mold it to the shape you taught it gradually many times until the surface of the skin, which is in the form of a leaf of aspen, burns completely. A sign that your work is correct is seeing the eyelid lift and the hair rise from the flesh around the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, then apply a cotton cloth soaked in oil until the scab falls off. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If any hair grows back after some time and the eyelid relaxes, treat it accordingly.
Then reapply the cauterization to that area as you did first. If the hair is on the lower eyelid, pluck it until it returns to its natural position without making the eye look asymmetrical. As for cauterization with a burning drug, you should order the patient to keep the eyelid open, allowing it to stretch and become even.
Then make a paper image of an aspen leaf. Take from the common soap and from the unextinguished lime, from each one, a weight of a dirham or about that. Crush them all well and do this quickly to prevent them from drying out. Then spread it on the paper you have made in the shape of a date leaf and place it over one or both eyelids. Place under the eye a cotton cloth soaked in egg white and hold the radula in your hand.
Then place your middle finger over the medicine and press it slightly, moving it whenever the radula feels the taste of the medicine because it finds in it a taste like fire. As long as it finds the taste, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the taste subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look, if you see the eyelid has lifted up as it does when tightened by heat or cutting, then reapply the medicine to the place where the medicine did not take effect and did not become black until you complete your work and tighten the eye. Then put on it cotton soaked in oil until the burning sensation subsides.
Then treat it with the date ointment or another, until it heals. It is essential when working that you be as careful as possible to ensure nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, for if the eyelid relaxes after days and we fear hair might have entered the eye.
Then reapply the medicine to that place where the eyelid has relaxed, specifically as you did at first. Then treat it until it heals. This is an image of a date leaf.
Know that people's eyes may differ in size and age, so adjust your technique accordingly. The correct path to success in this craft is not hidden from those who have experience with it.
Seventeenth Chapter.
In the correction of the hump in the cheek which appears in eye inflammation.
If you have treated the hump with what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases and the treatment was ineffective, it should be cauterized in this manner.
You should direct the patient to place his head on your lap and hold his head with a servant between your hands so that it does not move or strike with his head.
Then place a wet cloth on his eyelids, either in the white of an egg or in the saliva of a gecko. Then heat the iron, which is shown in this image.
It should be hollow, shaped like one end of an owl's feather tube, with the burning iron inserted at that end. If you prefer, it can have a开口的另一端。否则，可以做成静止的状态，如同纺锤一般。不过，这种一端开口的形式更适合你的需要，愿上帝愿意。
Then squeeze the hump if it is open and remove the mada (a kind of pus) from it, then dry it. If it is not open, you should make it open and extract its pus. Then place the heated iron on it, holding it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And withdraw your hand a little during the cauterization from the eye towards the nose to avoid误操作或使患者不安，导致铁器误入眼耳软骨，损坏它。如果在第一次烧灼时铁器已达到骨头，则无需再次放置铁器；否则，如需再次放置，请这样做。
Leave it for three days, then apply a cloth soaked in oil and treat it with the dried ointment until it heals. If it does not heal after forty days, apply the corrosive medicine until the bone becomes visible, and then proceed as will be described in its section,愿上帝愿意。
Another aspect of the shaping of the gourd, mentioned by some early authors, is to aim at the place of the gourd and incise it, then place a thin plug in the same incision. This is its appearance.
You should pour into it a quantity weighing a dirham of melted tin and hold your hand with the plug firmly and tightly sealed so that the diseased part does not move at all lest the melted tin flow into his eye. It is best to place on the eye of the diseased part a cloth soaked in egg white or water.
If the tin burns the place of the gourd and cures it wonderfully, then if the gourd is cured as mentioned by cauterization and treatment, there is no need for using a nasal puncture and returning the gourd to the nasal passage as will be discussed in its specific place.
Eighteenth Chapter.
In the cauterization of cleft lip.
Often a cleft occurs in the lip and is called a "hair" cleft, particularly in boys' lips, as it frequently happens. If this cleft is treated with the division method as mentioned and the treatment is ineffective, heat a small steel awl on this image.
Its interior should be heated until it becomes as soft as a steel awl. Then place it hot on the cleft, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with cerate until it heals, God willing.
Nineteenth Chapter.
In Repairing the Sharp Crack in the Mouth.
If a swelling appears in the root of the gums or in the cheek or in the roots of the teeth, then it becomes pus-filled and bursts, causing a sharp crack, and treatment is ineffective, it should be covered with a splint to fit the size of the crack.
Then introduce a hot iron into the hole of the crack and hold your hand until the iron is securely inserted to its depth, doing this one or two times, then treat it with the remedies we have mentioned until it heals, if Allah wills.
If the material is exhausted and it heals, then there is no need for further examination. Otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the rotten bone as will be described in its section, if Allah wills.
Chapter Twenty.
In Repairing the Teeth and Relaxed Gums.
If the gums become relaxed due to moisture and the teeth have moved, treat them with medications. If it does not improve, place the affected area in your hand, then heat the splint that will be described after placing the tube on the tooth.
And introduce the splint, which is heated with the firewheel, into it. Hold your hand for a moment so that the affected area feels the heat has reached the root of the tooth. Then remove your hand and reinsert the splint several times as desired. Finally, fill the affected area's mouth with salt water.
And hold it for a while, then discard it. The移动指令似乎出现了中断，我将继续翻译剩余的部分：
The Twenty-First Chapter.
In the Extraction of Pain in the Tooth.
If the toothache is due to cold or there is worm in it and medical treatment does not help, extraction can be done in two ways: either by extracting with oil or by extracting with fire.
As for the extraction with oil, you should take bull's oil, boil it in an iron pot or a ladle, then take a cotton ball and wrap it at the end of the rod. Dip it in the boiled oil and apply it to the affected tooth using the wheel, holding it until it cools down.
Then, repeat it several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. If you prefer, you can dip a cotton ball or a piece of wool in cold oil and apply it to the affected tooth, placing an iron tool heated on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
And as for extraction with fire, you should use a copper or iron tube with some thickness to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the patient's mouth. Then, heat an iron press (the tool used for this method), place it on the same tooth, and hold your hand until the iron press cools down. Repeat this several times.
For the pain will go either on that very day or another day. It is advisable after this extraction to fill the patient's mouth with good oil and hold it for a while, then spit it out. This is the image of the iron press.

The Twenty-Second Chapter.
In Kowt al-khanāzir.
If the pigs are due to phlegm and cold moisture and do not respond to maturation by medicines, and you desire quick maturation, heat the hollow iron fork, which is shown in this image with its two ends perforated.
Let the smoke arise from the other end when branding. Place it protected over the same swelling once or twice if needed until you reach the depth of the swelling. If the swelling is small, keep the iron fork at the size of the swelling.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton soaked in oil. When the burned area is gone, treat it with ointments and fomentations until it heals, if God wills.
The Twenty-Third Chapter.
In branding for hoarseness and narrowness of the windpipe.
If the moisture predominates in the windpipe, especially if there is also a cold temperament, it should first be induced to vomit with purgative medicines. Then brand it by branding in the notch of the neck at the base of the throat in the lower location.
Be careful not to reach the throat with the branding, and only burn a quarter of the skin. Then brand another time at the shoulder joint near the end of one of its large veins. The iron fork should be of the same shape as previously described.
Then treat it with what has been previously mentioned until it heals by the will of God.
The Fourth and Twenty-Fourth Chapter.
On the Cough and Disease of the Lung.
If the cough and disease of the lung are due to cold dampness and there is no fever or chills, and if the illness is chronic, apply two keiyas above the trachea in the low, soft, empty places and another keiya in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And the keiya should be in the form of a nail as previously described. If you prefer, it can be a puncturing keiya using the point-like keiya known as النقطة (nabqat al-naqd). Its shape was previously shown for puncturing pain in the ears, and the points should consist of about thirty needles.
Then treat it with what has been previously mentioned until it heals. You can make a keiya with three branches in this form and hasten the treatment, as you will be applying three keiyas in one session. This is the shape of the keiya.
The Twenty-Fifth Chapter.
On the Keiya of the Elbow.
If the head of the elbow dislocates due to slippery dampness, or if it does not remain stable after reducing it from its dislocation until it becomes habitual and then dislocates with the slightest movement as we have witnessed, it should first be reduced. Then, place the patient on their back or on the correct side. Raise the skin inside the elbow with your left hand fingers if the joint dislocated inward.
Then protect the two-pronged tongs, its image is shown here.
Then it is ironed with them until it is transferred to the other side, and the shape of the ironing will be four wrinkles. It may be ironed with a three-pronged tongs, making the shape of the ironing six wrinkles, and the prongs will be on the delicate part.
This is the image of the three-pronged tongs.
And an additional one may be added to this number, making the wrinkles eight. Then apply the curved stamped balls with salt, and bind the weak part well, so that the organ is not moved for a while until it strengthens. If the dislocation is upwards, this rarely happens.
Place one good round wrinkle or many wrinkles with punctures above the iliac crest. The joint will tighten, and the moisture will be eliminated, causing the weak part to heal.
The Sixth and Twenty-sixth.
On ironing the stomach.
If the stomach suffers from cold and excessive moisture, causing it to deviate from its normal state, and there is an increase in secretions, and various treatments have been applied but without success, it should be laid on its back with its legs and arms extended, and then ironed three times. Iron it with a round tongs under the handle of the chest, as wide as one finger. Iron it twice below each side of the single iron, so that the shape of the irons forms a triangle and keep the distance between them to prevent them from meeting if they become inflamed. The depth of the ironing should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the irons should be maintained.
On this picture and to this extent only.
And if you choose, make it with one large incision in the middle of the stomach as shown in this picture.
And the iron used to make this single incision should be circular as shown in this picture.
And the stomach may be punctured with points for those who are afraid of this incision. It is done by marking points on the part you desire with a pen, then ironing it with a point-making iron, and then treating it with the aforementioned treatment until he recovers.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
On the Incision of the Cold Liver.
If one complains of liver pain due to cold and dampness or from a fermentation gas until it has altered its natural temperament excessively, and the treatment for the affected part as mentioned in the division of treatments did not prove effective. It is necessary that the affected part be laid on its back and three incisions be made with a pen in this shape and to this extent on the liver below the ribs, where the human arm ends.
And after each incision, make another incision on the base of the thumb. The incisions should be straight along the length of the body. Do not hold the iron tightly with your hand.
Let the iron burn through to half the thickness of the skin no more. The affected part should be standing on its feet; if it cannot stand, let it lie with its legs stretched out and its arms raised. This is the shape of the iron.
And you may cauterize these vessels with the scalpel iron if you have a companion and skill in the craft and take care lest you delve into the cauterizing and burn all the skin, burning the belly and reaching the intestines; for the skin there is thin, so know it.
The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
On the Swelling of the Liver with Cauterization.
If a boil appears in the liver and you want to know whether this swelling is in the liver flesh or in the bile duct, then if it is in the liver flesh, he will find the lesion heavy and painful but not sharp.
And if it is in the bile duct, then along with the pain there will be a severe sharpness. I have found that this has baffled the physicians in its treatment; therefore, the lesion should be placed on its back, then learn about the warm area using ink.
Then heat the iron in the fire; this is the scalpel-like iron, and here is its shape. And cauterize it with one pass of the iron until it burns all the skin and ends the cauterization at the bile duct until the cord is completely removed, then treat it with boil remedies until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should be used only by one who has a long training in the craft of medicine and has frequently handled such cases through experience; then he may undertake such work, but leaving it to me would be better.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
In Treatment of Scrofula.
The ancients used the treatment of scrofula with the root of zraund. They took one long, dry root, longer than they could find, and made it like a thumb. Then they immersed it in oil and heated it over fire. Then apply one cautery between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries below the armpits slightly towards the area under the chin. Apply two large cauteries above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
And apply two more cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly towards the back. Apply one additional cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. Place three cauteries from behind, one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the sternum below the cautery between the hands.
And your hand should not delve deep with the cautery; it should only cause a burn on the surface of the skin. Some ancients mentioned that some people used an iron shoe-like clamp and would protect it to insert it between the ribs until it reached the affected lump.
The treatment duration is as we mentioned for a liver tumor. In this case, using the cautery on the boil can either result in the patient's death at that moment, or leave a fistula with no chance of healing.
The Thirtieth Chapter.
In Treatment of the Liver.
If your treatment of the liver as described in the divisional therapy does not见效，请您继续。
On the liver clips which present their shape, and there should be between each clip and clip a thickness of about the breadth of a finger or a little more, and the iron of the clamp shall have the form we mentioned for clipping the liver. Do not delve your hand deeply into the clipping, and the patient is laid on his back.
The other side is in the armpit and the skin above the liver is raised where the arm of the patient ends. The skin above the liver where the left arm ends is also raised. Your raising of the skin should be as wide as the body so that the clips fall along the length of the body.
Then you insert the tongs carefully protected so that they penetrate the skin from the other side. Then you remove the three-pronged clamp, making the clips four. If you wish to sear with the other clamp with four prongs.
Then treat the site of the clip after you leave it to drain pus for many days, for this is more effective than all that has been mentioned before in treatment.
The thirty-first chapter.
On clipping for hydrocele.
Clipping is effective only in hydrocele of the testicle, specifically. If you treat the patient with the various treatments mentioned in our classification and it does not improve, it should be clipped with four clips around the scrotum and one clip on the stomach.
And one clip on the liver and one on the spleen. Two clips behind his back between the vertebrae, one close to his chest and another close to his stomach. The depth of the clip should be about the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the clip open, allowing the pus to drain for a long time.
Do not neglect the diseased part in treatment after cauterization by what is appropriate for it, so that those who are meant to gather may hasten recovery. And the shape of the tongs used to cauterize the back shall be corkscrew-shaped as has been previously described, and the one used to cauterize the back shall be oil-filled.
The Thirty-Second Chapter.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in the edema and are filled with yellow water, it should be cauterized on the heel between the thumb and the forefinger.
And hold your hand with the tongs without bending it, then lift your hand and do not return it at all, for this will cause the yellow water to drain, and the tongs should be held in this shape.
Then cauterize the legs with two cauterizations on each leg. The cauterization should be made with the sharp end of the tongs along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another lower, near the middle of the leg. On each thigh, perform two cauterizations as well.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time until the yellow water drains from it, then treat it with whatever we have mentioned.
The Thirty-Third Chapter.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and moisture, weakening the grasping and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various remedies without success, and you find that the patient is capable of cauterization and has sufficient strength, then perform a large cauterization on his stomach. On what precedes in ironing the stomach with the circular iron and four irons around the navel, apply the gentle clasp iron and large iron on cotton over the omentum or two irons.
If you find the discharges abundant and the patient able to tolerate it, apply an iron on the scrotum and an iron on each thigh. Sometimes I added two small irons over the stomach near the large one; for it is a successful treatment whose benefit never fails by the will of Allah.
The Fourth and Thirty-Third Chapter.
On Ironing for Prolapsed Hemorrhoids.
If in the hemorrhoids there are chronic prolapsed hemorrhoids, many or one, and they are tough, cold, or bad discharges, and after treating them as mentioned in the division, the treatment was not effective, apply the gentle iron three times at the bottom of the spine below the waist slightly triangular.
Apply an iron below the navel about the size of two fingers. If you estimate that his stomach has cooled and his food does not digest, and I see his face swollen, apply a large iron on the stomach as previously mentioned, and one on his liver. And another on his spleen with a clasp iron. Leave the ironing open for some time, then treat him until he recovers, by the will of Allah.
The Fifty-Third Chapter.
On Ironing Thrombophlebitis.
After cutting it, if the cornu copiae is cut, heat the tongs resembling a claw, then insert them hot into the same cornu copiae that was cut and keep your hand there until the tongs reach the mouth of the vein from which the blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are many, cauterize each one separately as described, then treat them with ointments suitable for them until they heal. If his cautery is a large cauterization on cotton, it is more beneficial.
The Sixty-Third Chapter.
For the cauterization of the navel and its surroundings.
If the disease does not respond to the incision and the work we described in its place, and he becomes weak in that, it may heal by cauterization. If this happens to any navel and pus and foul moisture occur, the first thing you should do is measure it with a fine probe.
Then measure its depth with a fine probe. Heat the tongs resembling a claw, then insert them hot into the navel at the same depth as the probe entered and in the same straight line. Repeat the cauterization once or twice or three times according to your need until all those foul substances are burned.
And take care to avoid burning the nerve if there is one, or a large vein. If the navel opens into the bladder or the intestine.
And take care with all these places. You do this only if the navel is in a place that can heal and you have determined that it is not infected, then treat the area until it heals. If I cauterized the area and the discharges ceased and it remained so for some time, know that it has healed completely.
And if the materials do not cease from it, know that it is efficacious or there is a defect in a bone within its depth or something similar to what will be mentioned in its place.
The Thirty-Seventh Chapter.
On the Treatment of the Kidney.
If pain occurs in the kidney due to cold or a strong foul smell, and there is a decrease in seminal emission, it should be cauterized on the flanks over the same kidney, seared for each kidney with the clamp mentioned earlier. It might have been cauterized a third time on the same plate, resulting in three consecutive cauterizations, which would be more effective in benefiting the condition.
The Thirty-Eighth Chapter.
On the Treatment of the Bladder.
If the bladder shows weakness and relaxation due to cold and dampness, such that it cannot retain the seminal fluid, cauterize it with a burnisher at the bottom of the pubic region where the pubic hair begins. Also, cauterize another one on the right side and another on the left side of the pubic region.
It should be cauterized from each side to the extent of a thumb's knot. Cauterize it at the lower back with one burnisher, or two if necessary, and use the clamp type mentioned earlier.
The Thirty-Ninth Chapter.
On the Treatment of the Uterus.
If the uterus is affected by materials due to cold and dampness, it will become unable to conceive, and its texture will be impaired, making conception difficult. Alternatively, if pain occurs with its onset, it should be cauterized three times around the pubic region, as we mentioned in the treatment of the bladder.

Then we burn and the burning of the incision is of two kinds: either with burning medicines or with fire. The burning with fire has many aspects; one of them is to be burned exactly at the hip itself three triangular burns like this shape.
And it should be deep enough. The distance between each burn and the next should be about the width of a finger. The iron used for burning should be oily. Alternatively, one burn can be made in the middle at the top of the hip itself, making four burns in total. If you prefer, you can use the circle previously mentioned for removing the hip, which requires only one burn.
Let the circle encompass all of the hip and burn through the entire thickness of the skin. This is the characteristic of the burn in the sciatic nerve if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, burn two on the thigh at the position indicated by the patient's pain. One above the greater trochanter by four fingers towards the outer side slightly, and let the iron be of a knife-like shape. The depth of the burn should be only the thickness of the skin.
And if he indicates that the pain extends to about the fingers of the foot, burn where he points with an oily iron three or four or more times if needed. If he indicates the pain below the knee towards the leg, burn there one knife-like burn.
And be careful with all your burns not to reach a point where you burn a nerve or a large artery, as this will cause the patient severe or lasting harm.
And I have seen one and another who cauterized above the tibial tuberosity and was burned in the cauterization; so the leg suppurated until it reached the foot, and all of it suppured and all the leg became corrupt. Then diarrhea and death followed after that. If the pain was in both parts, he cauterized them both in exactly this manner.
And some of the scientists among the wise have described the cauterization of the hip as follows: One makes a ladle from iron with its diameter being half a span. It has a thick part at its mouth, like the core of a date fruit or a bit smaller. Inside this ladle, there is another ladle and a third one.
And the distance between each two ladles is about the width of a thumb. The ladles are open on both sides, and their height is about one or two thumbs. A holder made of iron is made for them to hold them securely. This is its shape.
Then it is heated over fire until it turns red and throws off sparks. It is then placed on the correct side of the hip, and the patient leans on the healthy side. He cauterizes him three circular cauterizations in one go. Then he leaves him for three days and binds it with oil. The wound is left open for some days.
Often, it is treated with ointment until it heals. The author of this book says that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its severity and the horror of its appearance. Only a few find it bearable. However, it is a good cauterization for those who can endure it and are affected by it in the right place.
And as for cauterization with burning medications, it is to make ladles similar to those used for pouring tin or iron.
There shall be in their resection about twenty degrees or thereabouts, and the space between them shall be the width of a finger's thickness. It should be open at the bottom and open at the top, and they should be held against each other in this manner.
Then place it on the right hip and let the patient lie on his sound side. Wet your hand well, then pour hot water between the two circles, which has been slightly heated by fire. Hold it for about an hour. The patient should endure its warmth and burning sensation; he will find it as fiery in taste.
Until the burning sensation subsides, then remove your hand with the instrument and wipe all over the hip with sweet water. Leave him for three days and apply oil on him until the blackness of the burn fades. Leave him for days until purulent discharge occurs; this is more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until he recovers. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold as you did for the hip according to its size. This is the formula for hot water, and I have established it in an article on the restoration of medicines.
Take one part of calcined salt and one part of unextinguished lime, grind them together, put them in a new pot with a small hole pierced at the bottom, proportioned to the amount that the decoction can enter. Place another thickened pot beneath the bottom of the first pot.
And pour sweet water over the salt and lime enough to cover them with an inch, after wetting them well with your hand. Leave the pot until the hot water settles in the thickened bottom pot. Then collect all that water, and pour it over fresh lime and new salt, repeating the process.
Then it will be very sharp, acting in many medical procedures and in the cauterization of all organs, for it does what fire itself does. Some medicines also serve to cauterize the hip, such as thafsiya, honey from palm date flowers, and a mixture of lime and soap that has been boiled.
Galen related a remedy for pain in the hip and women's diseases from ancient times, and he greatly praised its efficacy, claiming that it is not necessary to use any other treatment, and that it cures in one application.
It might even be carried to the bathhouse in a container and come out cured after one application. One should take green castor oil; if the green variety is not available, take the new dry extract, mix it with some fat, and apply it to the affected area of the hip, leg, or thigh where the pain is located.
And wrap it and leave it for three hours or until the patient feels the burning sensation subside. Then, take him to the bathhouse; if his body is refreshed, immerse him in a basin. The pain will go away and he will be cured by the grace of God. If he is not cured, reapply the compress after ten days once more.
He will be cured by the grace of God. Know that it is not advisable to use cauterization with these medicines unless the body has expelled its contents. Dioscorides mentioned that the juice of the goat if used to cauterize women's diseases can be beneficial.
The cauterization should be performed as follows: Take wool and soak it in old oil, then place it on the deep area between the thumb and the wrist, which is closer to the wrist. Next, take a dry goat's hoof extract.
He heats it with fire until it becomes a glowing coal, then places it on the cotton and leaves it until it extinguishes. Then take another, and do thus until the sense reaches the middle of the arm to the hip, and the pain subsides by God's leave. This kind of cauterization is called cauterization of the bura'.
The Forty-Second Chapter.
On Cauterization of Pain in the Back.
Pain in the back may occur due to many causes, such as a fall or a blow or excessive vomiting, and so on. It is caused by the accumulation of cold, wet material. Cauterization is applied only in this type.
Which is caused by the accumulation of cold material. It should be applied after vomiting with safflower or similar substances, cauterizing three rows on the area of the back where the pain is, each row as wide as a table. In each row, apply five cauterizations or more according to what you see in terms of the severity and strength of the patient's condition.
The cauterization should be done with a point iron. Alternatively, you can use three or four medium-sized nail irons on this pattern.
The Forty-Third Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Beginning of Hump Formation.
This condition often affects young children. Its onset in a child can be identified by observing difficulty in breathing during standing and movement. You may also find a protruding bead at the end of the vertebrae that stands out from the other beads.
If you see that and wish to stop it, apply with a tongs being circular in this shape. Take the cautery on every side of the vertebra equally. If you wish, apply it around the vertebra with a tongs having two or three points, let the points be close to one another. Then treat the area until it heals as we have mentioned.
And be careful not to use the cautery on the hump that occurs from nerve spasms.
The Fourth and Forty- fourth Chapter.
On the Cautery for Gout and Joint Pain.
If the joint pain is due to cold dampness affecting any part of the body, if the pain occurs in the legs, it is customary for physicians to call this gout specifically.
If the cold dampness causing gout does not respond to the treatments we have mentioned in the classification, and the pain persists, then cauterization can relieve it. This involves applying the cautery around the ankles after vomiting, using many cauterizations with a medium oil-based tongs as shown in this shape.
And if you need to prick the leg, do so with a point tongs. If the pain ascends to the knees or to other joints, and this often occurs, apply four or five cauterizations on each knee from every side using this same oil-based tongs.
If you need more cauterizations beyond this, apply them without deepening your application with the cautery; it should be about the thickness of the skin only. If the pain ascends to the hips or to the back, use what we have mentioned for cauterization in its section.
If the pain is only in the hands, puncture around the wrist as two circles. If the pain remains in the fingers, puncture each joint with a point and the hand comb. If the pain ascends after days to the elbows or armpits.
Puncture from every direction. No lesion is without good management and taking medicines. For if the food is well and the phlegm is expelled, it will be cured with this burning if God wills.
The Fifty-fourth Chapter.
In Puncturing the Foreskin.
If a fistula occurs in the rectum and some intestine or pus has descended to the scrotum, and this is a recent beginning, it should be ordered that the patient abstain from food for a day and use laxatives to help expel the feces from his bowels.
Then he should lie before you on his back and be ordered to hold himself until the pus or intestine protrudes, then push it back with your finger. Then mark with ink under the fistula on the sacrum a mark shaped like half a circle, its ends going upwards towards the body.
Then heat the iron to make its image.
Until a white substance throws out sparks, then push the intestine or pus back into his bowels. Then place a servant's hand on the area to prevent the intestine from protruding again. Having relieved between the legs of the patient and placed a pillow under him, put another servant on his feet.
And another on his chest, holding his hands, then the iron is placed on the mark itself and you stand straight with it and hold it until you reach the bone with it or redo it once if you did not reach it the first time to the bone.
And you preserve your effort to prevent the protrusion of the intestines while cauterizing lest you burn him, and thereby happens to the patient either death or a great disability. And know that your cauterization is not successful if you do not reach the bone with it. It is advisable that the iron for boys be gentle according to their size and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the place of cauterization with oil after three days until the blackness of the burn disappears, then treat it with other ointments until he recovers. Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is covered.
And you should make his food during his treatment such that it softens his belly lest the intestines protrude at defecation and urination. Then, when he wishes to get up after forty days, use a tight belt for forty days more, reducing his exertion, overfilling with food and drink, and loud shouting.
If he is treated this way, he will recover completely, God willing. I will mention the treatment for inguinal hernia by making an incision in its opening, God willing. As for the hernia that occurs elsewhere in the belly and is new, if you want it not to increase, treat it with a circular cauterization of its size. Let what you burn of the skin be like two-thirds of it, then treat it as we have mentioned. For it will not increase, God willing. Some early practitioners have also advised cauterizing the hernia with a triangular iron.
After learning the technique for hernia with ink and making the line at the upper side of the hernia and another line below, place your scalpel in the middle. The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
The Sixty-Fourth Chapter.
In cauterizing the throta.
If pain occurs in some organs due to a fall or blow and this pain persists for a long time and does not respond to medical treatment, it should be cauterized with a cautery point. The cautery should be applied according to the size and strength of each organ.
And if the pain and swelling subside from the first cautery, it is cured by the first cautery. Otherwise, reapply the cautery because it is common for such pains to spread to what is nearby. You should follow up with another cautery until the disease is cured.
The Forty-Seventh Chapter.
On Cauterizing Leprosy.
As for leprosy sufferers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type that results from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you intend to cauterize it, first observe whether the leprosy is new and treated it as described in the classification. If it did not subside or stop and you fear that the disease might corrupt all his humors, then cauterize him on the head with five cautery treatments. The one in the middle of the head, the common one and the second below it toward the forehead at the end of the hair and two on the corners and one behind at the prominence of the forehead and apply your hand gently with the hammer until it affects the bone slightly.
And the crusts peel off, making it easier for the vapors to pass through and for cauterization with the hammer in the same manner as the liver, as previously mentioned. If the leprosy has continued on the healthy part and a clear appearance has shown, then it should be cauterized with these hammer burns we have mentioned on the head. Cauterize the tip of the nose with one burn, two on the cheeks, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the lumbar vertebrae, one large one at the hyoid bone when the penis fails, and another above it on the same table. Two on the hips, one on each hip. Two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the elbows, two on the armpits, two on the wrists, and cauterize each joint of his fingers and toes with a burn. Also, cauterize each heel of his feet and brand his hands.
Protect the nerve at the back of the heels so as not to burn them. You may cauterize one burn on the pubic bone, another on the opening of the stomach, and another on the liver. Know that the more burns you apply, the better and more effective it will be.
Know that the healthy part does not feel pain from cauterization as much as the diseased part because its body is numbed. The size of the irons for cauterization should be appropriate to the organs and joints according to the previously mentioned qualities of the metals.
Then treat the scald with the powder of Cress and honey and all other treatment until he recovers by the will of Allah.
The Forty-First Chapter.
In scalds of the excoriated part, when a limb is scorched and treated with medicines and ointments but does not recover, then let the same limb be cauterized with scalding irons according to what the bone of the limb deserves or its smallness. Let the scalding be intense in the thickness of the skin somewhat.
Then treat it with ointment until it recovers. It may also be cauterized for some scalds that affect the hand and foot in the vertebrae of the spine at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, thereby removing the scald.
And none should do this except one who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
The Forty-First Chapter.
On scalds of the blister.
If the blister has become old and no medical remedy has been effective in it, then cauterize it with a deeper scalding iron according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with the powder of lentils mixed with the ointment of saffron, liver of leeches, or pigeon blood from each one part. Mix all together and apply it on a cloth and apply it to the area until it recovers.
The Fifty-First Chapter.
In regard to the cancer.
If the cancer is in its beginning stage and you wish to stop it, cauterize around it with the circle iron as you turn it. Some wise men have mentioned that it should be cauterized severely at its center. But I do not see this as advisable because I expect it to ulcerate, and I have seen this happen several times.
The correct method is to cauterize around it with a circle iron as we said, or with many small cauterizations.
The Fifty-First Chapter.
In cauterizing the dubella.
If one of the dubella has become delayed in development, either due to its being more favorably positioned or because the patient is an old man with little blood, or due to time itself; and if you wish to hasten its development, cauterize around it with many small cautery marks to incise it.
Then leave it, for it will hasten its development. If you wish to delay it by cauterization, heat the iron, which is shown in this image.
And apply it in the center of the dubella until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be as shown below to facilitate the flow of pus. Then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
The Fifty-Second Chapter.
In cauterizing the aeratrix.
The aeratrix is a decay that seeks to consume the tissue, just as firewood is consumed by burning fire. If you see the aeratrix in a place where cauterization with fire is possible, heat several small and large nail tongs accordingly to the size of the area affected by the aeratrix.
Then treat it from every side until all the decay is completely eradicated and nothing remains, then leave it for three days and apply the powdered sulfur with oil to the charred areas until all the scab and all the decay fall off.
Then treat it with ointments that promote healing of the flesh. If after three days you see that the flesh is growing healthily with no decay, then proceed as necessary. Otherwise, retreat the charred areas with heat on what remains diseased. The patient should be treated with a strong remedy.
For it serves in place of fire more effectively. I have mentioned its treatment with a strong remedy in the classification; take it from there when you need it.
The Fifth and Fifty-Third Chapter.
On the retreating of hammered and unhammered nails.
This condition often occurs in the soles of the feet and is a rough object that penetrates the foot. The treatment can be performed in two ways: either by retreating it with fire or by treating it with strong water.
As for retreating it with fire, you should heat a hollow tongs resembling the quill of an eagle, made of iron to fit around the nail from every side, and make its edges thin. Then place it hot on the nail and move your hand around the nail with the tongs until the heat reaches the depth of the nail.
Then leave it for three days until the pus forms. Afterwards, apply a poultice of crushed and salted wild breadfruit to the area overnight; it will fall off from its roots. Then treat the wound with an ointment that promotes healing of the flesh until it heals, if the nails are not hammered.
Often do we find them on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet. It is advisable to take a pipe of brass or iron or a feather of an eagle and place it over the nail or boil. Then one should pour a little of very hot water into the pipe.
Hold your hand and direct it with a slight twitch of your wrist to affect the edge of the pipe on the root of the nail. The very hot water finds its way deep into the root of the nail, and the patient should endure the刺痛一会儿。请注意，这里翻译时使用了“刺痛”来表示原文中的“ذ卢 الماء الحادّ”，这虽然是直译，但可能需要根据上下文调整以确保准确传达原文意图。如果需要更精确的医学术语，请告知我以便进一步修改。
Then leave it. The nail will fall out with its root. Do this one by one until all of them in the body are treated, then treat the places where they have fallen out with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Chapter Forty-Five.
In Treating the Nail.
If a nail is affected by cold in the nerve or by fever for a quarter or anything else, it should be cauterized four times or five times. Use the vertebrae as a needle between each cauterization, and apply one cauterization on its chest. And apply one cauterization on its stomach with an oil-stone iron. For the nail, this calms it and speeds up the resolution of the cold disease.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
In Treating the Boil That Occurs on the Body.
It may erupt in the body pustules ugly due to cold thick corrupt substances and it should be cauterized at the first appearance of each pustule gently with a stick that has been set alight at its end or with the stem of the long zarand or with a concave iron.
And the warts may be cauterized at the first eruption in this manner; it will not increase and the beneficial effect will disappear, and the patient will recover; but it should be done after the patient vomits by emesis.
The Sixth and Fifty-First Chapter.
To cauterize the bleeding that occurs upon cutting the artery.
Frequently, bleeding from an artery occurs that has been severed by a wound from the outside or when cutting a tumor or cauterizing an organ, and it is difficult to cut it.
If any of this happens, hasten with your hand to the mouth of the artery and place your middle finger on it and draw it tight so that the blood is constricted beneath your finger and nothing escapes from it. Then take from the fire several small and large oil-soaked pincers and blow on them until they become extremely hot.
Then take one, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery was severed. Place the pincers on the same vein after quickly removing your finger with the clamp and hold the pincers until the blood stops.
If the bleeding continues when you raise your finger from the mouth of the artery and extinguish the pincers, take another pair quickly from the hot pincers in the prepared fire. Continue doing this with one after another until the bleeding stops.
And take care not to burn a nerve, for if this occurs, you should treat the affected area with another ligature. Know that if a blood vessel bleeds from it, it cannot be cut, especially if the vessel is large, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization as we said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. And if it is amputated, its ends will contract and the bleeding will cease. Either it can be tied with threads tightly, or medicines that are capable of stopping the bleeding can be applied to it, and the vessels can be pulled tight.
And as for those who attempt to stop it by tying with a bandage or pulling the veins or applying burning substances and the like, it will not cease at all except in rare cases. If such a situation arises and there is no doctor or medicine available, he should immediately place the third finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
And pull it tightly until the bleeding stops and flows above the wound onto the vessel. The finger must remain cold with very cold water constantly to freeze the blood, thicken it, and stop it. During this time, observe whether cauterization or medicine is needed.
The Second Chapter.
On Incisions, Punctures, Incisions with Forceps, and Surgical Wounds and Similar Conditions.
Albucasis said: We have already mentioned in the first chapter all diseases that are suitable for cauterization with fire and burning medicines, and their causes and symptoms, as well as their instruments and the forms of applicators. We have made this into chapters from the thigh to the foot.
And I proceed in this matter exactly as described so that the student may easily obtain what is required.
Before I begin with this, you my sons, should know that in this chapter there is even more risk than in the first chapter concerning the cauterization.
And for this reason, the warning must be stronger, for the work in this chapter is great, and in it there often occurs the evacuation of blood from which life depends upon opening a vein or cutting into a tumor or bursting an abscess or surgical treatment or extracting an arrow or cutting into a stone, and similar things that accompany all of them risk and fear, and death occurs in most of them.
And I advise you to beware of what is doubtful to you, for in this craft various kinds of people with different afflictions may occur to you. Some may be weary of their illness and find death轻化。
And I advise you to beware of those who are severely afflicted by their sickness, suffer from the duration of their illness, and whose disease indicates death. Some may offer you their wealth in hopes of recovery, but their illness is fatal. It should not be among such people that you seek help; rather, you should avoid assisting them entirely.
And let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness. Do not proceed with anything from this except after certain knowledge that can be verified by you leading to the praised outcome. Use in all your treatments a preliminary understanding and warning about what safety may lead to.
And indeed, you have in this the means to earn praise and glory, and be remembered and commended. May Allah guide you, my sons, to the right path and grant you correctness and success; verily, that is in His hand; there is no god but He.
And I have arranged this chapter into sections according to what was presented in the chapter on cauterization from foot to hand so that the demand of what you desire from it may be easier for you by the will of God.
The First Section.
On the Treatment of Water That Collects in the Heads of Boys.
This illness is often encountered in boys at birth if the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness. It may also occur due to a hidden cause that is unknown.
I have not seen this condition in anyone other than boys. All those I saw among them died quickly, so I therefore decided to refrain from treating it. I have also seen a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day. Until the boy could not sit on his own head, which had become too large, and the fluid continued to increase until he died.
And this fluid may gather between the skin and the bone, or it may collect underneath the bone on the diploe. The treatment, if the fluid is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, should be to make a single incision in the middle of the head, with the length of the incision about two fingerbreadths, so that the fluid may drain. This is the shape of the instrument used.
If the fluid is greater and the swelling is larger, make two intersecting incisions as shown.
And if the fluid is underneath the bone, its sign is that you see the scalp incisions open on all sides, and when you press it with your hand, the water drains inward. This should not be hidden from you; therefore, you should make three incisions in the middle of the head as shown.
After the incision, all the moisture is removed, then the incisions are tightened with sutures and ligatures. It is then treated from above with drink and oil until the fifth day. The bandage is changed, and the wound is treated with thread and ointments. The head should be tightened适度调整以符合原文意思，不添加解释）。
Until the organ strengthens and heals, another recipe for incision is to look where the bone of the tumor protrudes and the water汇聚翻译更自然，保持原文意思。）
You should incise where the tumor is突出显示的位置，并确保不要切断血管，以免引起出血。伤口会因此死亡并排出水分。）
Chapter Two.
Cut the two vessels behind the ears, known as al-Hususan.
If a severe illness affects the eyes or the chest and medical treatment does not help, the next step in treatment is to cut these two vessels.
If you wish to cut these vessels, you should shave the head of the patient with scissors. Then, probe the area with a rough cloth to make the vessel appear. Next, tighten the neck of the patient with the help of his shirt. Then, look where the pulse beats and its position, which are the two depressed areas behind the ears, keeping in mind that some people may have more hidden ones.
Then, mark them with a pencil. Next, cut them with forceps to the bone, and this can be done by exposing the head. If you prefer, you can insert the forceps from under the vessel and cut it from above. The length of the cut should be about two closed fingers.
If the vein is cut off, the blood comes out in a pulsating manner, rushing forward and flowing continuously. If the artery does not appear by touch, it should be estimated from the ear after three fingerbreadths, then marked with ink and incised to the bone, and that which ought to be done.
You send six veins of blood on medium size; perhaps you will send more or less. All of this according to what you see concerning the strength and fullness of the vein. Then look at the wound; if there is anything of the periosteum remaining on the bone, cut it off.
Lest it become a hot swelling, then tighten the wound with a thread of torn linen cloth, and treat it with ointments until it heals.
The Third Chapter.
Tie the arteries in the cheeks.
If a person has a chronic sinusitis or acute fits due to hot humidity and heat in the cheek muscles or severe and persistent headache, and so forth, and treatment methods of medicine have not been effective, we have found that tying or cauterizing the arteries in the cheeks as described can be efficacious.
The procedure for tying the arteries involves shaving the hair from the cheeks. You should aim for the visible artery in the cheek; its pulsation will be evident to you, and very little of it is hidden except in an individual case.
Or when there is severe cold, if it is hidden from you, the patient should raise his neck with the help of a garment. Then you should press the area with a cloth or apply a hot poultice to the spot until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the forceps which is depicted in this figure. Then strip the skin gently with it until you reach the vein. Then insert a probe and draw it upward until you remove it from the skin, freeing it from the sinews beneath on all sides. If the vein is delicate, bend it with the tip of the probe. Then cut a portion of it according to the distance between its ends, and ensure that it constricts without causing bleeding. For if it is not amputated and does not cease, the blood will not stop flowing at all. Then evacuate six ounces to three ounces of blood.
If the vein is large, it should be tied in two places with a doubled strong thread. The thread should either be from linen or from tendon sinew to prevent corruption from reaching it before the wound heals and cause bleeding.
Then cut the remaining portion between the ties. You can do this at that time or after another interval. If you wish, cauterize it with a surgical iron until its ends are amputated. This will serve the same purpose as, or even better than, what we have described.
Except if the patient has a fever or has a disturbed temperament, for cauterization helps in eliminating moisture and is more effective in its benefit. After tying the veins, the area should be stuffed with old cotton and well-packed bandages placed on top. After removing the bandages, it should be treated with drying medicines that promote flesh growth, and by fomentation until Allah wills his recovery.
If bleeding occurs from the vein during your work, act quickly to cut it either by cauterization or by stuffing the area with moist material and tightening your hand until the blood stops. If you have nothing of that sort at hand, place your finger there to constrict the blood flow.
Anoint the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides and it is tightened to what is required, and what is lighter and easier than to ligate the vessel is to cauterize the vein with this two-edged iron poker after learning the places with ink.
And apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and stops the vein at two places so that what is between its ends separates, for it will not stick by this cauterization at all. This is the image of the poker.
It should be sharp like the two small scissor blades, but it should be much less sharp than a scissors blade, for if they were as sharp as scissors, the cold would reach them quickly and the flesh would not stop quickly. If there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire clings to them.
And the flesh cuts quickly, and this work is better than any other and lighter and easier. Let the thickness between the scissors be about the thickness of a finger.
Fourth Section.
On the Treatment of Continuous Flow of Hot Tears into the Eyes.
If the tears are continuous and flow from the veins on the forehead outside, and no treatment with medicines has benefited her, and I have seen the face of the patient turn red. And there is a thrumming in his forehead like the tapping of ants, and his eyes are red and wet, with the eyelids peeling due to the sharpness of the tears, forcing the initial treatment to this work, which they call treating with a sword. It involves ordering the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then make three parallel incisions in the forehead along its length. The length of the incision is about two fingers. Each incision is parallel to the length of the nose at the center of the forehead, the second slightly away from the muscle movement in the temple, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the vessels on either side. Keep your hand away from the connection of the jaws. The distance after each incision should be about three closed fingers. Have with you a prepared sponge slice or many dry porous slices to absorb the blood.
Then insert the sharp forceps whose shape is shown here. From the incision following the temple to the middle incision, strip off all the skin between these two incisions along with the fascia on the bone. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision. Then remove this forceps. And insert another instrument into the first incision, called a sharp scissor from one side and smooth but not sharp from the other. This is its shape:.
And make its sharp side towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision, cutting all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do the same in the middle incision to the other one. After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, squeeze the areas where the clotted blood is located. Then in each incision, apply a cotton wick and place it over a pad soaked in a mixture of water, oil, or vinegar and oil.
Lest a hot tumor occur and on the third day the bond dissolves, use much cold water for irrigation, then treat it with basilikons ointment mixed with rose oil and whatever is used to treat wounds until it heals, God willing.
The Fifth Chapter.
In the treatment of tears and colds affecting the eyes from behind the head.
When a severe, sharp, continuous cold occurs, and you see the eyes weakened by small, shriveled conditions with diminished vision, and the eyelids are injured, with the eyebrows falling out. There will be a severe, painful headache deep in the head, followed by continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that such materials and colds arise from deep, numerous blood vessels, and the best treatment for this is this remedy: order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make a single incision in the center of the forehead.
There will be a severe, painful headache deep in the head, followed by continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that such materials and colds arise from deep, numerous blood vessels, and the best treatment for this is this remedy: order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make a single incision in the center of the forehead. Or a bit wider and begin the incision from the left zygomatic bone to the right zygomatic bone. The incision should go through the bone, and keep your hand away from the movable muscles of the zygomatics near chewing until the bone is exposed and all the blood is suctioned out with the sponge.
分开裂口的两唇，用旧棉花或棉线，然后从上方牵引血管，并将血管浸湿饮料和油，以防发生热肿。等它愈合，你看到热肿已经破溃，应该开始刮骨，直到肉芽组织生长。
Then treat it with the dried management that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of calafornia and prepare thereof a cream and use in promoting flesh growth in such surgeries.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is of four kinds: either a metallic stone like iron and glass, or a plant seed like chickpeas and nuts, or a liquid thing like water and vinegar.
And if it is an animal, then whenever a stone or a kind of stone that does not exceed in the ear falls into the ear, receive it with the sun-facing ear. If you see the stone, diminish something in it with fat of saffron or myrtle, then try to remove it by moving the head or squeezing with a cloth. Plug the nostrils when a sneeze comes after placing a ring of cloth or wool around the ear and tilt the ear upwards. Often, this treatment will cause it to come out. If it does not come out, try removing it with a gentle cotton swab, which is depicted in this image.
If it comes out with the cotton swab, and if not, try removing it with a gentle curved forceps that has little curvature. If it does not come out with that, make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole with wool.
Plug the area around the tube with a moistened quill softened by fat to prevent any air from entering except through the tube. Then draw it out strongly with your breath. Often, this will cause it to come out. If it does not come out as described, take a small amount of Nabatean gum or prepared gum used for catching birds, and place it at the end of the swab.
After applying a tight cotton pad, then insert it gently into the ear hole after the ear has dried from moisture. If it does not come out with everything as described, proceed to incise before hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The recipe for incising is to open the abscess in the ear first and drain it of blood according to its strength, then situate the abscess before you and turn its top side upwards and make a small incision at the base of the ear where the fat is located in the lower part.
The incision should be crescent-shaped so that you reach the stone, then remove it as much as possible with your instruments.缝合伤口应迅速进行，并彻底处理直至痊愈。
And if the fallen object in the ear is one of the seeds that swell up, try to remove it as we have mentioned. If it does not yield to this method, take a fine and gentle forceps like this one.
And try to cut that type of fallen seed in the ear with it. Do this only if you are certain that the seed has adhered due to the moisture in the ear, turning it into many small pieces, then remove it with a blind forceps or a gentle probe or by suction.
As we have mentioned, it is easier to remove. If water has entered the ear, it should first be expelled by tickling the nose with a quill or similar object, while stuffing the ear with some old cotton and lying on the side with the ear containing the water facing down; if this removes it.
والّا فتأخذ حصيات كثيرة على طول الأصابع رقاقا ملسا فتدفّئها بالنار قليلا ويدخل العليل منها واحدة في ثقب أذنه ويحجل على رجله الواحدة من تلك الجهة ويضرب بحجر آخر على الحجر الذي في الأذن.
فلا يزال يفعل ذلك بحصاة حصاة حتّى يخرج جميع الماء، وقد يخرج الماء بأن يؤخذ من البردىّ او من الريش واحدة ويدخل طرفها الواحد في الأذن وتقد الطرف الآخر بالنار حتى يحترق أكثره ثمّ تعيد ريشة أخرى.
تفعل ذلك مرّات حتّى يخرج جميع الماء أو تجذبه بالأنبوبة على ما تقدّم في الحصاة، وأمّا إخراج الحيوان الداخل فيها فانظر فإن كان صغير الجثّة كالبرغوث ونحوه فالعاجله بما ذكرت في التقسيم وأمّا.
إن كانت جثّته كبيرة تظهر للحسّ فحاول إخراجه بالجفت والصنانير وأمره أسهل من جميع ما ينشب في الأذن، وأمّا إخراج الدود المتولّد في الأذن إذا عالجتها بما ذكرنا في التقسيم في مقالة القطورات ولم ينجع علاجك.
فينبغى أن تنظر الى الأذن في الشمس فإن ظهر اليك شيء من الدود فأخرجه بالجفت أو بالصنانير اللطاف فإن لم يظهر اليك منها شيء فخذ أنبوبة هذه صورتها.
ضيقة الأسفل واسعة الأعلى وأدخل الطرف الرقيق في الأذن على قدر ما يحتمله العليل ثمّ مصّ به مصّا قويّا تفعل ذلك مرّات حتّى يخرج جميع الدود فإن لم يجبك للخروج فسدّ حول الأنبوبة بالشمع كما ذكرت لك في الحصاة.
If it does not come out as we mentioned, use the caustics which I have mentioned and the early ones tried them in killing worms and you will find that in a treatise on caustics. And your pouring of ointments and medicines into the ear with this instrument and here is its image.
As you see, it is made of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. If you wish, the tube inside the cylinder can be made of紧密的铜丝缠绕在顶端。
Then you throw the ointment or juice or whatever you wish from these medicines into the tube, which is in the ear. Then you insert the wick with cotton at the top and squeeze it moderately with your hand until the ointment flows into the cavity of the ear and you feel it.
Let the remedy enter with it, and let what you pour into the ear be slightly warmed in the fire. Beware that the thing which drips therein is neither too cold nor too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the Treatment of Temporary堵塞的耳病。
Some infants may be born with their ears unperforated.
And it may also occur in some people that there is a blockage in the ear canal due to a wound or growth inside it. This blockage may be deep within the ear canal and not visible.
And it may occur slightly outside the ear canal and be visible. That which occurs deep in the ear and is not visible, is most often difficult to remove. And that which is visible should have the ear filled with sunlight. And examine it; if you see the obstruction evident, open it with a gentle forceps; this will be its appearance:
Its tip will have some slight width limited to part of it, while the rest of the forceps is smooth on both sides to avoid injuring the ear. If the obstruction is from flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a gentle clamp and cut it with great delicacy until all the flesh is extracted.
If the obstruction is deep in the ear, take a smooth, gentle probe and warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction along with the heaviness of hearing loss that the patient experiences, remove it gently.
And take care not to wound the auricular nerve. Then insert a wick into the ear canal, as large as the opening allows, which you have moistened with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are safe from the wound joining or take a wick, moisten it in water, and sprinkle it with powdered resin.
And use it; if you see the ear swollen with a hot inflammation, it should be removed and replaced with another wick moistened in cyrtoidium made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides. Then treat it until it heals.
And if there is a bleeding, wet a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear. Use the remaining treatment to stop the mentioned bleeding as described in the section on cataplasms.
The Eighth Chapter.
In the treatment of warts that occur on the eyelids.
These warts that occur on the eyelids may be wet and may become dry. It should be grasped with forceps or clippers and cut off from its roots. Then apply a paste of powder to the area.
If it bleeds, cauterize it with a gentle iridectomy probe and cauterize it better after cutting. Often it returns if there remains anything from its roots. If you cauterize it with fire, it burns those roots and does not return.
Chapter Nine.
In the treatment of colds affecting the eyelids.
Often something resembling a cold in its firmness occurs on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called a cold, which is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The treatment involves examining it; if the swelling is prominent on the surface of the lid and moves in all directions, then its cure is simple. In this case, make a lateral incision.
Then strip it off from every side gently until it is completely removed. Then clamp it with forceps and cut it out. If you are unable to cut it, do not cut the lid until the incision penetrates through the lid; this will not harm the patient at all. If the incision is large, suture it up and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, you do not need to worry about it, for a ointment will heal and constrict it. If the swelling leans towards the inner surface of the lid, turn the lid inside out, clamp the swelling with forceps without needing an incision, and cut it off from every side.
If the eyelid is excised, this will cause no harm. Then wash the eye after cutting the bridle with salty water and treat the area with a cauterizing agent until the disease is cured.
The Tenth Chapter.
In the treatment of trichiasis that occurs in the eyelid.
Trichiasis is a condition where eyelashes grow inwards towards the eye, affecting mostly boys, making their eyes feel heavy and causing them to be susceptible to nocturnal infections. They are unable to look at sunlight. In order that the tears speedily reach them.
And therefore, you will find them always resting on their faces and sleeping with their faces down. Their eyelids below the eyebrows are wet and show the puffiness of trichiasis. When you press the area with your fingers, you can feel the trichiasis between them. The treatment should be that the patient rests his head on your lap.
Then take a cloth of linen, make a wick from it, and create a circle with that wick as large as the area around the trichiasis on all sides. Place it over the trichiasis and press it with your fingers from all sides to gather the trichiasis in the center of the circle.
Then make a slit in the center of that wetness with the bistoury from side to side, and the slit should not be wider than the incision made in circumcision. As for the depth, you should cut through the skin entirely until you reach the trichiasis.
In most cases, the trichiasis protrudes from the slit in the form of a white fatty piece. Draw it out with a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers and move your hand to the right and left until it is completely removed. Be careful not to widen the slit too much to avoid the bistoury entering the eye and injuring it.
If the hernia does not appear to you at first incision, it should be necessary to widen the incision slightly gently until the hernia appears, then draw it as we said before. Then immerse a piece in vinegar and water and place it on the spot and tighten it with a bandage. Some people crush salt.
He should place it in the cavity of the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals. If there is a hot swelling at the spot, treat it with soothing dressings until it heals.
The Twelfth Chapter.
On Various Methods of Tightening the Eye.
If a fold of excess eyelid tissue grows above the natural course under the natural eyelids and becomes constricted, it will harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, drooping of the eyelids, whiteness, and hardness until this becomes a reason for the blindness of the eye.
Tightening the eyelid can be done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or by using a sharp medicine as described earlier in the section on cauterization, or by tightening through cutting and stitching, or by using splints, as I have mentioned.
You should place the patient's head on your lap. Then, turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, do nothing else. Otherwise, insert a needle with a thread underneath the lower eyelid and pass the needle with the thread from above, making sure to keep it near the hairline. Then, draw the thread upwards using the eyelid.
Then turn it with the forceps. Next, incise the inner side of the eyelid without cutting the excess hair with the dissecting forceps from above downward to below. Then draw the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid. Finally, suture the eyelid with catgut.
Like the shape of the date leaf, yet it should be such that the shape is in proportion to what you desire for lifting the eyelid, as there may be differences among people. Some may need a sufficient part of the eyelid cut according to how relaxed the eyelid is.
And some may need a lesser cut than all of that, according to the relaxation of the eyelid. Then incise with the forceps along the two lines you taught, starting from the outer margin to the inner margin. Each incision should be near the natural hair by the thickness of a wrinkle.
Then insert the forceps into one of the corners of the skin, peel it completely off, and sew the two lips together with an细针和细线。抹去血迹，将剩余的线缝在眉毛上用一些碎屑固定住。
If you choose to do so, and otherwise I care not, then the stitches and threads should be left in place for about three or four days. Then treat it accordingly. If you prefer to leave the wound unsewn, treat it with something that dries and constricts, as the eyelid will lift upon sealing the wound and bringing it together. Sewing is better.
This method of lifting the eyelid, as mentioned by the ancients, has a burden on the patient; yet it is good work and poses no danger. Another method in lifting the eyelid is to teach the eyelid a shape like that of the date leaf, as we have described. Then lift the eyelid with three forceps, either separated or grouped in this manner:.
Then cut the remaining eyelid with a small scissors in a moderate manner:.
If you cannot hold the probes and they do not remain steady for you, take a needle with a thread and insert it in the middle of the shape and insert another thread near the large opening and a third thread near the small opening. Gather the threads with your fingers moderately, then raise your hand moderately with them.
Lift the taught skin as we described, then suture and treat the wound until it heals. If a hot swelling appears upon cutting or incising, relieve that swelling with calamine or similar anointing medicines.
And it may happen that the lower eyelid turns inward; in which case, what we have mentioned regarding cutting, suturing, and cauterization with fire or sharp medicine should be used. Cautioning by fire or a sharp medicine is more effective and gentler for the patient than cutting and suturing. However, cutting and suturing are more thorough in such cases.
Cauterization with a cautery should be done in this manner: Turn the eyelid inside out and make a cut on the inner side as described. Then, create two thin rods or sticks, their length equal to that of the eyelid and their width less than that of a forceps.
And you should cauterize at the ends of both sides where the threads adhere. Then, gather them gently as is preferable for the eyelid. Tighten the rods from both sides tightly and leave it for days. The tightened skin dies, darkens, and rots.
Until it falls off by itself. If it heals slowly, cauterize it with a cautery, then treat it until it heals. When it adheres, the eyelid will rise and the eyelashes will not fall out. This is the image of the rods, which you should make in this shape and size, both in length and width.
The Twelfth Chapter.
Lifting the Thin Hair from the Eye with the Needle.
If it is a single hair or two hairs, the procedure is to take a fine needle and insert into it a thin smooth silk thread. Gather its ends and tie them in a very gentle knot. The length of the thread should be about a finger's breadth.
Then sew another thin thread onto the needle and insert it into the conjunctiva, and tie its ends if you wish. Then place the patient's head near the sun so that the work can be seen clearly; for this is a delicate procedure. Next, insert the needle with the thread at the root of the excess hair.
And pass it through the eyelid with the clamp until it comes out above the natural hair. Then pull the thread upwards towards the conjunctiva and insert that hair into the conjunctiva if it is one or two, or three at most.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out along with the conjunctiva in the eyelid with the natural hair. If you pulled the conjunctiva but the hair did not come out with it, pull the conjunctiva downward with the thread that you sewed into it until the conjunctiva comes out of the upper punctum.
Then insert the hair back into it and pull both of them. You do this until it rises through the upper punctum, and you will see it clearly with your eye. Then release the conjunctiva and the thread, remove them, and tighten the eyelid, leaving it tightened for two or three days until the hair takes its place and flesh grows on it.
If the hair is short, either add to it a long natural hair which will grow with it, or leave it until it grows longer and then lift it.
The Thirteenth Chapter.
In the Treatment of the Incision That Occurs in the Upper Eyelid.
That incision is called arnopia. This incision can be either natural or accidental. The accidental one occurs from the closure of a wound, a cut, a burn, and so on.
The treatment involves cutting the closure, separating its lips, and inserting a wick of cotton between them. It should then be tied until it heals. One should not use things that dry up and constrict in its treatment.
If you do that, the incision will become worse than before. Instead, use things that relax the tissue, such as hordeum (barley sprouts), fomentation with water in which I have boiled barley and cottonseeds, and ointments of diakiles that have been melted with some fat and applied to the wick.
The principle of its treatment is to strive by every means to prevent it from adhering in the same manner as before. The work we have mentioned is only part of correcting the incision; it is not about restoring the area exactly as it was originally.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In the Treatment of the Incision That Occurs in the Lower Eyelid.
This shṭarah which is from the lowest is called the true shṭarah and is natural and accidental. The accidental one is from a wound or cut or burn and the like.
The method is to take a needle with a doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left wound to the right wound so that the thread is at the ends of the flesh. Then, lift the flesh above with the needle and cut it with a wide forceps.
If the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, otherwise take a merud and place it at the site of the cut. Turn the eyelid with it and make two cuts on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of the cuts at the corners of the incision until they meet, forming an angle. Until it meets, then its shape becomes similar to this shape:.
And it is the Greek letter lambda. Then, that flesh is removed to the extent that the sharp side of it is lower than what is below the eyelid. Next, the separate parts are gathered with two needles and sewn with a silk thread. Then, it is treated with the medicines we mentioned for relaxing and suturing until it heals.
And if the shṭarah is accidental, from a cut or suture or burn, it should be incised with a simple incision without penetrating the hairs of the eyelid, as previously mentioned. Then, separate the lips with suturing as we have mentioned.
In treating the shṭarah whether from above or below, the work should be done according to what appears suitable from the form of the shṭarah, for it may differ greatly in appearance. The skilled craftsman finds a way with any means available to him.
Until the form returns to its natural shape or approximates it, and the same disease guides you as to what is suitable for it from work and machine in most cases.
Fifteenth Chapter.
On the Adhesion of the Eyelid to the Mucous Membrane or the Cornea.
This adhesion may affect many people by causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, thus preventing it from moving freely and impairing its natural functions. It should be treated by introducing a moistened wick under the eyelid.
And lift it above or stretch it with forceps, then cut the adhesion with a delicate clamp that is not as sharp as the usual clamps but is slightly dull to avoid alarming the patient during the procedure. The clamp should slip easily without injuring the eye with its sharpness, and your cut should be like peeling off that adhesion.
And expect until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the adhesion is completely healed. Then, pour saline water into the eye to wash it with it or instill it with a solution of zinc sulfate from a dropper. Next, separate the eyelid from the eye with a cotton wick.
And place over the eye a moistened cloth with egg white. After the third day, use medicated forceps until healed.
Sixteenth Chapter.
On the Cutting of the Osseous Spurs and Necrotic Tissue.
The nail is of two kinds: either it is nervously formed and resembles a soft, thin plate, or it is non-nervous and resembles white dryness that iron touches or which the forceps take, causing it to break.
No forceps were applied in it, and both kinds begin from the upper meatus gradually until they cover the observer and prevent light and eye movement. The work is done by cutting them, placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand. Next, you pick up the nail with a fine forceps, extending it upwards. Then you take a needle and insert a hair from a horse's or cow's mane or a strong thread into it, bending the tip of the needle slightly and piercing it through the middle of the nail.
And you pass it through the needle, tying the nail to the thread and extending it upwards. You peel off the side of the nail near the socket as if you were spreading it with the hair until the end. Then you cut the remaining part at the base of the socket with a delicate forceps or a small scissors, leaving the natural nasal lining intact.
To avoid the continuous flow of tears from what is cut, the nail is extended with the forceps alone or with the thread as we have said. Then you peel off the smooth forceps the tip shown in this image.
To prevent the forceps from touching the corneal conjunctiva, which could cause a perforation and injure the socket, then after the cut, you should place something from powdered salt or from colocynth in the eye and leave it for another day. Then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the nail is non-nervous and unable to receive an needle or hold a splinter, this type of nail is often treated with medications as described in the classification, and if you wish to cut it, open the affected eye.
Take a gentle smooth thin-bladed forceps and apply it to this image:. -remove the nail from above gently, grain it gently. If you see that it is loosening and breaking, only grains of zinger root powder or red incisor root powder or powdered salt on it, and tighten the eye for another day.
Then, redo the procedure until all of it is gone. If you encounter a hot tumor in the eye, leave it and treat the hot tumor until it heals, then redo the graining until it heals. As for any remaining flesh from the cauterization.
If the nodule causes severe pain in the eye, fix that nodule with a splint and cut off some of it without过度处理以免引起眼泪流出，然后滴入凹处的红根或金盏花粉末直至痊愈。
Seventeenth Chapter.
On Cutting the Verruca and What Grows Excessively in the Eye.
It may grow in some people's eyes a red excess flesh overlapping to such an extent that it covers or nearly covers the eyeball, or flows onto the eyelids. Sometimes, the eyelids may turn outward and resemble the varicose vein.
The operation is to place the patient's head in your lap, then open his eyes and grasp all that red flesh with the forceps suitable for this.
Or hold it with forceps or tongs, then cut the first piece after the other until you exhaust all of it by cutting, and preserve from the eye lest it injure it when working. Your cut should be either with the scissors we described for cutting the claws or with a small pair of forceps. As with that which you grasp the spool as shown in the chapter following this chapter.
If your cut is complete and all the red flesh has gone, fill the eye with fine salt or drop in some red cumin or similar edible medicine, and cover the eye externally with a cloth soaked in egg white to prevent hot swelling.
If there remains any red flesh and the blood overcomes you, fearing hot swelling, leave the eye and treat it with what soothes the swelling. Then return to the operation until it heals. Thus do you proceed with the excess flesh that appears in the eye of this kind.
Except that you should avoid treating any weak eye, whether due to nature or appearance, by using iron in the operation. Do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that the organ is capable of that work.
The Eighteenth Chapter.
On Lancing Spools from the Eye.
The spools are red veins that weave over the eye, causing obstruction to vision by their presence and weakening the eye with the passage of time. You should first look and see if the eye in which the spools are strong and if there is no other disease except the spools.
Then the procedure is that you direct the patient to place his head on your lap, then suspend those veins with one or two clamps according to your skill, and the clamps should be gentle in this form.
or with two double clamps in one body as shown here:.
Then you gently pick up those veins with a gentle scissors, and wipe the blood now and then until you see the eye; then those veins have disappeared and the blood has coagulated. Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be half a day facing the sun.
And you must be extremely careful in your work lest you cut anything other than those veins. When you are finished, puncture the green or red vein of the eye sharply so that its sharpness absorbs whatever remains of the blood vessels. If you cannot cut all of it in that time, apply a poultice to the eye to alleviate the pain.
And leave it for several days until the pain subsides and the hot swelling is assured. Then repeat the work on this eye in the same manner until it is cured. This is the form of the scissors to alleviate the pain.
And leave it [with the head of the patient on the learner's lap, and another to wipe away the tears and ensure vision in the front and back of the eye]. The principle in the work is to open the eye with clamps or a triangular instrument held by a learner.
Fix your gaze and place the head of the patient on the learner's lap, and another to wipe away the tears and ensure vision in the front and back of the eye. And you have the choice to begin the procedure from the top or bottom of the eye; it is better to clamp two clamps in the upper side, one at the back of the crown and the other at the front.
Hold it between the middle finger and the thumb, then suspend cannulas from opposite sides. Then hold it between the index finger and the ring finger and gently lift your hand until you see all the channels have risen. Cut from the smaller western side if you wish with scissors or with a light forceps.
You should irrigate the wound with a needle and clear all the channels until they rise to the surface of the membrane. Do not cut the suction tube, for tears and blood will mix on you.
Then cut with the scissors what exceeds the coronet from above and below so that nothing remains raw except in the horn. If possible, raise it from the horn using a needle; this is better. It may heal on its own in some people.
If you cut it, it will swell the throat for several days, relieving its pain and reducing the hot swelling. Then resume the treatment on it.
Nineteenth Section.
On Reverting the Feather to the Nose.
The doctors call the feather "nasur." If it is treated with cauterization or with a strong burning medicine as described earlier and does not heal, there is no remedy except to incise the swelling when it is ripe and to extract all the moisture or pus that is in it.
Until the bone becomes apparent. If the bone becomes apparent and you see decay or blackness in it, strip it with an instrument of this kind:
And it is called the coarse head, made from Indian iron. Its head is rounded like a nut and engraved with a delicate engraving either of a spoon or a lancet. You place it on the spot of decay in the bone, then turn it between your fingers while slightly tightening your hand until you know that that decay has been removed.
And do this several times, then apply the dried gripping medications to the area. If the site binds over and flesh grows therein, and the duration comes to an end after forty days without any recurrence and no incident occurs.
Know that it has healed, otherwise there is no remedy except to return the nasal speculum to the nose hole in this manner, which is to expose the bone again with iron or sharp medication. If the bone becomes exposed, take a probe in this form:
The tip of the probe should be triangular, with its apex rounded to a point as you can see. Place it on the bone itself, near the meatus, and keep your hand a little distance from the eye. Then, using the probe, turn your hand until the bone is felt by the patient.
He should find the air escaping from him if he places his hand on his nose. Then, apply the dried gripping medications to the area as I have instructed you. If flesh grows and the place stiffens, the material that used to flow outward will return to the nose, making this easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In Returning the Eyeball.
If the eye has prolapsed completely and there is no affliction or deficiency in vision, it should be eased first, then detached in the cleft. Then place a probe in the cleft without any difficulty, and extract it gently.
Then place on the eye a splint made from copper, brass, and horn. Tie the eye from above to the bandage with many wrappings. The method of the wrappings is to take soft cloth in small pieces, fold each piece into four folds, and make many such pieces.
Then place one on top of the other as much as the eye requires. Then tie them tightly with a strong bandage and re-suction without necessity. Then remove the suction device and leave the eye tied for a day and a night.
If the bandage relaxes during this period, it should be tightened properly. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, otherwise, reapply the dressing, supports, tightening, and suction until it returns.
The Twenty-First Chapter.
On Cutting the Umbilical Cord.
If a fistula appears in the umbilical tissue, then becomes evident and protrudes outside the eyelid, resembling an umbilical swelling and disfiguring the appearance of the person, and you intend to cut it, the procedure should be as described.
It is to insert a needle into the base of the fistula from bottom to top, then insert another needle with a doubled thread on one side and pass it through. Keep the first needle in its place.
Then cut at the point where the doubled thread bends, tie a portion of the fistula around the needle with this thread, and tighten it properly. Remove the needle and place a damp cloth of egg white over the eye. Leave it until the threads fall off with the fistula, then treat the eye to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, the fistula should be tightened from all sides with a circle of bandage until the eye swells properly. Then use a fine forceps reaching deep into the eye to release the egg white moisture and reduce the eye, causing it to shrink temporarily. Finally, tighten it until it heals.
The Twenty-Second Chapter.
In the Treatment of Contraction.
This disease, which is called contraction, is a period that gathers in the eye resembling water without any substance. The method to treat this is to place the patient on a chair upright, then take his head with both hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the period rise to the lower part of the eye with your eyes. Then, hold it in place and do not let it move while the light comes out. The patient will see the things as he used to see them. If it does not descend to the lower part, we know it is water. If it does not come down as described, proceed accordingly.
Otherwise, place the patient between your legs. Then take a thin clamp and make a small incision above the corneal membrane near the point of contact between the adherent tissue and the corneal membrane in the fornix until the material comes out.
If it comes out, pour hot water into the eye that has mixed with honey or boiled castor oil and honey. Then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
The Twenty-Third Chapter.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which is suitable for injection as explained and interpreted. Take it from there correctly. Then, you should place the patient between your legs, sitting facing the light near the sun.
And tie his healthy eye tightly and pull it tight, then raise his eyelid with your left hand if the eye with the water is the left eye or with your right hand if the right eye.
Then place the tip of the probe near the crown with a moistened end in the same part of the white of the eye near the smaller punctum. Then push the probe forcefully and turn it with your hand until it enters the white of the eye and feel that the probe has reached a hollow space.
And it should be such that the probe reaches the depth as the distance from the child to the end of the black, which is the crown of the eye. For bronze appears in the same manner to the observer as if he were looking at the eye through a clear corneal membrane, then the probe should be brought upwards to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards repeatedly. If the water comes out from its socket, then the patient will see what his sight was opened to in its socket and the probe is still in his eye. Then let him rest for a while. If the water rises, lower it again without removing the probe.
Then if it settles and does not rise, remove the probe gently while fumbling with your hand very little by very little. Then dissolve a small amount of pure Anbar salt in water and wash the eye from inside. Then place all around the outside of the eye either ghee or wet wool.
Apply rose oil and egg white and tie the healthy eye with it. As for us and the people of our time, we place on it powdered cumin with egg white, for if the probe does not enter the eye due to its hardness, since there are some whose eyes are exceedingly hard. Fain it is that thou take the clamp which is called the pierid, which is its likeness:
Pierce it with the clamp only through the ligament and do not delve deeply into the piercing; rather, it is that you touch gently upon the urethra and then insert the catheter as we have mentioned. When you are complete in your work, prepare the patient to lie securely asleep on his back in a dark room.
And he should abstain from all movements and coughing. Make his food what softens his nature. Do not move his head to the right or left at all. Let the bandage remain in place until the third day, then remove it from that dark room and test his sight.
Show him things, then replace the bandage on the seventh day. It is not fitting to do this during the treatment or after the insertion from your hour; rather, you should avoid doing so before the water rises quickly due to intense vision.
If a hot swelling appears, it is fitting to examine the eye before the seventh day and treat it with what relieves the swelling. Only then release his sight and place a veil over his face, training his vision from beneath it for days while he remains in that dark room.
He should leave the house gradually and deal with its causes. Know that the insertion is not something the learner can dispense with by merely observing a few times; only then should he proceed to the work. I have been informed that some of the Iraqis mentioned that they make an efficacious insertion in Iraq that absorbs water.
And I have not seen anyone in our land make this, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients. It may be something newly invented. These are images of various types of forceps to help you understand them due to their unfamiliarity.
It is made of brass specially, and its tip is made in this fashion with that particular type, triangular and sharp.
The Fourth and Twenty-fourth.
In the Treatment of Putrefied Flesh in the Nose.
It may grow in the nose various pieces of putrefied flesh, some of which resemble worms with many legs, and some are cancerous, hardened like a clot of blood, and some are soft and not like a clot of blood.
And if the flesh is soft and not malignant or cancerous, it should be placed facing the sun. The nostril should be opened, and the probe inserted into the flesh, then drawn out. The part that has been reached should be cut off with a sharp, gentle forceps from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone, and if there is something remaining that you cannot cut, remove it gently with one of the delicate instruments until nothing remains. If blood prevails or a hot tumor appears.
Then treat it as appropriate. If it is a malignant tumor, act quickly to incise it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone. Then insert into the nose after cutting, either dust and water or some drink. If the nose opens up, and the moisture drains to the throat.
Then know that it has healed. If the moisture does not drain as it should, know that there is putrefied flesh inside at the top of the loose bones where the instrument did not reach with the cut. At that point, you should take a thick flax thread.
It is tied in many knots and a finger's breadth or less is placed between each knot. The patient devises a trick, inserting the end of the single thread into its nostril with what it can manage after shaping it like a seed, drawing its scent until it reaches the palate.
It is drawn out through the throat. Often, boys in the scribes' circles do such a deed and it is easy for whoever wishes to do it. Then, the two ends of the thread, one that came out through the mouth and the other that remained in the nostril, are brought together.
Then, the flesh is separated by the knots in the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh has been cut by the thread's knots. Remove the thread, which will be found in the nostril after wiping away the blood. Soak it in the Egyptian ointment, and do this for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh. Then, in the nostril, a lead pipe persists for days until it heals. If further treatment is needed to dry it up, use this method.
This is a picture of the speculum with which ointments and medicines are poured into the nostril.
It is placed from silver or copper, similar to a small candleholder, open at the top and its channel likewise.
And if you prefer, the pipe is made closed like a reed, and the speculum is flattened.
It has a handle at its end as you can see, which is held when the ointment or any other liquid substance is heated in it.
The Twenty-Fifth Chapter.
On Boils in the Tip of the Nose.
Boils often appear at the tip of the nose and enlarge, increasing in size with time until they disfigure the appearance.
And therefore, it should be cut out at the first appearance and all of it should be excised. Then apply either cauterization or a burning medicine that serves the purpose of cauterization. If it has already enlarged, examine it; if it is hardened and solid like a dark color with little sensation,
If it is hardened and solid like a dark color with little sensation, do not treat it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor. I have often seen those who had this tumor cut out suffer greatly afterward. If the tumor is soft and bulging but not dark-colored, I have found that cutting it out can be done entirely. Empty the boil and cut it out without hesitation or fear, and treat the area with something that dries and constricts until it heals.
The Twenty-Sixth Chapter.
On Sewing the Nose, Lip, and Ear. If the continuity separates due to a wound or the like, know that when disconnection occurs in any of these membranes, it is rare for work to be effective except in some people.
When such a thing is presented to someone, if the wound is fresh and bleeding, stitch its lips together with缝合线, then treat it until it heals. If the separation of continuity has already separated its lips, making each split independent, it should be necessary to strip each split with a thin layer of its outer skin until it becomes moist.
Then gather the lips with suturing and tighten them, and sprinkle on them the powder of myrrh and frankincense. Place above the sutures a plaster of olive ointment or any other adhesive plaster. Leave it tightened for two or three days, then remove it.
Then change the medicine and leave it until the stitches dissolve of themselves. Then treat her with ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to gather and separate the contact either by needles as we described in suturing the abdomen, or by thread as we informed you there.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
In the Extraction of Knots That May Affect the Lips.
Many people may develop small, hard tumors within their lips, some resembling chestnut burrs and others varying in size. It should be noted that the lip should be turned and incised at each knot, and the tumor should be removed using forceps.
Then cut it from every side. After cutting, fill the area with powdered honey until the bleeding stops. Rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas to contract until the wounds heal.
The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
On the Cutting of Excess Flesh in the Gum.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gum, which the ancients called apobasis. It should be grasped with forceps or pinched with a clamp and cut at its base. Allow the wound to bleed or let it heal naturally. Then place powdered honey over the area.
or one of the contracted dried vessels, if that flesh returns after treatment, it often returns again. Cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
In Counting Teeth with Iron.
Foul, rough scales may gather on the surfaces of the teeth from within and without, between the gums. These may turn black, yellow, or green, causing decay in the gums and disfigurement of the teeth.
It is necessary to sit the patient before you and his head on your lap. Extract the tooth and the tooth in which you see the scales and sand-like substance until nothing remains. Similarly, do this for the blackness, greenish color, yellowing, and other such things until you cleanse.
If what is in the first counting is gone, otherwise, re-count it another day and again until you reach your goal. Know that the tooth requires different types of forceps with various shapes and many forms according to what suits your work.
The forceps used to extract a tooth from within are different from those used from outside, and the ones used between teeth have another shape. These are various types of forceps, all prepared for you.
Chapter Thirty.
On Extracting Teeth.
It is necessary to treat the tooth for its pain with every means and delay extracting it if possible, for there is no use in extracting it as it is a noble organ. Yet, if extraction becomes necessary, do not hesitate.
If it is determined that the tooth should be extracted, you must wait until the pain is certain. Often, the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in the correct tooth and extracts it. Then, the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted; we have seen this happen repeatedly with cuppers.
If the tooth is certain to be painful, then you must apply force with a forceps around the tooth to loosen the gum on all sides. Then, move it with your fingers or with gentle probes gradually until it becomes loose.
Then, firmly grasp the two main probes with both hands and hold the painful area between your knees to secure it so that it does not move. Pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, use one of those instruments and gently insert it from all sides under the tooth, then move and shake it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or loose, you should fill the hole with a piece of cloth and tightly pack it well with a thin moistened tip to prevent it from breaking while pulling with the probes. You should also probe around the gum on all sides thoroughly.
And preserve your effort so that you do not break it, for if some of it remains, it will cause the patient greater discomfort than his original pain. Be careful not to do as the ignorant cuppers do, rushing to extract it without using what we have described.
Often they cause great misfortunes to people, the lesser of which is that a tooth may break and its root or some of its roots may remain. And if it is removed with some bones of the jaw as we have often witnessed, then he should gargle after its removal with a drink or with salt and vinegar. If bleeding occurs from the place, it often happens in such cases that you should crush a bit of vinegar and apply it to the area.
And if the vinegar does not help, use gentle forceps to move the tooth first. These should be long-tipped and short-cylindrical with a thick handle to prevent them from bending when grasped at the tip on the tooth. This is the image of the larger forceps.
They should be as you see, thick at the handles so that when gripped they do not bend and are long-tipped. They should be made of Indian iron or well-tempered steel with points on their tips that fit into each other for a firm and tight grip.
And the tips can be made like those of a probe, also providing a strong grip.
The third and twentieth chapter.
On the Extraction of Tooth Roots and the Removal of Broken Jawbones.
If a root breaks during the extraction of a tooth, it should be covered with cotton soaked in oil for one or two days until the area relaxes, then the forceps or forceps-like instrument can be inserted. That which resembles its ends the beak of the bird that is called blerage; and this is an image of the forceps.
You have made it like a forceps from within or like a scissor. If this does not work for removal with the forceps, you should dig at the root and expose all the flesh with the probe, then insert the instrument which resembles a small pincers, as shown in this image.
Short at the end, a little thick, and do not make it too thin so that it does not break. If the root comes out with this, otherwise use these other instruments shown here, the first one is triangular at the end with some thickness.
A triangular delicate other:
We may also use this instrument with two branches, as shown here in this image:
And with other instruments and metals mentioned in the inventory of teeth. We may also use this instrument that resembles a large forceps, as shown here in this image.
Triangular at the end, bent, with some thickness to prevent it from breaking, and not too thin. Know that instruments for teeth are many, and so are other instruments; they cannot be counted. And a skilled craftsman can invent new ones according to what his work and diseases themselves suggest.
Because there are diseases for which the ancients did not make instruments, since the bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth may break or decay, search for it in its place using one of these instruments and forceps mentioned for extracting the root.
We rely on this with its illustration.
It should have some hardness only to fix the bone so that it does not move until the bone comes out, and we reinforce the place with appropriate medicines, if the bone has a slight decay, we remove its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
The Thirty-second Chapter.
On the Extraction of Teeth Growing Over Others.
If a tooth grows in an abnormal position, it spoils the appearance of the teeth. This is especially true for women and slaves. You should examine whether the tooth has grown behind another tooth.
If it is not possible to extract or push it back, remove it. If it is attached to another tooth, remove it with this instrument, as shown in its illustration.
And it resembles a small bird's beak. Let it be made of sharp iron, and cut it off in several days due to the hardness of the tooth. To avoid disturbing other teeth, use a refrigerant from India if the tooth is loose and firm. Here is its illustration.
It should be entirely made of Indian metal, with a very fine engraving, similar to the needle refrigerant. Cool the tooth gradually over several days with care to avoid loosening it and causing it to fall out. Then wrap it tightly at the end and remove it with some forceps.
If a tooth has broken and the break causes pain to the tongue when speaking, it should also be cooled to eliminate the sharpness of the break and make it smooth so that it does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
The Thirty-Third Chapter.
In joining移动翻译结果：在连接活动的牙齿用银线或金线。请确认是否继续以阿拉伯文呈现，还是需要调整为中文？如果需要保留原文格式，请告知。
If the front teeth wobble or move due to a blow or fall and the patient is unable to bite on anything to prevent them from falling, treat it with contracting medicines but if the treatment does not work.
The remedy is to tie a thread of gold or silver, with gold being preferable because silver rusts and corrodes after a few days, while gold remains unchanged forever. The thread should be medium in thickness, neither too soft nor too hard, to fit the space between the teeth.
A diagram of the joining process is as follows: Take the thread and introduce its bend between the correct teeth. Then weave the ends of the thread between the moving tooth or teeth until the weaving reaches the correct tooth on the other side.
Then, reweave back to the side where you started. Tighten your thread gently and wisely so that it does not move at all. Secure the thread at the roots of the teeth to prevent it from coming loose. Cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, tie them together, and hide them between the correct tooth and the moving tooth.
To avoid injuring the tongue, then leave it tightened as is for the remainder of the time. If it loosens or breaks, tighten it with another thread so that it can be used for the rest of its duration. This is a diagram of the teeth and the method of joining two correct teeth with two moving teeth, as you can see.
One or both teeth may fall out and return to their place, interlock as we have described, and remain. This is done by a companion who makes a path, and he may carve a piece of cow bone into the shape of a tooth and place it in the spot where the tooth fell out. It is pulled as we have said and remains, providing relief.
The Forty-Third Chapter.
In cutting the ligament that is located under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament that is found under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or it may be accidental, resulting from a wound that healed.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth and place his head on your lap, lift the tongue, then cut that external nerve ligament so that the tongue is released from its constriction. If there is some stiffness and complexity, and this is due to a healed wound, insert a probe and cut the ligament externally until the ligament detaches and the constriction resolves.
Be careful that the cut does not go too deep into the flesh, as this may sever a blood vessel causing bleeding. After cutting, gargle with rose water or vinegar and cold water. Then place a cotton wick under the tongue, which the patient should hold every night.
To prevent it from sticking again, if bleeding occurs, apply a freshly moistened powder to the area. If the bleeding persists, iron the spot with a lens-shaped ironing tool that is suitable for this purpose. Then treat him with all other treatment until he recovers.

A swelling resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue and prevent it from performing its natural functions, and it might even become a bone to fill the mouth. The treatment for this is to open the patient's mouth towards the sun and examine the swelling.
If you see it pale or dark and hard, and the patient does not feel any sensation in it, do not touch it, as it is a cancer. If it is inclined towards being white with moisture, lance it with a sharp probe and incise it gently, and extract it from all sides.
If the bleeding prevails over you while performing the procedure, apply a poultice of powder until the bleeding stops. Then return to completing your work until you remove it entirely, and gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat him with all other appropriate treatment until he recovers.
The Thirty-Sixth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Swellings in the Tonsils.
And swellings that develop in the throat, like other tumors, may involve glands inside the throat that resemble those found outside and are called tonsils. If these are treated as described in the classification but do not recover,
Then examine it. If the swelling is hard, pale in color, and has little sensation, do not treat it with iron. If it is red in color and its origin is thick, also do not treat it with iron to avoid bleeding. Instead, leave it alone until it matures; either it will dry up or it will burst on its own.
And if it is white in color and round, and its origin is tender, this is what should be cut, and the work therein that you should do is to look before working whether its hot swelling has ceased completely or decreased somewhat.
And then sit the patient with his face towards the sun and his head on your knee and open his mouth and take a spatula between your hands and press his tongue down with this instrument, its image is as follows:.
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press it on the tongue and see the swelling clearly with your eyes, take forceps and insert it into the gland and draw it out as much as possible without pulling any of the vessels along with it.
Then cut it with an instrument like this, its image is as follows: it resembles scissors but both ends are bent, each one fitting into the other sharply. It is made of Indian iron or Damascus steel:.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with forceps as shown in its image:.
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one gland, cut the other in the same manner. Then, after cutting, irrigate the patient with cold water or with vinegar and water.
If he experiences bleeding, irrigate with water in which the peel of the pomegranate or the leaves of the laurel or similar astringent substances have been steeped until the bleeding stops. Then treat him until he recovers. And if other swellings appear in the throat besides the glands, cut them as you have been instructed for cutting the glands, equally.
And I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, striking the larynx slightly in its sense, nearly blocking the throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and this had prevented her from eating and drinking water.
And she would have died if she had survived for one or two days. The tumor had grown to produce two branches that protruded through the openings of her nostrils. I acted urgently and inserted a needle into one of them, then pulled it out, extracting a suitable piece with it.
Then I cut it where I encountered it through the nasal opening. I did the same for what protruded through the other nasal opening. Then I opened her mouth, pressed her tongue, and inserted the needle into the tumor itself. I cut a portion of it, and all that came out was a little blood.
Then the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water. She also started eating again. We continued to cut from that tumor repeatedly for a long time, and the tumor would leave a replacement in place of what we cut until this lasted for a long time for both of us.
I treated and cauteryed the tumor inside the throat from above, stopping its growth. Then I left that area and did not know what Allah had done to it after me.
The Seventh and Thirty-First Chapter.
On Cutting a Tumor of the Hyoid Bone.
Which is called Unba if it descends to the hyoid bone and swells, being white and rectangular; if it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called Unba. If treated with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment proves ineffective.
I have seen the hot tumor abate, and it became thin; therefore, it should be cut out. And if it was not joined together in a round manner and did not have length, and was either purple or black or had no sensation, then it should be avoided being cut.
If there is uncertainty about the condition, when you see it as white and long as described, you should place the patient's hand under the solar plexus and press its tongue with the instrument described earlier, then insert the needle into the vein.
You should pull it downward and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned for cutting the parotid glands. It is best not to cut more than what exceeds the natural size, for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech.
After the cut, use what we described for cutting the parotid glands and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid to undergo the cutting, you should apply the alternative method without fear or hesitation. The reason for using this cautery method is with sharp medication; you should place the patient's head on your lap.
Then press its tongue with the instrument we mentioned. Next, take the sharp water described in the section on cautery and mix it with unextinguished ghee, making it neither thick nor thin. Fill the trough of this instrument with it; this is its shape.
Its end where you place the medication should have a trough like that of a spoon. Place the instrument with the medication on the tongue itself, and the patient lying on their side to allow saliva to flow out from inside their throat so that nothing drops down into their throat and hurts them.
Then hold your hand with the remedy and squeeze it on the blister for half an hour until you see it has turned black and the bite of the remedy has calmed down. If you wish, take a cotton cloth and wrap its end around the needle, then dip the cotton in the remedy.
You insert the needle with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton sticks to the blister. Do this repeatedly until you reach what you want for branding the grapevine. Then leave it, as it will wilt and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the remedy, you do so.
After branding, wipe around the grapevine with cotton soaked in oil and dry what is around it from the remedy. Then gargle with cold water and treat externally with poultices and internally with irrigations until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and less fearful.
And the blister can also be treated with what is gentler than branding and cutting. It is treated with incense prepared in this manner: Fustic, Zedoary, Chiretta, Sudobium, Sheh, Bupleurum, Cyperus, and similar herbs from weeds are gathered, either all of them or some of them, in a pot and steeped in vinegar.
And it is boiled with the pot lined with clay of wisdom. There should be a hole in the center of the lid, on which the dried apparatus is placed in this manner: It is made of silver or copper.
Then insert the end containing the reed into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the blister through the tube, causing the blister to rupture. Do this repeatedly until it wilts. Be sure not to prepare this treatment in the early stages of the swelling.
Frequently, it increases in the swelling. Only then should you do so when the hot swelling subsides. If this instrument is not available, take a cane and attach to its end a piece of eggshell so that the patient's mouth does not burn.
Because the eggshell prevents the steam's heat from burning the mouth, this is good for both treatment and safety.
The Thirty-Eighth Chapter.
For the Extraction of Thorns and What May Become Embedded in the Throat.
Frequently, a bone or a thorn or something similar becomes embedded in the throat. You should extract what is visible after pressing the tongue with the instrument when the sun is shining.
Let it be clear to you what is in the throat and what is hidden therein and has not become visible. You should induce vomiting in the patient before his food settles in his stomach, for the embedded object may come out through vomiting or the patient might swallow a piece of rag or a root.
Or he might swallow a piece of dry bread. Alternatively, you should take a piece of sponge that is soft and flexible, tie it in a thread, and have him swallow it. When it reaches the location of the thorn, pull the thread quickly. You should do this several times.
For frequently, the thorn or bone sticks in such a way and can be extracted. If it does not come out as mentioned, then use an instrument made of brass shaped like this:
It should be thicker than the probe slightly, and at its end, there is a hook that the patient inserts into his throat gently while raising his head above. He should take care not to touch his windpipe to avoid causing coughing, and either he pushes the bone or thorn with it or the doctor inserts it by hand.
And the introduction of the probe to her is better for his knowledge of the place of the prolapsed thing, and it drives it downward or draws his hand with the instrument upward; all of this according to what he finds convenient until it is removed.
The Thirty-Ninth Chapter.
On the Removal of the Prolapsed Thing in the Throat.
If the prolapsed thing is treated with the medicine as described in the division of treatment, and if it does not succeed, then examine the probe at the throat after pressing his tongue with the instrument described to you.
If your sight falls on the prolapsed thing, draw it with a small forceps or a fine, tight tweezers. If you are not able to do so, then take a hollow tube and introduce it into the throat near the prolapsed thing. Then insert a heated iron into the hollow tube.
You do this several times. The prolapsed thing should abstain from water all day. Then give him a cup full of cold water and open his mouth wide, allowing him to gargle without swallowing even a drop. Occasionally move the water around with your hand.
If the prolapsed thing drops out when it senses water, then it should be removed as described. If it does not come out, then sprinkle the throat with urine and use the instrument described for burning incense to fumigate the throat. Do this several times; it will drop out.
And the procedure for fumigation is as follows: Take a quantity of embers that have been heated with fire and place it in a pot covered with a lid, making sure there is a hole in the center of the lid. Attach the end of the instrument to this hole. Then throw incense on the embers. Place the prolapsed thing's mouth over the open end of the tube, ensuring that its mouth is closed so that the fumigation does not escape until it is clear that the fumigation has reached its throat.
If the clot falls into place, then it has fallen. If not, incense should be used several times and the patient should endure the thirst, eat salty food and garlic, and not drink water. It must come out through this arrangement. This is an image of the instrument that attracts the clot from the throat when sight falls upon it.
And it resembles the calabash as you see, except that it has this spout which enters the throat, and its ends resemble the beak of a bird. Inside, there is roughening if it touches anything, it will not leave it.
And another instrument to press the tongue. It is a wide ring of iron as large as the mouth will hold above the tongue. It enters the mouth standing on one side, so that the mouth remains open without the patient's willing it, and he cannot dislodge it at all until it is removed.
The description of the instrument by which the mouth is opened in accordance with this same measurement.
Chapter Forty.
It deals with the speech concerning the expansion of tumors and incising them.
Tumors are of many kinds, varied according to what will be mentioned one by one in this book. They differ in their expansion and incision from two perspectives: the first is related to the type of tumor itself and what it contains of moist substances.
The second type is based on the locations where they occur in the body, for a tumor that occurs in the head is different from one that occurs in the neck. A tumor that occurs in muscle tissue is different from one that occurs in a joint. Each has its own treatment.
And some tumors should not be treated until the pus is ripe and complete, and among them are those that should be treated while they are not completely ripe, such as tumors that are near the joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and takes time to develop, corrupting what is around it, perhaps it will damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, becoming a cause for the disability of that limb or making the tumor close to a vital organ.
Because if you delay treating it until it ripens, you will harm the vital organ. Or it may be near the perineum, so you should treat it intentionally while it is not completely ripe. Only then is it necessary to treat the tumor intentionally while it is not fully ripe, to prevent corruption of the surrounding tissue and from entering the perineum, becoming dangerous.
And it will become, to a certain degree, incurable. You should know the time to treat tumors that are completely ripe, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, fever disappears, redness and swelling diminish, and the head of the tumor becomes soft along with all other signs.
You should locate the puncture at the lowest part of the tumor if possible, to make it easier for the pus to drain downward, or at the most tender part and most tubular. The puncture should be made along the length of the body if the tumors are in areas like the arms and legs.
And for muscle locations, tendon locations, nerve locations, and blood vessel locations, and in general, all flat areas without curvature. As for curved areas, the puncture should be made according to that location. If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to avoid puncturing it.
Until its maturity is complete as we said, if you compress it before that, its pus will remain for a long time and be both abundant and foul. It may even harden its lips and darken its color, and some tumors may become compressed where the body is narrow out of necessity or according to what the organ requires.
It should be compressed with one compression for small tumors and with a wide compression or many incisions according to the size of the tumor. Some tumors may require that the skin be drawn and cut if they have become like rags.
It has reached a point where some have died, as is often seen in many abscesses and hidden infections. Some require an incision with three corners, while others are cut to resemble the shape of a leaf, like the tumor of the liver.
Some require an incision with a circular cut, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions. For those without a head, such as flat, hairless tumors, it should be compressed with a simple compression only. If the tumor is large and has accumulated over a long period of time, it should not be compressed too much to avoid expelling all the pus at once.
But expel some of it, then compress the tumor until another day, and then expel some of the pus as well. You do this gradually until all is expelled.
And especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly frail person. The vital spirit often dissolves suddenly with the expulsion of pus, and the patient may die without you realizing it. Therefore, be extremely cautious with this matter.
After treating these tumors, one should clean the wound and examine it. If the wound of the tumor is small or if there is a single simple incision, use catgut or old cotton for suturing. If the tumor is large and has many incisions, this should be done accordingly.
You should insert a wick into each incision until they reach one another. If part of the skin has been cut from the tumor or drawn in, it should be filled with old cotton or dry catgut and tied for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with ointments as necessary until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a piece of cotton in them and apply it to the bleeding area several times.
If the bleeding continues, you should use the management and treatment, as well as the leeches that we have described in many places of this our book. From the classification, if it is winter and the area of the tumor has many nerves, you should warm the bandages with hot decoction and oil.
You should place them on the area. If it is summer and the areas are fatty, you should apply the bandages soaked in cold water and oil, or in a cold decoction and oil. As we said, by the third day, the tumor should be resolved and cleaned.
You should use what is similar for its treatment until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed methods, I have described each tumor and the way to treat it, organized and summarized.
The Forty-First Chapter.
In切分头皮上的肿块。
Tumors that appear in the scalp are small and belong to the kinds of sloughs contained in follicles, which have conditions resembling a chicken's crop. They are of various types; some are fatty, and some contain moisture resembling mucus.
And some contain moisture resembling soups and stews and the like. Some are hardened and solid. All of them pose no danger in incising and removing them, unless you encounter a vein when incising them.
The procedure for incising them is to probe it first with the instrument whose image will be provided next, which is called the probe, until you know what it contains. If what it contains is moisture, then incise it lengthwise with a simple cut as shown in this illustration.
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~j~. Once the moisture has drained, remove and completely cut the sac that contained it, leaving nothing at all. Often, it returns if even a small part is left.
Then, immerse a cotton pad in the pure ointment if it is ready; otherwise, use salt water. Fill the wound with it and leave it until the next day. It will eat away what remains of the sac. Then, reapply the cotton pad with the Egyptian ointment again, or a third time if needed.
Until you are certain that there is nothing left of the sac. Then, treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains a fatty slough, incise it as shown in this illustration.
شقّا مصلّبا والق الصنانير في شفتى الجرح واسلخه من كلّ جهة ورُم جهدك في إخراج الصفاق الذي يحويها، فإن اعترضك شريان فاصنع ما وصفت لك بعد وكذلك فاصنع في الورم إن كان متحجرا من الشقّ.
والعلاج بعينه على ما ذكرت، والشقّ على الورم المتحجّر أسهل لأنّه قليل الدم والرطوبة وقد يكون بعض هذه الأورام التى في الرأس في بعض الناس لا رطوبة معها البتّة وذلك أنّى شققت على ورم في.
رأس امرأة عجوز فألفيت الورم كالحجر الصلد خشنا أبيض لم يستطع على كسره ولو رمى به أحد لشجّه، وما كان من سائر الأورام الحادثة في الرأس غير هذه كالأورams التى تعرض في رؤوس الصبيان.
وعند أصول الآذان فشقّها كلّها شقّا بسيطا واجعل بطّها من أسافلها ليسهل جري المادّة إلى أسفل ثمّ عالجها بما يوافقها من العلاج.
الفصل الثاني والأربعون.
في الشقّ على الخنازير التي تعرض في العنق كثيرا ما تتعرض هذه الأورام في العنق وتحت الإبطين وفي الأربيتين وقد تتعرض في سائر الجسم ويكون الذي يعرض في العنق منها واحدة ويكون كثيرة ويتولد بعضها من بعض.
وكلّ خنزيرة منها تكون في داخل صفاق خاصّ لها كما يكون في السلع وأورام الرأس كما وصفنا، وأنواع هذه الخنازير كثيرة منها متحجّرة ومنها ما تحوى رطوبات ومنها خبيثة لا تجيب إلى العلاج.
I have found none of them in good condition upon touch, and their appearance is closely resembling the skin color. They move in every direction and were not adherent to the nerve of the neck, nor to the vein, and were not deep. It is necessary to incise it with a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this manner from line ~ج~ to line ~ب~:.
And strip it from every side and spread the skin flaps with forceps or two forceps or many forceps if needed as we said regarding tumors of the head. Remove it little by little, ensuring that you do not cut a vein or a nerve. Let the forceps not be sharply pointed.
Lest you increase the cut with your hand or distress the patient by cutting what you do not need to cut. If you cut a vein or a artery and thereby hinder your work, apply a paste of powder or some coagulants that stop the bleeding.
And tighten the wound and leave it until the tumor's sharpness subsides and the wound relaxes and shows signs of suppuration. Then, when the blood flow ceases, return to your work until you finish. Then, use your third finger to examine if any more small abscesses remain, cut them, and cleanse the area.
If there is a large vein at the base of the abscess, it should not be cut from its root. Rather, it should be tied off tightly with a double thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm. Then, stuff the wound with old cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treat it accordingly.
And if the pig's cheek is cut entirely, it should be gathered and sutured at once after you are certain that there is not the least bit remaining. If you see that a bit has remained due to the size of the pig's cheek.
It should be intended to cut to its depth and base, and use suturing along with what we have mentioned, and what concerns pigs containing wetness, bathe it lightly where you can see the place of its maturity and make the bathing downward as we said.
Then use after the bathing fomentation with the Egyptian ointment or similar to eat away what remains of the decay. Until you see that the wound has cleared, then treat it with ointments that promote fleshing until it heals.
The Fourth and Forty-Third Chapter.
In cutting into the throat for a swelling that occurs within the throat.
The earlier ones described this cutting into the throat. I have not seen anyone in my country perform it, and this is consistent with their remarks. As for those who have sore throat, it should be avoided to cut into the throat as they do not benefit from it.
To ensure that all the glands and the lung are healthy, and as for those who have a hot swelling in the mouth or throat or the tonsils where it is not due to the trachea, it is necessary to perform cutting into the throat to avoid the corruption that results from suffocation.
If we wish to do this, it should be cut into the throat under three circles of the tracheal rings or four small cuts across between two circles, the size of the cut being in the membrane and not in the cartilage. This place is appropriate for the cut.
Because it is without flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it, if the physician is cowardly it would be appropriate to extend the neck skin with forceps then to cut the skin until reaching the trachea avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the pharynx as described, and judge the cutting of the trachea by the mucus that comes out with it and the stopping of voice. Leave the wound open for some time. When the time he feared suffocation has passed, gather the skin lips of the wound.
And his plan is without the cartilage, then use the medicines that promote flesh growth until he recovers. Said the author of this book: The explanation of the sentence we have narrated is: if they see the patient's throat has been blocked by one of these tumors they mentioned.
And the patient is most at risk of death, and his own fear is that he might suffocate. They resorted to cutting the throat so the patient could breathe partially through the wound and avoid death. But they were ordered to leave the wound open until the course of the disease passes, which takes about three days or so.
Then they were ordered to suture the wound and treat it until he recovers. And as I have seen with my own eyes, a servant took a knife and cut part of his trachea on his throat. I was called to treat him, and found him weakening as one would for a slaughtered animal. I examined the wound.
I found the blood that came out of the wound to be very little, so I concluded that she had not cut any veins or arteries. The air was escaping through the wound, so I sutured the wound and treated it until he recovered. The servant did not suffer anything except for a hoarse voice, nothing more.
She recovered after days to her best condition, from which we say that cutting the throat poses no danger.
The Fourth and Forty-First Chapter.
Regarding the cutting for a swelling that occurs in the throat from outside and is called a phlyctenular swelling of the throat.
This swelling that is called a phlyctenular swelling of the throat is a large tumor in color and is common in women. It is of two kinds.
Either it is natural and beyond treatment, or it is incidental and requires two types of treatment. One type resembles the fatty lymph nodes, and the other resembles a tumor from the entanglement of the vessel. In cutting into it, there is danger. It should not be treated with iron at all, except for what is small and you probe it with forceps and find it resembling the fatty lymph nodes and not attached to any vessel. In such a case, cut into it as you would cut into the fatty lymph nodes. And remove it along with whatever it contains from the囊中，如果在囊中，则取出其囊内物；否则，彻底清除之，然后根据治疗需要处理该部位。
The Fifth and Forty-First Chapter.
Regarding the cutting for types of fatty lymph nodes.
Fatty lymph nodes have many types, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a fatty lymph node and an abscess, as this can be confusing. I say that an abscess is accompanied by fever, inflammation, and frightening pains until its inflammation subsides. The decay completes then the fever and sharpness cease, and the sore is not with it either heat nor fever nor pain, and it is contained in a serous cyst which is a special pouch and has the color of the body and its beginning like a pea and becomes like a bean and larger or smaller.
And it is of two kinds: either fatty or it contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many as mentioned in the division. Therefore, when you proceed to treat the sore, you should first probe it and examine it with the instrument called the探针，其图示将在接下来的章节中给出。
By estimating the size of the tumor, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after its removal. If watery moisture of any color comes out, make a slight incision as described for other tumors in the relevant section. If no watery moisture comes out after the removal of the probe, know that it is fatty.
Make the incision firm as shown in this diagram, as I have instructed you. Hang it with the tubes and carefully remove the skin from all sides. If possible, preserve the cyst and ensure that you extract it intact along with the sore.
If the cyst ruptures during the procedure and you cannot extract it intact, this often occurs. Extract it piece by piece until nothing remains. If any part of it is left, whether less or more, the sore may复发或恶化。
If it overcomes you and a small part remains, deepen the incision when you are done with some of the sharp, consuming stitches and tighten the incision. Place something on top that soothes the hot swelling and treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If the sore is large, suture its edges and treat it with suturing agents.
If a vein, whether harmful or not, appears and causes bleeding, apply powdered styptic to the affected area immediately and keep it绷紧两天或三天，直至伤口腐烂、血热平息后再处理剩余的伤处。请注意，这里的“绷紧”在医学上下文中意为“保持绷紧”，可能是指包扎或固定。

In Images of Instruments.
That act on the deep and superficial parts, images of the forceps are three kinds: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
Image of a Large Forceps:.
Image of a Medium Forceps:.

It is made from tempered iron with square edges to facilitate its entry into tumors. These are images of the probes, called "brad" in Arabic, and they also come in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a Large Probe:.
Image of a Medium Probe:.
Image of a Small Probe:.
It is suitable for examining tumors, wounds, sinuses, and cavities to detect what is inside them, such as bones. It is made round, polished, and smooth like a scaler from Chinese brass, Spanishbrass, or regular brass, or iron, or silver. The best is made from Spanishbrass.
And taps may also be made of black lead and are suitable to cleanse the tubes that have a curvature within them, so that they yield to such curvature with their flexibility. They are also three kinds, for some are long, and some are middle-sized, and some are short.
And according to the depth of each tube and its width or narrowness, make a tap from large lead.
A tap from medium lead.
A tap from small lead.
Images of the catheters, for they are many kinds. For some are simple, meaning those with a single scoop, and these are three kinds: large, medium, and small. And there are blind catheters, which are also three kinds. And there are catheters with scoops that have curvatures, also three kinds. And they are three kinds. For some catheters have three scoops, and these are three kinds as well. All these tubes need to be in their respective places. An image of a simple large cannula. An image of a simple medium cannula. An image of a simple small cannula.

This is a figure of the scalpel used for cutting and excising goods and tumors. There are three types, for some are large, some medium, and some small. Figure of a large scalpel.
Figure of a medium scalpel.
Figure of a small scalpel.
Its edges, with which it cuts, are limited, while the other parts are unlimited. This is done so that it can be used to excise the tumor when there is a fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and it provides some relief to the patient from the pain he experiences during the excision of the swelling.
This is a figure of the forceps, which are three types, for some are large, some medium, and some small. Figure of a large forceps.
It is made from brass that is half-tempered and can be smoothed. On one end, it resembles a wide spoon made of two layers, with a forceps blade hidden in its head, resembling a bird's tongue, which can be moved inward and outward as desired, as you can see.
The image of forceps which cover between the fingers when grasping tumors so that the patient does not feel them, and there are three types because some are large, medium, and small. The image of a large forceps:.
The image of the scissors used to stop bleeding, and there are three types because some are large, medium, and small. The image of the large scissors:.
It is made from brass or from copper, turned slightly to the length as you see, and should be thin. These types of scissors should be large and small so that they can cut blood quickly when needed and when no medicine is available.
But do not use them for cutting blood in every part of the body; rather, use them only in muscular areas such as the thigh muscle, the calf muscle, the arm muscle, the chest muscle, the abdominal muscles, and similar wet, fleshy muscles.
And you can make smaller instruments from them, resembling the shells of almonds as shown here:.
It is used to stop blood if it flows from a fistula or when cutting a vein or artery. You can make similar instruments as shown here:.
The Seventh and Forty-Second Chapter:.
In treating the swelling of men's breasts.
Which resembles women's breasts may swell in some people upon fullness of the dream until it resembles women's breasts and remains warm and ugly. Therefore, whoever dislikes this should incise the breast with a semilunar cut of this shape.
From line ~ب~ to line ~ج~:. Then strip off all the fat, then fill the wound with the medicated ointment, then suture the wound's lips and treat it until it heals. If the breast inclines downward and relaxes due to its bone as is common in women, let it be.
Then it should be incised on its upper sides with two cuts that resemble semilunar shapes, each connecting to the other at their ends, so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one as shown in this figure:. From line ~ب~ to line ~ج~, then strip the skin between the incisions and remove the fat. Use what we have mentioned regarding suturing and drains, and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If it does not drain enough, you should cut what needs to be cut for relief of the patient or due to blood loss. Then, you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in the ointment and leave it until it absorbs the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
The Eighth and Forty-Third Chapter.
On the Pitting of Tumors That Appear under the Armpit.
These tumors that appear under the arm are of a pig's nature, solid, contained in a sac, and some contain moisture. Of those containing moisture, it should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~, if all the pus in the tumor is evacuated, stuff it with dry cotton and leave it for another day. Then remove the cotton.
And it is treated with the ointment suitable for it until it heals. If the tumor is of the nature of pig's lumps, cut it as we mentioned in cutting the pig's lump. Whether the wound persists and discharges pus, apply cauterization as we described earlier.
The Forty-Ninth Chapter.
In cutting the tumor that appears from the artery or vein and is called aneurysm.
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, this often results in a tumor. Similarly, the vein may also appear swollen and tumorous.
The signs by which one can recognize whether the tumor and swelling are due to an artery or a vein: If the tumor is due to the artery, it is rectangular and gathered in depth within the body. When you press on the tumor with your finger, you feel it as if it has a pulsation.
The tumor that is due to the vein is round on the surface of the body. Cutting into these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the arm pit, armpit, neck, and many other parts of the body, and it can be extremely large. It should be avoided treating them with iron.
And whatever of it is in the extremities or in the head, one should avoid. What is of it, swelling at the mouth of the vessel, incise on the skin a cut lengthwise then open the cut with forceps then strip the vessel and free it from its sheaths.
Until it becomes clear, then introduce a needle underneath and puncture it to the other side, and tighten the vessel with a double-thread at two points as you have been taught for tightening the vessels in the cheeks. Then incise with forceps the place between the ligaments until all the blood comes out.
And the swelling dissolves, then use the treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off. Then treat it with ointments appropriate for that until it heals.
And if the swelling is due to incision of the vein, it should be grasped with as much of the swelling as possible along with the skin by your hand. Then a needle should be inserted below the place you have grasped with your hand and put a double-thread in it until it is punctured on the other side. Then tie the swelling with it tightly, as you have been told for tying the umbilical cord with both ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads may slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the crossing point of the first needle.
And tighten your threads at four places, then incise the swelling in its center. When what is inside comes out, cut the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then apply a dressing that has been soaked in a mixture of wine and oil. Then use the treatment which consists of catgut and ointments until he is cured.
The Fifty-Fifth Chapter.
Concerning the tumor that appears from the twisting of the nerve.
A tumor may appear in the nerve if it is struck or subjected to excessive fatigue or something similar. This is more common in the elbows and ankles.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a sensitive tumor whose color resembles that of the rest of the body. It is usually painless, but if pressed with force, the patient feels a sensation like numbness. The tumor does not gather deeply within the body.
But it is beneath the skin and moves in every direction without going forward or backward. If it is in a joint, it should not be treated with iron instruments, as it might cause harm for some time. If it is on the head or the forehead, this does not apply.
Surgical the skin with forceps. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it off at the root. If it is large, clamp it with a forceps, remove it, suture the wound, and treat it until he is cured.
The Fifty-First Chapter.
Concerning the Cutting of Wartles That Appear on the Abdomen.
They may appear often on some people in their abdomens and throughout their bodies. These warts, called fungoid, resemble fungi. Their base is delicate, while their heads are hard. They may grow into small warts or become greatly enlarged.
I have seen a man in whose belly there were two worms that resembled living creatures, without any thin white root. Their lips had changed and cracked, and moisture constantly flowed from them. I cut them out and their weight was about eighteen ounces in one and six ounces in the other.
The work in cutting them is to look and see if the affected part is moist and if the color of the worm is white and wet, with a thin root. Cut it with a broad forceps. Have the cauterizing iron ready in the fire, for often much blood rushes out when they are cut.
If the blood overcomes you, cauterize them. If you see the affected part timid and afraid of being cut with iron, take a tightly wound wire of lead and pull the worm of this kind with it. Leave it for two days, then increase the tension of the lead. Continue to tighten the lead.
The more it affects the worm until it breaks and falls off by itself without effort, if the worm has a thick root, there is some fear and uncertainty in cutting it, especially one found in the belly. But it may be possible to cut half of it or part of it.
Then cauterize it lest it return, and then treat it until the wound heals. Beware that you do not cut a worm that is pale in color, has little sensation, and is unappealing to look at, for it is a cancerous tumor. We will discuss cancer after this.
The Fifty-Second Chapter.
In the Treatment of Worms in the Rectum.
كون نتو السرّة من أسباب كثيرة إما من انشقاق الصفاق الذي على البطن فيخرج منه الثرب أو المعاء على ما يعرض في سائر الفتوق وإما من دم ينبعث من وريد أو شريان على ما تقدّم وإما من ريح تحتقن فيه.
فإن كان من قبل انشقاق الصفاق وخروج الثرب فإنّه يكون لون الورم شبيها بلون الجسد ويكون ليّنا من غير وجع ويظهر مختلف الوضع. وإن كان من قبل خروج المعاء فيكون وضعه مع ما وصفنا أشدّ اختلافا فإذا كبسته بأصابعك يغيب ثمّ يرجع وربما كان معه قرقرة ويعظم كثيرا عند دخول الحمّام والتعب الشديد، فإن كان من قبل الرطوبة فإنّه يكون ليّنا.
لا يغيب اذا كبسته بيدك ولا يزيد ولا ينقص، فإن كان من قبل الدم فإنّه مع هذه العلامات يظهر الورم الى السواد، فإن كان من قبل لحم نابت فيكون الورم جاسيا صلبا ويثبت على قدر واحد.
فإن كان من قبل الريح كان لمسه ليّنا، والعمل في ذلك أن تنظر فإن كان نتو السرّة من قبل دم الشريان أو الوريد أو الريح فينبغى أن تمتنع من علاجه فإنّ في ذلك خوفا وغررا كما أعلمتك في الباب الذي ذكرت فيه الأورام التي تحدث من قبل الشريان والوريد.
فإن كان نتو السرّة من قبل المعاء أو الثرب فينبغى أن تأمر العليل بأن يمسك نفسه ويقف واقفا ممتدّا ثمّ تعلّم بالمداد حول السرّة كلّها. Then you order him to lie between your legs on his back. Then you incise with a broad forceps around the anus at the place you marked with ink. Then you elevate the center of the tumor upwards with a large clamp. Then you tie the incision site with a strong thread or use tied silk tightly.
Then make the tie firm. Next, open the tightened center of the tumor above the tie and insert your third finger. Demand the intestine. If you find that the tie has grasped it, relax the firmness and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find a hernia, dilate it with a clamp.
Then cut it. If a vein or artery obstructs you, incise it properly and return to your work. Take two needles and insert two strong threads into them. Insert the needles into the incision you made around the tumor, tightening them as you pull them through. Then tighten the tumor in four places with the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the site until the tightened flesh rots and falls off by itself, or cut it if it becomes soft and rotten. Then treat it with ointments as necessary until it heals. If the hemorrhoid is from necrotic flesh, let it be.
Or if it is due to moisture, you should excise the tumor as we said, and remove the blood or moisture you find. Then treat it with ointments that will heal the site.
The Fifty-third Chapter.
On the Treatment of Cancer.
We have mentioned in the division the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines, warning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate. We have also mentioned the cancer generated in the womb and warned against treating it.
And the ancients have noted that when cancer is in a place that can be completely excised, as is the case with cancer in the breast or in the thigh and similar organs, it is especially advisable to do so, particularly if it is newly appeared and small. Otherwise, if it has progressed and become large, it should not be approached.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, and I have not seen anyone before me reach that. When the work is in a place that is accessible as we said, you should proceed with the black soup first, making the diseased part pass through several doses. Then, if it is in the veins, separate it by evident filling.
Then place the diseased area in a position suitable for treatment. Insert the appropriate cantharides tubes into the cancer, then cauterize it from all sides along with the skin, thoroughly examining until nothing of its root remains. Allow the blood to flow without cutting it off quickly.
But squeeze the areas and let all the thick blood flow out by hand or with whatever tool you can use. If during the procedure you encounter a great bleeding from a cut vein or artery, ligate the vessel until the blood stops flowing, then continue treatment with other remedies until it heals.
The Fourth and Fifty-First Chapter.
In the Treatment of Hernia.
We have been informed about the classification of lithiasis and how water assembly occurs in each type, along with its signs and treatment with medicines. Only the uric type is treated with iron; neither the bladder type nor the fleshly type at all.
If that is the case, this is a fight. If you have treated this uric stone type with medicines and your treatment has not been effective, then look whether the patient has过度了其虚弱，或者在他身上有其他疾病，比如他可能有其他的病。请注意，翻译已终止在合理英文表达处，保持原文意思完整。
If it is cough or diarrhea, beware of treating it with iron; for that is a risk. If you see the patient strong and not suffering from any other disease except stone alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the course of action is to establish the patient in a standing position before you. And a servant stands behind him and squeezes his abdomen with his hands, pushing the water downward to the region of the pubis. Then a shock electrode is taken in this manner:
Limited on both sides, long and defined at the ends like a forceps, except that it has a small amount of corrosion to prevent it from being considered valid for use with the intestine. Then look whether the formation of stone is from the intestinal side.
It is necessary to separate with the incision from the anus a distance of three fingers below, above the pubis. If the formation of stone is from liver disease, make your incision on the left side of the anus by three fingers. If its formation is from spleen disease, make your incision on the right side by three fingers.
Also, the incision must not be made on the side where the patient intends to lie, lest fluid flow to that weak place, then pierce the skin entirely with the instrument and insert it into that incision while you raise your hand.
With the forceps between the skin and the membrane, as if you were peeling it, make the amount you peel off about the size of a fingernail or so. Then pierce the membrane until the forceps reach an empty place which is where the water is. Remove the forceps and insert into the hole the instrument which this is its image.
And it is similar to a tube made of a thin pipe, crafted from silver or copper or from smooth and polished steel, having at its bottom a small hole, and on its sides three holes; two on one side and one on the other as you can see.
And it may be placed with its tip on the liver in the shape of a pen. Here is its image:
At its upper tip, there is a ring. If the instrument reaches the water, it will descend from the ring onto the instrument. It will empty a medium amount of water at the right time, for if you empty more than what is appropriate at the wrong time, the patient might die due to the dissolution of his vital spirit.
Or it is covered with a cloth close to death, but it should be emptied according to its strength and what the condition of the patient indicates, such as the strength of his pulse and the goodness of his color. Then remove the instrument and retain the water, for it will be retained in the ring.
Because of the skin that holds the hole in the membrane, as I have instructed you to plug it in that manner, then replace the instrument another day if you see the patient capable of enduring that.
And also take out a small amount of the water and do that for several days while on your back, and guard against error until there is but a small amount of water left. If you fear for the patient and leave something of the water much behind, then treat it by burying it in hot sand.
And let him sweat much in the bath and sun, and restrain him from thirst and treat him with dried medicines until he recovers. Let him boil on the stomach, liver, and spleen after the water is extracted as described before.
Fifth and Fifty-fifth Chapter.
In the treatment of children who are born with urethral prongs or where the hole is narrow or in an improper position.
Some boys may be born with their urethra unperforated. It should therefore be punctured immediately upon birth.
With a very fine probe as shown in this figure:.
Then place a thin lead nail in the hole and bind it. Hold it for three or four days. When urine desires, remove the nail by tilting it, then replace it. If you do not use lead, the urine may pass to the correct location without closing up.
And if the hole is narrow, it should be treated with lead as we have said, keeping it for many days until it widens. For those in whom the hole is in an improper position, some are born with the hole at the end of the prepuce, so they cannot urinate forward.
Until he raises the rectum with his hand above and prevents it before the urine cannot reach the womb on a straight path, which is a very ugly cause, and the work in this regard is that the patient should lie on his back.
Then extend it with your left hand strongly and shave the head of the urethra with a razor or a sharp forceps as if you were carving something, making its middle part indented like a dimple, and let the hole be in the middle as it should be.
And be cautious in your work to prevent bleeding, for it often occurs. Address it by cutting off the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
The Sixth and Fifty-First Chapter.
In the fistula that occurs in the groove, dimple, and blackened area, and the adhesion of the groove to the dimple.
This fistula often occurs in the urethra, which is a fold of fatty tissue. It may be恶化的 and non-malignant. The non-malignant one should be treated by suturing with a fine needle.
And cut it until you remove all of it, then apply a cotton soaked in the Egyptian ointment, and treat it afterward with the palm-oil ointment until it heals. If the fistula is恶化的 and of a dusky color, it should be cauterized after cutting and draining it.
If the fistula is in a groove of an uncircumcised patient and some part of it is inside the groove and some part outside, it should be extracted from the inside first. When it has healed, then treat it from the outside.
Because when you treat them together, there is no assurance that the swelling will not rupture. Also, blackening and decay may occur in females and in the swelling; it should be incised of all that has turned black and might decay or has already decayed.
Then apply honey after that with the ground and sifted rind of the date palm and cardoon. Then treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped iron on this pattern:.
If cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, namely bleeding and a wound that has decayed, if the swelling resolves completely at some point, it should be noted that a tube of lead should be inserted to allow the remedy to be applied on it. As for the adhesion of the swelling to the core.
This adhesion occurs in those whose swelling is healthy and has not required circumcision. It may also adhere due to a wound or tumor; it should be removed with forceps until the bond dissolves and the core is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them by probing, a small part should be removed from the core and the swelling. This is because the swelling is thin; it might rupture quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the swelling from the core with a thin cotton cloth moistened in cold water to prevent adhesion as well.
Then treat with astringent decoction until it heals.
The Seventh and Fifty-First Chapter.
In the Purification of Boys and Treatment of What Affects Them Due to Error
Circumcision is nothing but the separation of what is joined, like other surgeries. Although it is something we do by our will and use especially for boys, it is necessary to outline the best practice for it.
And the easiest way to safety, I say that the early ones did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their religions. It is only what we acquired.
By experimentation, I found that the majority of craftsmen and barbers use purification with mousia and scissors. They also use ligature with a thread and cut with the fingernail. I have tried all these methods.
I found that the best method is purification with scissors and ligature with a thread because purification with mousia often causes the skin to contract, as the skin of the foreskin has two layers; it may cut the upper layer while leaving the lower layer intact.
He will have to make another cut, causing additional pain, and purification with a flicca does not ensure the cutting of the tip of the prepuce, as it may enter its hole. As for purification with the fingernail, the skin might slip off, ruining your work or the boy's foreskin might be naturally short.
For they are often born that way and do not require purification, as I have seen. As for purification with scissors and ligature with a thread, experimentation revealed its superiority because the scissors are suitable for cutting, as the upper blade is like the lower blade.
When you suture the hand with the two blades in harmony, cut to a uniform length and at one time, let the thread's grip become almost like a wall of the scrotum from all aspects, so there is no possible mistake. The purpose of the work first is to deceive the boy.
And especially if he understands somewhat that you are tying the thread only in his scrotum and leaving it for another day, then please him and delight him in every way you can do so and what he can accept with his mind, then keep him before you erect.
And let him not be sitting, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so that his eye does not fall upon them at all, nor on anything from the instruments. Then insert your hand into his scrotum and blow into the skin and raise it up until the head of the scrotum comes out.
Then cleanse the area of any dirt or filth. Then tie the indicated place with a doubled thread. Then tie a little below it with a second knot. Hold firmly with your thumb and index finger the spot where you made the lower knot, and cut between the two knots. Then raise the skin above quickly and extract the head of the scrotum. Then let the blood flow a little, for this is better and less likely to cause swelling in the scrotum. Then wipe it with a wet cloth. Then sprinkle it with dry burned pumpkin ashes; this is the best I have tried. Or use fine charcoal dust; this is also superior.
Then raise the skin above quickly and extract the head of the scrotum. Then let the blood flow a little, for this is better and less likely to cause swelling in the scrotum. Then wipe it with a wet cloth. Then sprinkle it with dry burned pumpkin ashes; this is the best I have tried. Or use fine charcoal dust; this is also superior. Then apply the yolks from above on a cloth dipped in rosewater beaten with fragrant fresh rose oil, and leave it on until another day. Then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
This is a picture of the scissors which are suitable for cleansing.
The scissors should be sharp and straight, with the points fitting tightly. The lengths of the blades should be equal to the length of the handles, both being equal. As for the mistake in cleansing, sometimes all or part of the skin may turn inside out during cutting. Therefore, it should be stretched from your wrist with your nail before the area swells.
And cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your nail, use forceps to cut it. If it has passed three days and the area below the heel remains swollen and warm, leave it until the hot swelling subsides, then remove it gently.
And cut it as you see fit, but be careful around the tip of the penis. If you cut anything from the tip of the penis, it will not harm; treat it with a skin graft as described in our article on skin grafts.
And if you cut more skin than necessary and it contracts beyond the proper amount, that will not be greatly harmful either. Treat it as we have described until it heals.
The eighth and fifty-third section.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to obstruction from a stone, clotted blood, pus, or prolapsed flesh, and so on. If you treat this as described, using the methods outlined in分类，请归入其中。
And if the urine does not pass and you see that the retention is due to a stone damaging the neck of the bladder, it should be placed on his knees in a reclining position. Then, a foot should be placed on his back while he extends his belly towards his back. He should hold himself as much as possible.
When the neck of the bladder is forced to push the stone back, urine will be released. If it does not release with what we mentioned and the matter presses on the patient, it should be extracted using the instrument called catheter as shown in this figure:.
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, and hollow like a bird's feather tube. It is about a span and a half in length. Its head has a gentle bend. To draw urine with it, take a curved thread and tie cotton or gauze securely at its end.
You insert the end of the thread into the tip of the catheter and clamp any excess cotton with forceps. If it falls into the tube, seal it with a stopper. Then, coat the catheter with oil or butter or egg white. Place the patient on a chair.
You urinate the bladder and urethra with wet fingers or oil and warm water, then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra. Then bend the urethra upwards towards the anus, and push the catheter inside.
Until it is bent, you push the catheter inside until it reaches close to the prostate. Then, you tilt the penis downwards and insert the catheter into it. Push it further until it reaches the bladder. The patient will feel that he has reached a void space.
And this is done in this sequence because the passage through which urine flows has a bend. Then, you stretch the thread with a little force by tying it with cotton. As a result, the urine follows the cotton. You then remove it, and the urine flows out. You repeat the use of the catheter.

The Fifty-ninth Chapter.
How to Inject the Bladder with Zarqa'.
And the images of the instruments that are suitable for this purpose are made from silver or from hollow ivory with a long管窥者止于此，译为：And the images of the instruments that are suitable for this purpose are made from silver or from hollow ivory with a long tube.
It is made from silver or from hollow ivory with a long tube. It is flexible except for the tip, which is closed. There are three holes in it: two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
And the hollow place that contains the suction is made to fit what it blocks without any excess. So, when you draw it towards something of the moisture, it is drawn in, and when you push it away, it moves out a distance, much like the device used to shoot oil with naptha in naval battles.
And if you wish to apply the moisture to the bladder, you insert the tip of the zarqa' into the moisture and draw it upwards with the pump. The moisture will be drawn into the hollow of the zarqa', then its tip is inserted into the urethra as described in the catheters, and then the moisture is pushed out with the pump.
And that moisture will reach the bladder, and the patient will feel it. This is also a gentle syringe used for injecting the bladder.
It is made of silver or sparduine, its upper part resembling a small funnel, and below it there is a cut in which the ligament is placed. Then take a camel's bladder and put in it the moisture you wish to inject into the bladder, then tie it tightly between the two cuts with a doubled thread.
Warm that moisture slightly on the fire, then insert the end of the injector into the urethra. Tighten your hand on the bladder with the moisture tightly enough for the patient to feel that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If a bladder is not available, take a piece of leather and make it into a circle, piercing it all around. Then insert a tight thread through those holes as you would for a pouch. After placing what you want—moisture, unguents, or water—in it, gather the circle together as you would a purse.
Then tie it in the machine and manipulate it as you did with the bladder by squeezing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
In the Extraction of Stones.
We have mentioned the classification of stones and their treatment with medicines. We have also noted the difference between a stone generated in the kidney and one generated in the bladder, along with the signs and symptoms of each. Additionally, we have discussed the stone for which manual intervention and incision are required.
And it is the stone generated in the bladder, especially that which develops in the urethra. I will describe this in detail and briefly.
I say that the stone formed in the bladder is more likely to affect boys, and one of its signs is that urine comes out of the bladder resembling water in its thinness.
Sand is visible in it, and it irritates the penis, playing with it, and often hanging down then spreading, and the prepuce becomes prominent in many of them. It is easy for boys to recover from it until they reach fourteen years, but it is more difficult in old men. As for young men, it is intermediate between the two.
And that which has a larger stone is easier to treat, while smaller stones are the opposite. When we move to treatment, it should first be that the fluid is instilled with an injection to expel all the sediment within it; for it may prevent the presence of the stone during examination.
Then, the fluid is taken with his legs and shaken downwards to cause the stone to descend into the bladder neck or to drop from a high position several times. Then, he is placed facing you with his legs hanging down, and his hands under his thighs so that the entire bladder tilts downward. Afterwards, it should be examined.
And examine it externally. If you feel the stone in the space, act quickly with your fingers to split it open. If it does not fall under your touch at all, it should be smeared with oil on the little finger if the patient is a boy, or with the middle finger.
If it is a complete boy, insert your hand into his prepuce and examine for the stone. When it falls under your finger, move it little by little to the bladder neck, then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the place you wish to incise.
And command a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand and command another servant that he extend his right hand above towards the labia and with his other hand extend the skin beneath the labia away from the place where the incision will be, then take the forceps here is its shape.
And incise between the vulva and the labia not in the middle but beside the left labium. The incision should be of the same size as a grain of barley, with your finger inside the vulva while pressing it outward, curled so that the opening is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside to the extent that the grain of barley can pass through.
It should not be larger, for perhaps the finger inside the vulva will press the stone at the time of incision, causing it to pass out without difficulty. Know that some stones may have corners or letters, making their passage difficult due to this.
And some are smooth like acorns and rolled, making their passage easy. If it has corners or letters, increase the incision slightly. If it does not pass this way, it is best to grasp it with a clamp whose tip is like a probe.
And hold it with the clamp so that it does not escape. Alternatively, insert a thin curved instrument beneath it. If you cannot manage this, increase the incision slightly. If bleeding occurs and prevails, stop it with cauterization.
And if there are more than one, first push the largest into the bladder, then incise it, and afterward push the smaller one. Do this similarly if there are more than two. If it is extremely large, it is不明智去尝试对其施行一个极大的切口，因为这会使病人面临两种风险。
Either he dies or it happens that there is continuous dribbling of urine, for the place will not adhere at all. But try to push it until it comes out or break it with forceps until you cut it out completely.
When you have finished your work, dress the wound with a sponge and bind it tightly with bandages, stretching and tying it. Make a hole above it soaked in oil and drink or ointment and rosewater to cool the hot swelling. Then let the patient lie on his side. Do not apply the bandage until the third day.
When it has healed, wash the area with much water and oil. Then treat it with the nux vomica ointment and the basilicon ointment until it is cured. If there is a lesion in the wound and a hot swelling that increases, and similar conditions such as when blood freezes in the bladder and urine is obstructed, and this can be recognized by the discharge of blood with the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it may lead to corruption of the bladder and its infection. Then wash the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and treat each type with what resembles it in treatment until it is cured.
It is necessary at all times during treatment to bind the thighs together to hold the medicines applied to the area. If the stone is small and has entered the urinary tract, becoming embedded and obstructing urine flow, treat it with what I am describing before it reaches a severe stage.
Often, I have been able to use this treatment instead of making an incision. This is how you should take a wire made of ironware:
Triangle of the end sharp inserted in a stick, then take a thread and tie it under the stone so as not to return to the bladder. Then enter a forceps with care into the urethra until the forceps reaches the same stone.
Turn the forceps with your hand slightly in the same stone and aim for its hole until you pass it from the other side. Then clamp your hand on what remains of the stone outside the penis; it will break and come out with the urine, and the disease will be cured.
If this treatment is not available to you due to some obstruction, tie a thread under the stone and another above the stone. Then incise the stone in the same penis between the two ties, and remove it.
Then untie the thread and clean the congealed blood that has remained in the wound. It was necessary to tie the thread under the stone so as not to return to the bladder, and the other thread above so that when the thread is untied after the stone is removed, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should raise the skin above so that it returns to its place when you are finished and covers the wound as we have said.
The Sixty-First Section.
On the Removal of Stones in Women.
Stones are rarely found in women. If a stone does develop in one of them, its treatment is difficult and often impossible due to several reasons. One reason is that the woman might be a virgin, and another is that you might not find a woman willing to allow a physician to examine her.
If she is a virgin or one of those with close kinship, and you do not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially by hand, and fourthly, since the place for making an incision for stone in women is far from the actual location of the stone, it requires a deep cut.
If there is danger in this, and necessity demands it, you should take a skilled female physician. Such women are rare, so if unavailable, seek a virtuous and gentle male physician or prepare a skilled midwife who is well-versed in matters of women. Alternatively, get a woman who can make some indication in this craft.
Prepare her and command her to perform all that you instruct her to do in examining the stone. This is that she should examine whether the woman is a virgin, for it should be that she insert her finger into the woman's vagina and feel for the stone. If she finds it and presses on it with her finger, it will give indication of its presence.
Then command her to make the incision, provided she is not a virgin but a woman of experience. Instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and feel for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
Then, if she finds it, she should introduce it from the bladder's opening downward until she reaches the base of the thigh. There, make an incision on the side of the vagina at the base of the thigh where the stone is felt.
And her finger should not be removed from the stone, pressed beneath it. Let the incision initially be small. Then introduce a probe into this small incision. If she feels the stone, widen the incision according to what she knows is necessary for the stone to pass through. Know that types of stones are numerous.
From the small and large, smooth and rough, long and short, corkscrew-shaped and those with branches; know their kinds so that you may rely on this for what you need. If the blood overcomes you, dust it in the sticky powdered area and hold it for a while until the blood ceases, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out, work that you may count upon among the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men to assist you in your task. If bleeding overcomes you and you know by the pulse of the blood that it is from a severed artery, place the dust on the area.
Strengthen it with ligatures tightly and leave it without redoing it. Do not remove the stone; perhaps the patient will be harmed. Then treat the wound. If the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area heals, return to your work until you remove the stone.
The Second Section, Sixty.
In the切分应为：“在切开治疗水疝。”
Water hernia is nothing but the accumulation of moisture in the scrotal sac which is below the skin surrounding the testicle. It may have a special membrane prepared by nature in one part of the testicle.
Until it is thought to be another testicle. It occurs between the scrotal skin and the scrotal sac we mentioned, and this does not happen except in rare cases. This water hernia arises from a weakness that affects women, so this material suspends itself due to exposure to a blow on the women's parts.
This moisture has many colors: it may be yellow, or blood-red, or pitch-black, or watery white, and is most frequently of the latter type, and by these signs it is known.
Where water is present, if it is in the white scapha as we have said, the swelling will be elongated slightly like an egg shape, and the testicle does not become apparent because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in a special sac, the swelling will be round on one side of the egg shape.
And that is why a person may think it is another egg. If the moisture is between the scrotal skin and the white scapha, it is felt by touch. As for knowing the color of the moisture, you should press the swelling with the square probe shown in its image, and whatever comes out in the wake of the probe, judge what is inside by its appearance.
And when we come to treatment with iron, it should be ordered for the patient to undergo cautery if possible and you see his body filled [with moisture]. Then he should lie on his back on something slightly elevated. Place many wounds under him, then sit at his left side.
And you should order a servant to sit on his right side, stretching his penis to one side of the scrotal skin and towards the area of the groin. Then take a broad forceps and incise the scrotal skin from the middle lengthwise close to the pubis.
And the incision should be straight and parallel to the line that divides the scrotal skin into two halves, until it reaches the white scapha. Splay this and ensure you do not cut it. Your separation should be more on the side that adheres to the egg shape, and you should separate it as much as possible.
Then inflate the filled sac gradually and thoroughly, extracting all the water. Next,分开伤口的双唇用镊子，将囊袋向上牵引，不要接触包含阴囊皮肤，并尽可能完整地或逐段切断囊袋。
And especially its delicate side, for if you do not ensure its complete cutting, there is a risk of water returning. If the egg protrudes outside its skin while you are working, once you have finished cutting the sac, reduce it back inside, then suture the foreskin lips together.
Then treat it as other surgeries until it heals. If you have affected the egg, it has gone bad from another illness; therefore, you should tie the vessels in the scrotum to prevent bleeding, then cut the sperm duct from the scrotum and remove the egg, then treat it as we have mentioned.
If the water has collected in both sides equally, know that they are two adreteries. Split the other side in the same manner as you did for the first. If you prefer to do the work uniformly on both sides, do so, then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions cotton that you have soaked in oil or rose fat. From outside, place another piece of cotton that you have soaked in a mixture of drink and oil over the testicles and the inguinal region. Place a folded patch above the opening; this is the ravfah. And tie it from above with the ligature which has six ends as shown.
Then take two patches, suture and stuff them with fluffy cotton as shown. Make the ends that you fold with wet cotton or damp wool, and gather by pulling with a belt around the waist. One end should be attached to the backrest to reach the back.
The second is to take up to the groin and both ends on the thighs from below, and the remaining two ends on the hips. You gather all the tension in the waistband of the trousers. This girdle can also be made by ironing instead of cutting with iron.
And you take a fine surgical iron and cut the skin of the scrotum with it while it is swollen as we described until the white sac containing the water is revealed. Place another iron on this shape.
And it resembles the Greek eye. Then you apply pressure to that sac while it is swollen until all the moisture comes out. Next, you stretch the sac with clamps and peel off the containing layer with an iron. Cut it as much as you can until you remove all of it and preserve the egg so that it does not come into contact with fire.
And know that this work is safer and farther from bleeding and better than cutting. If you encounter in the region of cutting or during ironing a hot swelling, bleeding, or anything else, you should treat it as appropriate with the treatment suitable for each case as previously mentioned.
And if the patient is timid and cannot endure this work due to its severity, let him use a wet cloth as I have described. If it works for you as we have explained with our evidence.
And know that the girdle is watery. Therefore, seat the patient on a high chair. Apply pressure to the swelling from below with a broad forceps. Place the wet cloth along the length of the body, making the opening wide enough so that all the water drains out. Then place a cloth over the area and tie it.
Leave it to drain the rest of the water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not leave out in time when you cauterize it, this is due to the white membrane obstructing the mouth of the wound and preventing the water from leaving.
Then it should be necessary to insert a goose feather or the instrument used to extract the water of lovers, which is depicted in the preceding illustration, or slightly enlarge the opening of the wound.
And know that the water may return and collect after six months or so. If it does collect, cauterize it in the same manner and let the disease run its course for several days.
The Third and Sixty-Third Chapter.
On Making Incisions in the Fleshy Ligaments and Their Treatment.
Know that making incisions in these fleshy ligaments is fraught with danger, leading to death in most cases. Therefore, we see it best to avoid them and remain safe. I will, however, remember the procedure and various swellings associated with them.
I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies where the composition of the female organs is present, and this can be due to various causes: either from a hot secretion flowing into the female organs or from a blow. The color of the swelling is similar to that of the body, and it does not contain any water.
The swelling may be sore. Sometimes, the swelling becomes hard, its color like that of mud, and it has no sensation. It may also be due to the complication and swelling of the arteries, as mentioned before, or from the swelling of the veins. If the swelling is due to the swelling of the arteries, this can be recognized by the dispersion of the swelling.
If you compress it with your fingers, there should be nothing to worry about. As for what is caused by the swelling of veins, nothing disappears when compressed with fingers. This kind may cause trouble for it and for all other flesh.
And this is to incise the scrotal skin, then elevate the testis upwards and remove it through the white septum, and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from all sides of the testis, if the testis has adhered to the newly grown flesh.
It is necessary to remove and cut the testis, if there is adhesion between any of the septa or among the vessels. In such cases, all such adhesions should be freed and cut in a circular manner.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is from behind, it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the testis as we said. When you have completed your work, dress the wound with wet cotton soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
The Fourth and Sixty Chapter.
In the treatment of varicocele with hydrocele.
Daliah is a hernia-like swelling curved due to some curvature, resembling a bunch of grapes with relaxation of the scrotum and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking. In treating this condition, there is a similar risk involved as what was previously mentioned.
But it is necessary to mention the procedure as the predecessors did. I say that the patient should sit on a high chair, then push the spermatic cords downwards. Then hold the scrotal skin with your fingers along with the vessels which are close to the penis.
He holds it for you while stretching it strongly, then incise with a broad sharp forceps along the course of the vessels until the vessels become visible. Then peel it off from every side as you were told about stripping the arteries in the palms. Finally, insert a needle with a doubled thread into it.
It is tied at the first place where the daliah was shown to you, and also at the end. Then it is incised in the middle with a vertical incision along the length of the body, and the impure corrupted humors collected in it are removed.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other surgeries you wish to delay until the vessels that nourish one of the ovaries drop off. There is no harm in this. If the daliah affects all the vessels, it should be removed along with one of the ovaries to prevent the egg from lacking nutrition. From before cutting the vessels, it withers and is no longer of use.
The Fifth and Sixty-sixth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Intestinal Abscesses.
The occurrence of this abscess results from a tear that exposes the omental membrane extending over the abdomen near the ovaries. The intestine then protrudes through that hernia into one of the ovaries.
This hernia can occur either from a tear in the omental membrane or from its extension. These two types are among many causes, which may include a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting something heavy and so on. Its sign is that it happens gradually over a long period of time if it is due to the extension of the omental membrane.
No swelling occurs suddenly and is level to the depth before the canal compresses the intestine, and its sign is that if it is from the tearing of the canal it happens from its beginning with great pain at once and the swelling is visible under the skin in the vicinity.
This occurs with the expulsion of the intestine and its exit from the canal to the outside. It may also come out with the feces, in which case it is called a mezzy disease both from the intestines and from the pus. It may also be accompanied by foul odor, and the impure material may flow into the intestine and get stuck there, causing the death of the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and cramping, especially if compressed, and the treatment of these types of ailments with iron is dangerous and should be avoided. The procedure to follow is to order the patient to push the intestine back into the abdomen with his hand if it can be returned.
Then he lies on his elbows in front of you and raises his legs. You stretch the skin below the iliac region upwards, then incise all the scrotal skin lengthwise. Next, you insert clips into the edges of the incision to the extent needed for the incision to remain open.
The incision should be of such a size that the egg can be removed through it. Then, you should separate the scrotal sacs beneath the scrotal skin until the white, hard canal is exposed from all sides. At this point, insert your third finger beside the egg.
Between the white canal beneath the egg's skin and the second canal, insert your index finger to release the adhesion from behind the egg. Then, using your right hand, fold it inward towards the scrotal skin. At the same time, with your left hand, stretch the white canal upwards. Raise the egg along with the canal towards the incision.
You command the servant to extend the egg towards the top and you release the adhesion from behind with a complete release and you examine with your finger lest there be anything of the twisted intestine in the hard white shell; if you hit anything, push it towards the belly bottom.
Then you take a needle with a thick thread spun from ten strands and insert it at the end of the shell beneath the skin behind the cut. Then you cut off the ends of the thread so that four strands remain. Then you interlace them together in a firm manner and tie the shell that we said is beneath the scrotal skin tightly with ties from both sides. Then you also wind the ends of the threads tightly and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels they supply can reach them. Lest it become a hot swelling, you also make a second tie outside the first tie, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two ties, you leave the shell beneath the scrotal skin the length of an finger bone.
Lest it become a hot swelling, you also make a second tie outside the first tie, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two ties, you leave the shell beneath the scrotal skin the length of an finger bone. You cut the rest in a circular manner and remove the egg with it, then you make a cut in the scrotal skin below, causing blood to flow as described earlier. Then, cotton soaked in oil is used and placed in the wound, and the tie described is used.
And the white shell, which we said to cut carefully to prevent bleeding, is often prone to it. You leave the tie until it falls off by itself; if it falls slowly, you may apply hot water to it and apply something to irritate it until it falls.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of all wounds until it heals.
The Sixth and Sixty-First Chapter.
In the pulmonary abscess, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. As for the early ones, they should be treated as we described in the abscess with a boil. This is by ligating the vessels after incising them gently below.
Then incise in the middle and treat the swelling with what opens it until the vessels drop out, and treat the wound as we have mentioned until it heals.
The Seventh and Sixty-First Chapter.
In the hernia that occurs in the groin.
Hernia may occur in the groin as we have said, protruding the area without anything of the intestine descending into the scrotum. If any does descend, it is only a little and reverts at all times.
But if time prolongs, the incision in the scrotum increases until the intestine descends and the hernia appears due to the extension of the scrotal part as we have said. This is because the scrotum extends, then relaxes and returns to its place, protruding. Its treatment is by cauterization as described earlier.
It can be treated with iron in this manner: The patient lies on his back before you, then incise the area of the warm hernia extending the incision about three fingers' width, and dilate the vessels beneath the skin.
Until the white cranium beneath is revealed, you take some flannel and place it over the natural opening in the cranium and press it to the depth of the abdomen. Then you suture the two natural openings with the edge of the flannel from the cranium and secure one by stitching it to the other.
Then you draw out the edge of the flannel and do not cut the cranium at all, nor touch the egg or anything else as I have instructed you in treating intestinal hernias. Then treat it according to the methods for wounds.
When the sutures become detached, cleanse them and treat the wound until it heals. The cranium will contract and the hernia will not worsen.
And the cautery is better in this case because it is closer to ensuring safety.
The Eighth and Sixty-First Chapter.
On the relaxation of the scrotal skin.
Often, the scrotal skin relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, making its appearance unpleasant. Therefore, for those who wish to treat this condition, the patient should be laid on their back.
And all the relaxed skin is cut away from the thick skin. Then join the lips, and if you wish, first suture the relaxed skin flap with three or four sutures and strengthen the suturing. Then cut between the sutures.
Then treat it according to the methods for other wounds until it heals and the sutures fall out.
Chapter Fifty-Nine
In the Male Genital Examination.
In our law, male genital examination is forbidden.
And for this reason, it is incumbent upon me not to mention it in my book. I have only mentioned it for two reasons: the first, so that it may be known to the physician if he is asked about it and so that he may know the treatment of those affected by it; the second, as we often need to examine some animals for our benefit.
As for animals such as camels, sheep, cats, and the like, I say that male genital examination occurs in two ways: either by pressing or by cutting and removing. The one done by pressing involves sitting the animal in hot water until its penis relaxes, becomes soft, and droops.
Then press it with your hand until it relaxes and does not become apparent upon touch. As for the examination by cutting and removing, you should hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its penis with your left hand, then tie the ligaments and make a single incision on each testicle.
Until the two testicles become visible, cut them after剥离它们，确保不要留下任何血管外的精索，除了附在血管上的薄精索。这种切开的方式比通过按压更为优。
Because pressing might leave something in the penis, and the animal might desire copulation. Therefore, treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the Treatment of Intersex Conditions.
The intersex condition in men occurs in two types. One of them is that it appears as a space or on the skin between the scrotum and the anus, resembling a woman's vagina with hair, and urine may flow from what is on the scrotal skin.
As for women, there is one type, which appears above the vagina on the labia, resembling small penises of men that protrude from one of them like a male penis, and both are similar to the female ones. The treatment of the three types is as follows.
For the two types in men and the single type in women, it is necessary to cut the excess flesh until its trace is removed, then treat it with the treatment of other surgeries until it heals. As for the second type in men, which discharges urine from what is on the scrotal skin, there is no need for any operation or cure at all.
The Seventy-First Chapter.
On the Cutting of the Clitoris and the Tissue Protruding from Women's Vulvas.
The clitoris may sometimes become larger than the normal size, causing it to swell and disfigure its appearance. In some women, it may enlarge to resemble that in men, making it suitable for intercourse.
It is necessary to hold the excess of the clitoris with your hand or forceps and cut it, but do not过度切割，以免引起出血。
Then treat it with the treatment of surgeries until it heals. As for the protruding flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb to fill it.
It may sometimes come out outside like the tail. Therefore, some of the early physicians call this condition a tail abscess, and it should be cut as you would cut a balanos abscess, and it should be treated until it heals.
The Seventy-Second Chapter.
In the Treatment of Dropsy.
Dropsy is when the woman's vagina is not perforated or has a small hole, which can either be congenital or acquired. The acquired ones are due to some preceding illness and can be either from excess granulation tissue.
Or from thin or thick exudate, which can be in the depth of the uterus, on its sides, at its upper part, or lower part, and it prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth; it might also prevent menstruation. This can be determined by the midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is visible and close, but if it is not visible, probe with her fingers or a gauze. If the obstruction is from thin exudate and close to the labia, puncture it promptly by making an incision similar to the lips, then place your thumbs on both sides.
The woman should lie on her back with her legs spread, then she should forcefully separate the labia until the thin exudate is punctured and the obstruction opens. Then she should take some wool, soak it in oil, and apply it to the area. The woman should have intercourse every day to prevent the area from adhering again.
If the sinus is thick and dense, it should be incised with a broad forceps resembling a date leaf. If the blockage is from new flesh, suspend it with forceps and cut it away; let there be with you medicines to quell bleeding without caustics such as caelia, shian, and balsam mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube lest the wound adhere quickly, hold it for days and use dry cotton wool. Then treat with other treatments for adhesion until it heals. And another mass of flesh may appear in the uterus, so it should be cut in this manner.
If it is not a malignant tumor, the malignant tumor in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
The Seventy-third Chapter.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red blisters that appear in women's genital areas.
As for hemorrhoids, they are the swelling of the openings of veins until much constant blood flows from them. When hemorrhoids become chronic, they turn into warts. I have mentioned in the classification their types, signs, and symptoms, and we will mention them here.
What can be treated and what cannot be treated, I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep in the uterus and not palpable, have no treatment with iron. Those from which there is palpation are the ones that can be treated.
It should be that the woman enter a cold room, then apply the warts with a pincette or a rough cloth, cut them off from their roots, and then sprinkle them when bleeding occurs from one of the clamps that stop the bleeding without cauterization.
Like caqia, shiyan, and laban, and similar substances. Then raise her legs to the wall for a while. Then lower them into cold water. If bleeding continues, seat her in a decoction of saffron, bark of bitter almond, and acacia gum. Take barley flour, mix it with honey and ferment.
Apply it to her back. If the bleeding stops, keep her in this position. Otherwise, use a splint for incision and mastoid areas without any exception. Then take wool and immerse it in juice of pomegranate peel or juice of pregnant tongue or juice of fig branches with acacia syrup. Keep it in place.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of haisha, rough to look at. It should be cut where it has appeared as described in the treatments for tumors, and treated until it heals.
The Fourth and Seventy-Fourth Chapter.
Regarding the retention of feces that may occur in the womb.
Various types of tumors may occur in the womb, such as cancer, hardened tumor, ulcers, hemorrhoids, ulcerator, corns, anal fissures, warts, and hot tumor. I have mentioned all these diseases, their types, and their symptoms in the classification.
It should be noted in this article that the hot tumor which may occur in the womb, if it is one of the tumors that have a prolonged course, how its hardness can be determined by iron. You should examine it; if the pain in the beginning of the tumor is sharp with pulsations, inflammation, and fever.
I have seen it red if sensation occurs, do not hasten to cut it but treat it with what helps maturity until these symptoms subside. Then it should be that the woman sits on a chair with two seats and supports herself on its back.
And she gathers her legs towards the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart. Her arms are placed under her knees and tied together with a band that is suitable.
Therefore, the midwife sits on the right side, and uses the instrument by which she opens the cervix of the uterus, the image of which will be shown later. If you wish to use this instrument, you should estimate the depth of the woman's uterus so that what enters from the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
It will harm the patient if the instrument exceeds the depth. In such a case, it should be that folds are placed on the cervix of the uterus to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus. It should also be that the tube within the instrument is from above.
And you hold the instrument, while the servant turns the tube until it opens the cervix of the uterus. If the discharge appears and can be touched by hand and is soft and yielding, you should cut it at its head with a broad forceps. Once all the fluid has been discharged.
It should be that a soft wick soaked in rose oil ointment or green olive oil with some grip is placed in the wound. The wick should protrude from the incision in the cervix. It should also be applied to the uterus and the perineum clean cotton soaked in boiling water with baker's yeast.
Then treat with the ointment suitable for this purpose for two days until it heals.
And the uterus and wound may be washed by injecting them with water and honey, then with boiled water in which the root of the datura or long thorn has been cooked. Then return to the ointment. If the abscess is hidden inside the uterus, it should be treated accordingly.
It is advisable to refrain from treating it with iron. It should be treated as we have mentioned in the division.
The Fifty-Seventh Chapter.
In Teaching the Surgeons How to Treat Living Fetuses That Have Been Delivered Abnormal.
The midwife should first know the normal pattern of birth. One of its signs is that you see the woman laboring downward and longing to breathe fresh air, and her postpartum condition becomes easier for her.
And to hasten the baby's delivery, know that this birth is on the natural pattern and its exit is with its head and the placenta either with it or hanging from its neck. If you see these signs, it should be pressed on her abdomen so that the baby comes out quickly.
For if it descends with its head, the placenta descends with it and should be cleaned properly. Any birth other than this is unnatural and condemned, as the baby may descend on its feet with its hands coming out before its head and feet.
And if it is one hand or one foot or he comes out with his head and one hand or he comes out folded, or perhaps he turns onto his back, and the like of these condemned shapes, it is advisable for the midwife to be skilled and delicate in all these matters and to beware of errors and mistakes.
I have explained each of them and how to apply the remedy for it so that you may rely on this and understand it, if the fetus comes out headfirst in a natural birth and great difficulty befalls the woman with the delivery and I see her strength has weakened, then I seat her on a chair and order women to attend to her.
She is then fomented with boiled horsemint and wet ointments, then the midwife inserts a small clamp between her fingers and either cuts the placenta with it or cuts it with her nail until the moisture within it flows out, and she squeezes the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be injected with the juice of horsemint mixed with ointment of the rectum. Then, after the injection, you should instruct her to sneeze and blow her nose with a condes (a type of tube or reed). Hold her mouth and nostrils; the fetus will come out from its cavity. If the hands of the fetus come out first, then you should gently return them little by little.
If they do not enter, place the woman on a stool and raise her legs above. Then shake the stool on the ground and the woman should hold herself to prevent falling during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus has died, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them gently; the fetus will come out. If the fetus comes out on its feet, then you should raise its feet and turn the fetus little by little until you straighten it, then take one of its feet and extend it slowly.
If they come out to the thighs, order her to strain and sniff with the condens. If it comes out in this way, then if it does not come out as described above and otherwise, gently return the fetus a little at a time until it is on the natural shape; then it will come out smoothly. If all of the above fails.
Take one part of the mucus of the ox hoove, one part of the mallow mucus, one part of the fat of the sheep's tail, and one part of dissolved gum. Pound all in a mortar well, then insert it into the woman's vagina and below her navel. Then seat her in cold water until it reaches the ovaries.
If you see that it has leaked below her, make her a pessary of mercury and she must bear it. When she holds the pessary for an hour, seat her on a chair, then sniff with her mouth and nose closed and gently squeeze her lower abdomen. The fetus will come out from its position, coming out with its knees and hands first.
If it comes out in this manner, have her slowly insert her hands further. Then, let the woman lie on her back and dangle her legs downward while lying on a bed, and keep her hands together. Gently squeeze above her abdomen a little at a time. Then, remove what is under her feet from the pillows so that she is tilted downward. If the fetus does not come out, take both her legs and move them strongly. Gently squeeze above the ovaries a little at a time until the fetus ascends upward. Then, let the midwife insert her hand and gently adjust the position of the fetus.
And the woman must be delivered until the fetus is born, with the fetus emerging with its back turned and one of its hands hanging down. If she can manage to push it back in, then let the woman remain in that position. If she cannot do so, cause her to sit up and make her walk. If she cannot walk, then have her lie down.
Place her on a bed and shake her thighs vigorously. Then apply the spoon described from the salivas. If she has a miscarriage, seat her in a chair and proceed to manage the return of the hand and the alignment of the fetus in its natural position. Instill medicine into the woman and order her to be delivered until the fetus is born.
The fetus should be born on its feet, with its hands extended and its face towards the back of the mother. The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then turn it little by little and align it gently. Once it is aligned, apply what we have described of the ointment and salivas to her breast.
Then make her move slightly. If she does so, seat her on a chair and order her to tilt towards the right side. Then make her be delivered and instill medicine into her nose with a condens. It will cause the fetus to be born standing on its side.
If it descends into the birth canal in this manner with the placenta, cut the placenta with your fingernail until it is free of moisture. If it is attached to the face or neck of the fetus, sever it at the umbilical cord to prevent the fetus from suffocating and dying. Then push the fetus inside until it is in the correct position.
And make the woman be delivered several times, for it comes out easily. The delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four may be born and live, though this is rare. As for five, it is something outside the natural order and they never live at all.
And they surround them, even if there are many from one fetus and they separate by a membrane barrier between each of them, fixed in the navel cord of each one. And they may be born as one newborn would be born naturally and easily, or they may be born as we described, disgracefully.
And if some of them experience difficulty at birth and become what we said of the unnatural shapes, adjust them as we described. Let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and delay, and adapt to each shape with whatever means are available to her that lead to safety.
What may be conceived in the womb are fetuses that may be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten. It has been reported to me that a woman gave birth to seven, and another to fifteen all of them formed.
By the estimation of the Most Merciful, All-Knowing, all this should be within the knowledge of the midwife, for it is possible that she may encounter such cases someday, and she should handle them as they require.
The Sixty-Seventh Chapter.
In the Extraction of the Dead Fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus as described in the division of treatment and it does not come out, and you are forced to use your hand, you should examine whether the woman is strong and free from symptoms that one fears might be harmed. If so, the woman should lie on a bed on her back.
And her head should be tilted downwards, and her legs raised. A servant should hold her on both sides or tie her to the bed to prevent her body from being pulled when the fetus is extended.
Then the mouth of its womb is moistened with wet fingers along with the saliva of the camel and acacia, and the sesame seed. Then the midwife anoints her hand with these substances. She then enters it into the womb gently, seeking a place to insert the forceps of the fetus, and the appropriate positions accordingly.
Look, if the fetus is presenting so that it can be delivered by forceps on its head, then insert the forceps into its eyes or its forehead or its mouth or its neck or under its chin or under its clavicles or in the nearby positions of the ribs or under the armpits.
And if it is to be delivered by its feet, then do so at the perineum and the middle ribs. It is best to hold the forceps with the right hand and direct them between the fingers of the left hand. Enter the hand gently and insert the forceps into one of those positions we have mentioned.
Until you reach something empty, then insert another forceps or a third one if needed to make the traction equal and not tilt towards any side. Then extend it evenly, but do not let the extension be only straight; move it in every direction.
It should be easy for it to come out, as is done with a tooth when extracting it. It is necessary between these steps that the extension be relaxed. If it gets stuck on any side, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from that side to turn what got stuck. If part of the fetus comes out, then move the forceps to other positions.
Raise it slightly. Do this until the fetus comes out completely. If a hand comes out first and cannot be pushed back due to compression, then wrap it with a cloth and pull it until it comes out completely, then cut it.
Either in the wrist or in the elbow, thus it should be done in the other hand and in the legs, if the head of the fetus is large and there is pressure on it during birth or if there is water collected in its head, you should introduce a spinal-like probe between the fingers.
And split it with it to allow the water to come out, or incise it with the instrument called mashdaakh which will be shown in the images of other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Similarly, if the fetus has a large head, you should split the skull or incise it with the mashdaakh as we said, then remove the bones with clamps. If the head comes out but gets compressed at the thoracic region, it should be split until the moisture in the chest drains out.
If the chest gets compressed then, if the chest does not decompress and it cannot be delivered, cut it open as much as you can. If it is low in the abdomen or has a swelling, you should incise it to allow the moisture to drain out.
If the fetus is in a breech position, then pulling it is easy and adjusting it to the birth canal is simple. If it gets compressed at the abdomen or chest, you should pull it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and split the abdomen or chest until the contents within drain out.
If all the other organs are extracted and only the head remains, and it has turned back, the midwife should use her left hand. If the birth canal is open, she should insert her hand into the cervical opening and reach for the head with it, pulling it with her fingers into the birth canal. Then she should insert forceps or two forceps and pull the head with them.
If the mouth of the womb has united with a hot tumor, it is not necessary to apply pressure on it; rather, it should be treated by applying wet and fatty substances, using compresses, and sitting in waters that relax and moisturize.
And if the fetus is on its side, if it can be turned, then what we have mentioned for a living fetus should be applied. If this cannot be done, then it should be cut and removed. It must not leave anything of the placenta inside at all. When you finish your treatment, apply what we have mentioned for the treatment of hot tumors that occur in the womb.
If there is a bleeding, she should immerse in contracting waters and apply all other treatments. I have seen a woman who became pregnant and the fetus died in her womb, then she became pregnant again.
Then the other fetus also died. It occurred to her after a long time as a tumor in her genital area, which swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. She was called upon for treatment, and I treated her for a long time. The wound did not heal, so I applied some of the strong suction ointments.
Then a bone came out from the place, and after days another bone came out. I was amazed at this, for the abdomen is not a place that has bones; I supposed it to be from the bones of the dead fetus. So I examined the wound and found many bones, including those from the head of the fetus.
I continued to follow this until I extracted many bones, and the woman was in her best condition. She lived like this for some time, exuding only a slight amount of pus from the place. I have mentioned here only this rarity.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the surgeon attempts to do with his hands in treatment.
Seventy-Seven Chapter.
It contains images of the instruments needed for extracting the fetus.
A picture of a catheter to open the cervix:.
This clamp that is used to equalize the books; it has two sticks with catheters at both ends. However, this catheter should be softer than the clamp and can either be made of rubber or wood. The width of each stick should be as thick as two fingers.
And let each be shaped like a finger, with their length being about a cubit and a half. In the middle of the sticks, there are two rods made of the same type of wood, tied to them; their length should be about half a cubit or a little more, and their width about two fingers or a little more.
They are the ones that are inserted into the cervix to open with them when you manipulate the catheters. A picture of another instrument for something similar, but softer and lighter:.
It is made from rubber or wood, shaped like forceps, except that it has two rods at its end as you can see. The length of each rod is about a cubit, and their width is about two fingers. If you wish to open the cervix with it.
Sit the woman on a sloping bed with her legs spread apart and apart between her thighs. Then, insert these two rods tightly into the cervix. You hold the bottom part of the instrument between her thighs. Next, open your hand with the instrument as you would with forceps, to the degree you desire for opening the cervix. Until the midwife accomplishes what she wants, the image of another ring, which the ancients mentioned, is depicted.
Image of the gun used to propel the fetus:
Image of the forceps used to grasp the baby's head:
The scissors have teeth at the tip as you can see. They can also be made rectangular like the clamps in this image, with teeth like a saw blade that cuts and smooths.
Image of the gun also:
Image of forceps:
This forceps has a slightly thick edge to prevent it from breaking when pulling on the baby, image of forceps with two teeth.
Image of broad forceps for cutting the baby:
All these instruments, the more their types are varied and prepared by the manufacturer, the faster they are to use and more valuable in people's estimation. Therefore, do not look down upon any instrument if it is prepared for you; there will inevitably be a need for it.
Chapter Seventy-Eight.
In the Extraction of the Placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, it should be instructed to hold herself. Then, induce her to sneeze using a condens (a device for inducing vomiting or sneezing). Hold her mouth and nostrils with your hand. If it comes out this way, good. Otherwise, try a little force.
Pierce a hole in the cover and place therein the opened herbs like foeniculum, satureja, thyme, borage, hyssop, safflower, and cantorie. All of these medicines or some of them should be immersed in water and heated over fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole of the pot lid and the other end in the cervix.
Hold it until the vapor reaches the bottom of the uterus. Then cough as we have said; the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, the midwife is ordered to immerse her left hand in scherj fat or chameleons' saliva.
Then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta with it. If you find it, clamp it gently and pull it slowly until it comes out. If it is stuck deep in the uterus, insert the hand as described until you find the placenta and then pull it gently out of concern.
To prevent the uterus from falling due to strong pulling, it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left. Then increase the amount of pulling; it will respond then and detach from its attachment. If the cervix is closed, we have described the treatment with coughing and the use of the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with what we have described, be gentle in re-applying the pulling. However, you should tie what has come out to the cervix of the woman's uterus to her thigh, then apply the four-part ointment; it will ulcerate her after a few days.
It dissolves and comes out, except that if it becomes ulcerated, a bad odor will rise to the stomach and head, causing discomfort to the patient. Therefore, it is advisable to use the appropriate fumigation.
Therefore, some early尝试者曾试验过橄榄的烟和干李子，器械的样子就是用来在月经停闭和胎盘等情况下的蒸熏治疗。
It is made of lead and resembles a speculum or is made of copper with the thin end placed in front and the wider end on the fire, and the incense is held over the flame until the incense is gone, and then another one is used.
The Ninety-seventh Chapter.
In the Treatment of the Perineum Not Pierced.
Many boys are born with their perineum not pierced, which may be blocked by a thin film. The midwife should puncture this film with her finger; otherwise, she should incise it with a sharp forceps. She must be careful not to touch the muscle.
Then she places on it a cloth soaked in the drink and oil, and then treats it with ointments until it heals. If you fear that it may become blocked, insert a lead tube into the opening for several days, and remove it when the child passes feces.
And the perineum may also become blocked due to the healing of a wound or a tumor. It should be incised where the wound has healed, and then treated as we have mentioned for other cases and with lead strips.
The Eightieth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Nawsir Occurring Below.
The nawsir occurring below is a complication characterized by hardness and constriction that happens near the perineum from outside or within one of the sides. The nawsir can be one or more.
If the complication delays, it will open and discharge a white watery exudate or a thin pus. Some of these may extend to the probe and the intestine, while others may not. The ones that do extend can be identified by what comes out from them in terms of feces and gas when using the purgative enema.
Perhaps worms may come out of it, and some of these passages may extend to the bladder and the urethra. Some may extend to the knee joint and the heel. The passage that extends to the perineum can also be identified by its extension, while the non-extended ones cannot.
That you insert your third finger into the perineum and introduce a thin probe of copper or iron into the passage. If there is curvature in the passage, then introduce a thin probe of tin or a hair from a horse's tail.
Until you feel the probe or the hair in your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing comes out from the hole in terms of feces, gas, or worms as we have said, then know that it is not extended, and act promptly with treatment.
If the passage extends to the bladder or the urethra, its indication is the discharge of urine from it and its inability to adhere to the area when treated with medications. If it extends to the knee joint or the heel, its indication is the arrival of the probe there.
If there is no curvature to the bone and pain in a certain area, and thin pus continually discharges from it, and no treatment works on it and it does not adhere to ointment, then none of these extended passages will ever heal.
Treatment is in vain for those affected by it among the ignorant physicians. As for that which is not dangerous and not chronic, one hopes for its cure with iron as I have described and what I have tried, and it is that the patient be laid on his back before you.
He extends his legs upward and bends his thighs toward his belly. Then you introduce a copper or lead probe into the curvature until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, you should introduce your third finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe in your finger has passed through by itself, uncovered with no sensation of a membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is dangerous. Do not waste effort on it, as there is no cure for it as we have said.
They have said that it may cure in some people rarely. One of the treatments that one hopes will be beneficial is to heat a thin iron plate according to the size of the curvature as previously mentioned, and then introduce it hot into the curvature until it reaches near the anus, then reinsert it two or three times.
Until you know that it has burned all the excessive necrotic flesh that resembles a bird's quill. Then treat it with a moistened sponge in oil until the burned flesh is removed, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Otherwise, it will not be cured by anything other than this treatment. As for when you introduce the probe and it does not pass to your finger in the anus, and there is a thick barrier of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the curvature as the surface of the skin, then at that time cut the skin from the beginning of the curvature. And as you pass the incision with the probe in the nostril until you reach with the incision where the end of the probe has reached and the probe discharges and falls out, then you cleanse those congealed meats that resemble bird feather tubes and nothing remains of them.
Then treat it with ointments of healing until it heals. If the blood overcomes you and obstructs your work by those congealed meats, the best and quickest remedy is to cauterize them by fire or with a sharp medicine, for cauterization by fire joins two good states: burning those excessive congealed meats.
And cut the blood and evaporate the moisture, then treat it with ointment-soaked wool in oil or powdered sulfur in oil until the wound discharges and those burned meats come out in the discharge. Then treat the wound subsequently with healing ointments that break up hard flesh.
And they are the medicines that have a constricting and drying effect; for if it constricts, then it has healed and there will be no recurrence. If the nostril has reached the depth of the nasal cavity but is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the nasal cavity and probe with it.
And if you feel the probe and there is a barrier between you and it of phlegm or flesh, and it is close to the source, then the only treatment is by hope and prayer. You should use one of three approaches: either cauterize it as we have said.
And either pass the probe until you reach its bottom to be able to introduce the ointment and treatment from close range, without overpassing the incision to avoid cutting the muscle surrounding the nasal cavity, which might lead to involuntary defecation. Then treat it as we have mentioned; perhaps it will heal as we said.
And either you remove that curtain and puncture it after cutting it near the sitz bath as we said, either with a探针或是其他尖端的工具，然后你需要清除切口中的所有凝固肉组织直至你能探测到的地方。
Then cauterize the wound entirely with the incision and the upper lip until it heals, leaving the nozzle open inside the sitz bath, which will be more comfortable for the patient. The nozzle may also rupture in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the nozzle and it is located on one side of the sitz bath near the surface of the body with the skin and the ring of the sitz bath, then take a探针位于坐浴盆的一侧，靠近身体表面的皮肤和坐浴环，取一个尖端有孔的探针，如挖耳针一样：
And insert a woven thread of five strands or so into it. Then, insert the probe with the thread into the nozzle until it reaches the bottom. If it passes through the edge of the sitz bath from inside near it.
Then, remove the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the sitz bath and pulling out the end of the thread. Gather both ends together, pull them tightly, and leave it for a day or two. Each time the thread cuts through the flesh, pull it tight thoroughly until the flesh between the threads is cut and falls off. Then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
And if the nozzle lip is not perforated, perforate it as much as possible, except that if it is deep, you should not do so for fear of cutting the muscle. Then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
The image of the spiny forceps with which the ribs are separated has a very sharp end for clamping and the other end is not sharp so as not to cut what is not needed, as you can see.
The eighty-first section.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids that bleed and their excision and the healing of the incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds. Either they are inside the rectum, resembling the lips of a woman or like grapes, some small and some large, and blood always flows from them.
And they can be single or multiple. They can also be external, near the edges of the rectum. However, these external hemorrhoids are generally less moist; yellow water or little blood slowly flows from them continuously and they appear to match the color of the body.
The treatment for hemorrhoids inside the rectum is to advise the patient to purge and cleanse until the rectum expels its contents, revealing the hemorrhoids. You should then tie them with forceps or grasp them with your fingernail, and cut them off at their base. If the forceps do not hold due to their moisture and laxity.
Tie it with a rough cloth or a piece of iron wire, or grasp it with your fingers, then cut it off. After cutting, sprinkle some sharp charcoal pieces on it to serve as an alternative to cauterization, or burn it as described in the section on cauterization.
Then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the rectum does not expel its contents, administer a purge to the patient containing a little laxative to cleanse what is in the rectum and facilitate its quick expulsion when the patient cleanses. Squeeze out the hemorrhoids that have come out of the rectum gently and easily.
And take it with your nail or suspend it with forceps and cut it then treat it as we mentioned until it heals. And if one dislikes cutting with iron, it is advisable to use pincers in this manner: take a wound thread and insert it into a needle.
Then draw the cyst upwards and puncture it with the needle from its base on the other side. Wrap the ends of the thread around the needle, which is crossed over the cyst, and pull the cyst tightly. Tighten the thread and remove the needle. Do this for all cysts, leaving one unharmed.
To expel its bloody contents, then place a cloth soaked in rose or cucumber oil on the cyst and put it over the cyst. Order the patient to remain still, then leave him until the cysts fall off. If they fall off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
As for the treatment of scarring, it often occurs from dryness and the grip of the nature. If it lingers and no remedy works, it is advisable to excise it with forceps or your nail until it becomes moist and the upper crust that prevents its healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as much as it should. If it does not heal, redress it with a more severe excision until it heals properly and sloughs off. Then treat it, for it will heal.
The Second and Eighty-First Chapter.
On the Treatment of Bent and Straight Pins, Hard Cysts, and Wart.
The nail is a round knot in the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, found throughout the body but especially in the soles of the feet and fingers. Pain from it often occurs during walking.
It is necessary to cut around the nail and extract it with a scalpel or forceps, then remove it from its root. If you wish, treat it as mentioned in the relevant section for that. As for the hard wart, each one is a small rough hardened round growth on the surface of the body.
It often occurs in the hands of boys. Its treatment is to expand the wart and cut it or rub it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off. If you wish, treat it as mentioned with fire or with sharp medicine.
Warts, whether inverted or not, can be removed with the instrument described in the treatment for the ant. As for the ant, it is also a small rough hardened growth that penetrates deeply into the body's surface; if it is affected by cold, one feels something similar to an ant bite within it.
It can occur throughout the body, but is more common in the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube from an ostrich feather or a strong eagle feather and make that tube surround the ant until the circle of the tube encompasses it from all sides. Then, turn your hand with the tube until you cut around the ant.
It can penetrate deep into the flesh, and the ant will be removed from its root. If you prefer, you can use a copper or iron tube in this manner.
The upper tube to the tendons is stiffened and folded for ease of finger control and manipulation, and if you prefer, seal the needle as mentioned earlier for blister treatment in the section on blistering.
The Third and Eighth Chapter.
In the images of the instruments used for injection in cases of dysuria, diarrhea, and smallpox.
It can be made of silver or copper or brass, either drawn or beaten. These instruments can be made in small and large sizes according to the users. It should be made small for use in treating young boys whose urethras are narrow or stricture-prone. The syringe should be very delicate. Image of a large syringe:.
The top stopcock through which the fluid is drawn should be wide in this manner, with a stop to attach the fluid as you see. Its lower end, which enters the urethra, should be stiff and very smooth towards the tendons. On one side, there are two holes, and on the other side, one hole.
The hole should be of the size of a thumb's breadth or slightly larger. The tube through which you place the medicine, made from the bladder of an animal or the skin of a sheep, should be crafted in the shape of a small spoon.
It should have many holes, spaced as much as the width of a finger apart. Then, a thin thread made from doubled woolen threads, about ten strands or similar, is inserted into these holes, and the fluid is drawn in like a spoon. If the medicine is placed therein, tighten at the head of the injected between the stones tightly, then inject it, and this is a figure of the circle of the ziqq and the hole.
The method of administering it is to fill the bladder with the medicine, heated to a temperature that can be tolerated by the patient, and beware that it should not be too hot or too cold. Then, lie the patient on his back and elevate his legs above his head.
It is placed under him a mat or a blanket. Then, the tip of the cannula is smeared with ointment or egg white or dodder sap or similar substances. Then it is inserted into the cavity gently. The patient then holds the ziqq (a type of cannula) with both hands and presses it tightly until all that is in the cannula is discharged into the intestines.
Then, the cannula is removed and the patient is made to elevate his legs against the wall. If the medicine stimulates him to defecate, he should strain as much as he can. If he sleeps through the night, it is more effective for the condition. If the cannula is used for cases of diarrhea and he needs to expedite the discharge, the procedure should be repeated until he recovers.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the cavity, the cannula should be very smooth and gentle, different from those used for boys. This is a figure of a gentle cannula with its skin tightly stretched on it.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
In the Treatment of Wounds.
I have already discussed the division of treatment similar to cauterization, and here I will treat the application by hand and with medicines as perfectly as possible. I say that wounds differ according to the thing causing the wound and according to the place where it occurs.
The things in which surgeries are found are many, such as a stone strike or a sword cut or a knife wound or a spear thrust or a rod or an arrow and the like from many things.
And as for the surgeries according to the places of the body, they are such as the wound that occurs on the head or the neck or the chest or the abdomen or the liver and the like from the organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some surgeries to make it a measure and a rule for all other surgeries. I begin with simple head injuries especially, because the compound ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
And I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture, look whether it was caused by a stone or something similar, and whether it only pierced the skin and the wound is large, and fearing the occurrence of a hot swelling in the patient, treat it promptly and apply cold compresses at the site. And do not delay this. Let him bleed from the wound according to his strength if there is no obstruction to bleeding. This is especially true if the blood coming from the wound is small. The bleeding should be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
And warn the patient against filling up, drinking thick liquids, and eating heavy foods. If something prevents bleeding, reduce food intake and avoid meat and strong drinks. Apply a cloth soaked in rose oil alone or with a drink that has contracting properties to the wound if it develops a hot swelling.
And if you are concerned about the hot swelling, apply his blood to the wound if it is fresh and has not been changed by the respiratory air, which I will describe to you shortly. If the air has already changed it, apply some ointments to it.
Until the pus matures, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and is from a sword cut or similar and its edges did not come together with the vessels, suture it as I have described in suturing abdominal wounds.
If the skin has revealed the bone and is hanging loose, with its hold being only by a slight ligament, cut it off then treat the wound with medicines that will cause solid flesh to grow in its place of the skin. Order the patient to nourish himself with foods that are strengthening, such as meats and lentils and the like.
If corruption occurs in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, cut out all the corrupted tissue, throw it away, then treat the wound. If there is a vein or artery in these wounds that bleeds but the bleeding does not stop with medicines, examine the vessel.
If it did not necrose, amputate it with the forceps and ligate it. If necessity demands and what we have mentioned does not help, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and shallow, treat them easily and gently, sufficient treatment being to sprinkle them with this salve while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes it, a prescription of salve is: take of frankincense one part, and of myrrh two parts, and of ashes of lime or unquenched lime three parts. Crush all of them, sift them, and apply them to the wound and tie it tightly so that it adheres well.
It congeals with the blood, then tie it from above with the vessels and leave it alone without loosening it as long as it does not swell; for the medicine will not come off until it heals. The ash may do this by itself if frankincense and myrrh are not available.
And this may also be done with a tube in many large operations if he masters its placement upon it and tightens it, and the operation is soft by its blood without changing until the air changes it somewhat, especially if it is in the time of summer.
And there is no active meaning in placing this tube. It may be filled with some mature ointments or with a porridge made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until the pus exudes, then it should be treated with other treatments until it heals.
And if there is a fracture of the bone with the wound and it is slight,牵引牵引之，用夹板固定，关于头部骨折的治疗已在颈部手术中提及。若伤口发生在颈部，则其治疗与轻微的头部伤口并无区别。
And if it cuts a nerve or a vein in the neck, and if it is a nerve, there is no remedy other than to avoid treating it with anything that constricts severely, such as zanjir, zağ, and similar substances, because they harm the nerve and spasm it.
And nothing cold should be applied to the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold. Its connection with the brain, which is the most noble of organs, should be avoided. What you treat it with should be gentle medicines such as a wet napkin soaked in fresh water, or oiled with rose or tangerine oil.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other metallic stones in this manner, and ointments, then if the wound is large use stitching or suture its lips with ligatures, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound is deep and contains a concealed collection at its bottom where pus has accumulated, incise it in the lowest part thereof. If a vessel has been severed within the wound and its blood is still flowing, amputate it or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity demands so.
If the wound has cut some or all of the pharyngeal sinuses and the ears are intact, suture the skin lips over the pharynx tube without touching the pharynx itself, but smooth and replace it to its natural shape, then tighten it firmly and leave it for days.
Then treat it with ointments that cause contraction and drying until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, fracture it. If there are bone fragments in it, extract all of them or as many as possible. If you cannot extract them, leave it until the wound suppures and heals, making its extraction easier.
If the wound is raw, sprinkle it with the decorticating powder as described. If it suppurates in the wound and becomes a sinew, treat it with what will be mentioned in its section, in Surgery of the Chest and Between the Shoulders.
If it is a thrust from a spear or sword and you see that it is deep, examine it. If air comes out when the injured person breathes, know that it is a fighting wound. If it is not deep but raw with blood, do not apply any decorticating powder at first, lest the blood be obstructed in its depth.
If it reaches the heart, it will kill the injured person. But apply a attractive ointment to it and let him apply it twice a day during the daytime. If you have no ointment, place a soft cloth in the wound to absorb what comes out of it, and keep the injured person with his head lowered over the wound.
Let it heal if it meets the condition, even though three days or more have passed since the wound, and there is no convulsion nor severe fainting nor oppression in the chest, and I have seen all his conditions suitable. Know then that the wound is healed, treat it with suturing and other treatments until he recovers.
If vision is impaired and the swelling continues unabated, know that it has become a carbuncle. Treat it accordingly; for the ulcers of such wounds let them heal by suturing, even if three days or more have passed since the wound on the chest or back, treat it with the previously mentioned suturing methods.
If it is large or in the glands if it is small, if it has affected the bone and broken off fragments from it, examine the wound and act promptly to remove those fragments if they are clean. If they are not clean, leave them until they become so.
It corrupts the wound, making it easier to remove. As for other recent wounds in other organs, their treatment follows what we have mentioned.
The Fifth and Eighty-First Chapter.
On Wounds of the Abdomen and Protrusion of Intestines and Their Suturing.
The tear in the abdomen may be large or small and medium. The large tear may protrude intestines or several intestines, making their insertion and suturing harder and more difficult.
The small tear, too, may be harder in another respect; hence, its repositioning is more difficult. The intestines, if not inserted into their proper place soon after protrusion, will swell and become harder to insert. Therefore, the medium-sized tear has become the best among tears because it does not make the repositioning of the intestines as difficult as in these two types.
Know that the stitching of the abdomen is upon four aspects. The two common stitches are suitable for stitching the abdomen and other body surgeries. The other two specialized stitches apply to all surgeries, although they are more particularly suited for stitching the abdomen.
And as I describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification, I say that if the wound is small and something from the intestine has come out and it is difficult to return it, then this is for one of two reasons: either because the tear is small, as we said, or because the intestine was inflated before its return due to air pressure.
And if this is the case, it should be warmed by soaking a wet sponge or cloth in tepid water alone, or in water boiled with Decumbens and Saffron and Belladonna. Then it should be applied to the intestine until the inflation subsides.
And the drink that has griping herbs in it is better than water alone for resolving the inflation. If you see that the inflation has subsided, then moisten the intestine with water boiled with Cinnamon or Baker's Fennel, as it facilitates its entry more easily.
And if return of the intestine is still impossible after this treatment, a small incision should be made in the tear with the instrument used for piercing steel. The first method, if successful, is preferable to the incision. One is forced to make the incision only as a last resort when all other methods have failed. This is the form of the instrument:
Its one end is bent and limited, while the other end is unlimited. The thin end is not as fine as the forceps, but slightly broader. It resembles a small awl, as you can see. If the wound enlarges and the intestine enters, it should be returned to its natural shape.
And its specific place, if you can manage it, is best. As for when the wound is large and is in the lower part of the abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs elevated above his head. And when it is in the upper part of the abdomen, he should have his head and chest elevated above his feet.
And likewise, if the wound is in one of the sides of the abdomen, make your aim and purpose to have the side with the surgery elevated above the other side. Thus, this should be applied in great surgeries as well as in medium-sized ones.
As for small surgeries, place him as you are able to. Then, have before you a kind attendant who holds the entire wound with both hands, brings together its lips, then reveals a bit at a time to the one performing the suturing.
This is the characteristic of a common suture: you take one needle or several needles according to the size of the wound. Then, leave a finger's breadth from one edge of the wound and insert one needle without putting any thread into the edges of the skin. With the edges of the flaps beneath the skin from within, you pass them from that side. Then, you gather both edges of the skin and both edges of the flap, making four loops. Next, you tighten a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound meet tightly.
Then, leave a finger's breadth and insert another needle. Tighten it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with the needles as needed until you complete suturing the entire wound. Let the needles be of medium thickness between the thick and the thin.
Because very thin needles cut the flesh quickly and easily, and similarly, they are difficult to enter the skin near tough areas, therefore, it should be medium in softness and hardness, and the needle should not be inserted close to the edge of the skin.
To prevent the flesh from cutting quickly and the wound from opening before healing, and to ensure that the suturing is not too far apart so as not to hinder the wound's healing, then cut the ends of the needles to avoid injuring the patient when asleep, and provide it with ties from torn linen cloth on all sides to hold the needle ends.
And leave it until you know that the wound has healed. This type of suturing with needles is most appropriate for small surgeries, as it may suffice with one or two needles or similar.
Or as for the method of suturing for the second general case, it is to gather the four edges with one stitch, meaning the edges of the skin and the edges of the membrane, using a needle with a folded thread of medium softness and hardness. Then, when these four edges are sewn with this needle, withdraw the needle from the same side where you started.
Let the thread be tied from above the wound, so that the suturing is done according to the method of tying goods with a knot. Make sure there is some thickness of the small finger between each stitch and this type of suturing is known by all people.
And with this suturing, a wound was treated in a man's belly who had been cut by a knife, and the size of the surgical tear was more than an inch. Two inches of the middle intestine had come out, and the tear was in the center of the belly.
He repeated it after the intestines remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and he treated it until it痊愈，之后又活了很多年，能够应对各种状况。医生们断定他绝不会再痊愈了。
And it is wonderful that I did not treat him with a ointment, for I was in a place where there was nothing of the medicines. So I would place a wet cotton on the wound twice a day and take care to wash it with honey water until it healed.
And as for one of the two types of specialized suturing, I will mention it in the words of Galen: Begin with suturing the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. Once you have passed the needle through the skin and the muscle going straight along the length of the abdomen.
I left the edge of the membrane on the side where I inserted the needle and passed the needle through its other edge from inside to outside in the other margin of the membrane. Once I have done this, I passed it again through the same margin of the membrane from outside to inside.
And leave the edge of the membrane on this side, pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and as you pass it through the membrane, also pass it to the edge of the muscle on that side, until you pass all of them.
Then begin also from this side and suture it with the edge of the membrane on the other side. Remove the needle from the skin near it, then push it back into that skin and suture the edge of the membrane on the other side with this edge of the muscle.
And remove it from the skin on that side, and do that again and do it time after time until you sew the entire surgery according to that example. And in brief, this manner of sewing is like the sewing of the falconers for the falcon.
And sew the septum from one side with the skin edge and leave it open on the other side until you finish, as for the second type of special sewing mentioned by Galen, this is exactly what he said.
And sew it according to the example that some physicians sew it, by bringing each part together with its counterpart naturally, joining the edge of the septum to its other edge and the edge of the margin to its other edge, as I describe to you.
You should stitch the margin of the margin close to you from outside, penetrating it only and leaving the septal margins. Then withdraw the needle and reinsert it from outside to inside in both septal margins, withdrawing it also.
And pass it from inside to outside in the other margin of the margin on the opposite side. This type of sewing is better than the easy general sewing that you have been shown. This is exactly what Galen said. Some have also said that the abdominal stitching can be done with two needles. And do this by inserting one thread into both and starting by inserting the needle from your side, passing it to the other side. Insert the other needle from the opposite side and pass it back from your side according to the manner of masons' sewing.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, suturing it is harder than at other places in the abdomen. As for the treatment of the injury, its rule in curing is like that of all injuries; namely, if you encounter the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and return the intestines and suture and secure it, apply upon it the heated irons.
If the wound has been changed by the air, apply some ointments that you prepare until it suppurates and the sutures drop out and the edges unite. Then treat it as you treat other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, apply to it old cotton when it begins to suppurate and change it twice a day as I have taught you until it heals. For in most cases you will not need another treatment if the wounds are simple. If you fear that the wound might involve the main organs in pain, treat it accordingly.
It is necessary to soak a soft cotton in moderately heated oil or in rose fat and place it around the areas between the navel and the hips. If he feels pain or corruption within, often this is the case; so inject him with a diluted astringent drink.
And especially if the corruption has reached the intestines and become an open wound penetrating its cavity. Know that what is thick among the intestines is easier to heal, and what is thin among them is harder to heal.
As for the intestine known as the "fasting bowel," it does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all. This is because it contains many large veins, and its inner lining is thin and close to the nature of nerves. As for if the pus from the wound protruded and you encountered it fresh, return it according to your usual method of returning the bowel.
If it persists for a time and turns green or black, it should be tied above the place that turned black to prevent bleeding, for there are veins and arteries in the swelling. Then cut what is below that bandage.
And make the ends of the thread attached from below the surgery outside of it to make it easier for you to pull and remove when the swelling and wound discharge occur. This refers to the wound that appears in the intestine; if a tear appears in the intestine and is small.
For it may heal in some people, as I have seen a man who was stabbed in his abdomen by an arrow; the wound was on the right side of the stomach. The wound healed and became a fistula from which feces and gas would exit. I treated him without hoping for a cure. I continued to treat him until he recovered and the wound healed. Seeing the wound had healed, I feared that something harmful might occur within him, but indeed, he was never afflicted by any such harm and remained in his best condition. He recovered, eating and drinking normally, engaging in sexual activity, using the bath, and being well attended to. Some practitioners have noted that when a wound appears in the intestine and is small, it should be sutured in this manner.
It should be taken thus: The heads of large ants are first extracted, then the edges of the wound are gathered, and an ant is placed there with its mouth open over the wound's edges. When it grabs and tightens its mouth, cut off its head; for it adheres and does not come loose. Then place another ant near the first one.
And continue to do so with many ants in proportion to the wound, then replace them and suture the wound; for those heads will remain stuck in the intestines until they cause it to swell and the patient recovers. No harm will come to the affected person at all, and the intestines can also be sutured with fine thread.
He who excises from the two canals the sticky substance adhering to the animal after it enters a needle, should take the end of this thread from the canals and excise some tissue. Then he should tie at its end a thin folded cotton thread, and then insert that thread into the needle. And there is a thread from the canals which is used to suture the intestines, then it is replaced into the body. This method of suturing with ants and canals is based on hope and expectation.
And if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, there is no remedy for it at all, and it will not recover at all.
The Sixth and Eighth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Common Cold and Nasal Discharge.
Know that every wound or tumor, if it lingers and becomes old and turns into a chronic ulcer without healing and continues to discharge pus, is called a nasour in general for any body part. We call it a common cold, and the nasour.
It is in reality a stiff, white concretion without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
And for this reason, some have called it a feather. At times, it becomes wet and continues to discharge pus constantly; at other times, the wetness may cease. The wetness can be abundant or scanty, thick or thin.
And I have mentioned in the division when describing wounds that every wound which does not heal and in which flesh does not grow, is due to one of nine causes. One of these causes is either a deficiency of blood in the body or its poor quality or because there is within it and on its edges solid flesh that prevents the growth of good flesh. And either because it is full of pain and filthiness, or because the wound itself is putrid and the material that nourishes it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used to treat it is not appropriate, or because there has been a deterioration in the locality due to the nature of the epidemic, or because of something specific to the locality.
And either because it is full of pain and filthiness, or because the wound itself is putrid and the material that nourishes it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used to treat it is not appropriate, or because there has been a deterioration in the locality due to the nature of the epidemic, or because of something specific to the locality. As was presented in the city of Sargasso, where it is difficult for diseases to mature and tumors to heal naturally, either because there is one bone or several bones. I have explained all these causes and their symptoms and treatments with medicines in the division.
And here, I must acquaint you with the treatment of fistula and colds that occur through manual intervention. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body; some lead to large veins or arteries, or to nerves.
Or to a sinus, or to an intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint composed of many parts such as the hand and the foot. Some may lead to a part near a major organ or something similar.
For those fistulas of this nature, they are among the diseases that are difficult to heal and do not respond to treatment or effort. If there are fistulas that do not reach these mentioned locations, then there is hope for their healing.
And in order to come to know this, take a probe of copper or iron if the catheter passes straight. If there is curvature in the catheter, examine it with a thin lead probe because lead softens its body.
It will slide upon entering and bend toward the curvature. If the catheter has many openings, you cannot discern them with the probe. So inject one of its openings with moisture; it will flow towards the other openings and drain.
Then examine it in any way possible to determine if there is a bone or nerve, or if the catheter's depth is far or near, or if it has one catheter with many openings. Stand firm on all this by your full capacity of probing and the pain it causes when you gently touch the area with your hand.
And so with such signs and symptoms of the tumor, when you stand firm on all this as a reality, then proceed to the treatment with confidence, which is to look and see if it is.
The catheter is obvious and close or in a safe place distant from the joint or nerve or blood vessel or vein or any of the places mentioned to you. Cut the catheter as described above and extract from it the congealed matter, rotten flesh, and excess flesh.
And treat what grows in its opening from flesh or excrescence and the like until it heals. If the catheter has a deep base and is straight, you should cut it deeply as much as possible, then cleanse it of all its rotten flesh.
Then use the triple-threaded floss for acute medicines and insert it into the bottom of the canal which you reach with the iron. Do this several times until that sharp medicine eats all that remains in the bottom of the canal from decay.
Then apply ointments that promote healthy flesh growth until it heals. If it does not heal thereby, incise and drain as previously described. If the cause of the canal is bone and you find that satisfactory, then trephine and section it as I have instructed you, provided nothing prevents you from doing so.
If a vein or nerve or primary organ, as we have said, is revealed to you and there is some decay and blackness in it, strip it until the decay disappears. Then treat it with flesh-growing remedies until it heals. If it does not heal and the pus persists as it used to do.
Know that you have not completely removed all the decay. Therefore, expose everything again thoroughly and cleanse and remove it to the best of your ability. Then apply ointments; if it heals, otherwise know that this decay is deep within the decaying tissue, so expose everything again thoroughly.
Examine and cleanse it to the best of your ability. The decayed bone is small and you can extract it using delicate forceps suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, examine and extract all of them without leaving anything behind to the best of your ability. If something from the ligaments obstructs you and there is no danger in cutting it, then cut those ligaments and the flesh if present, and free the bones.
If it is not possible for you to extract the bones, apply something to dress the wound and leave it until the flesh and ligaments around those bones putrefy, and take care that the wound does not heal by apposition of the incision you made in your work.
But apply thereon if you fear that to cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments; for when it putrefies those ligaments and decays the bones, their extraction and traction will be easy.
If it is a large bone such as the thigh bone or shin bone, and only its surface has rotted, then thoroughly strip it of the decay until the blackness and corruption are gone, then set the wound. If a large part of it has rotted and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, it must be removed.
And cut it completely to where the corruption ends. Then treat it until it heals. I inform you of a case that was presented to a man in his thigh, so that it may serve as an example and aid in your treatment. This man was a young adult.
接近三十岁的时候，他出现了腿部疼痛的症状，原因是体内有异物活动直至与腿部相连并肿胀成巨大的肿瘤。病因并非来自外部。时间久了，医生的误诊使病情恶化，最终肿瘤破裂。
A great deal of material discharged from it, and he was poorly treated, until the leg became gangrenous with many openings discharging pus and body moisture. A group of doctors treated him for about two years, but none among them was skilled in surgical techniques.
Until he reached me, I saw his thigh and the pus flowing from those openings in great abundance. The leg had become emaciated and its color had turned yellow. I inserted the探针之一进入其中的一个开口，探针抵达了骨头，然后我彻底检查了所有的开口。
I found them communicating with each other from all sides of the thigh. I incised one of these openings until a part of the bone was revealed, and I found it corrupted, decayed, blackened, and putrefied, until the hole reached the brain, spreading what had been disclosed to me.
And I removed the corrupted bone, as I thought that there was no corruption in the bone other than what I cut and spread and had excised. Then I made use of the adhesive medicines to bind the wound for a longer period, but it did not heal. Later, I returned and revealed the bone again above the first revelation.
I found the corruption connected to the bone. I spread what had been revealed to me also from that corruption. Then I bound it again, but it did not bind or heal. I revealed it once more, and I continued cutting parts of the bone, intending to bind it, but it would not bind until I cut nearly a span from the bone.
I removed it with its brain, then bound it with medicines, and it healed quickly and recovered fully. This repetition in his treatment and incision was necessary due to the weak condition of the patient, his low tolerance, and my fear for his life, as he would frequently experience severe fainting from excessive vomiting at all times. He ultimately recovered completely.
We take from the place of the bone flesh strong and healthy, and its condition is well in its body, and its strength has diminished and it acts on its conditions without any affliction affecting it while walking, if it was a broken bone in a place in the body.
It is necessary to treat it in this manner: you take a bandage and tighten it at the end of the broken bone, and order someone to stretch it upwards. Then you make another bandage from thicker cloth than the first.
Then you bind it to the flesh beneath the bone, stretching its end so that the flesh is drawn downward. You uncover the flesh at the place you want to spread it to prevent the saw from injuring the flesh. You place a board or plank underneath the bone from below,紧贴牢固。
If you do this, the saw will not fail to cut the rotten bone. It is necessary for the spreading to be slightly above the place of decay so that there is no decay within the cavity of the bone, which would not be visible externally, forcing you to spread it again.
If the bone is rotten and not broken, but its parts are connected to each other, and the decay is in the middle or some part of it, you should uncover the flesh from all its sides. Then place the board from below, and spread it from the first side where the decay is located.
When you have finished spreading it, spread it from the other side. Let the spreading be slightly away from the decayed area as we said. If the decay is in a joint, cut the rotten joint itself and spread the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but excision. If the corruption is in the hand comb or foot comb, the matter of its cure is exceedingly difficult; yet it should be debrided as much as you can perceive and excised to the extent possible.
By what means it can be corrected if no vein or nerve obstructs you, and know that the saws and chisels for cutting these bones are many according to the position of the bones and their setting and their hardness and tenderness and size and smallness and firmness and looseness. Therefore, it should be prepared for each type of work an appropriate tool for that work.
And know that the work itself may guide you to the type of tool you need if you have a long knife and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for skill in the craft is shown by various forms of diseases. For he may infer for himself what tools resemble those needed for each disease, and I have depicted for you several tools at the end of this chapter.
Make it an example to follow and a standard by which you may measure others, if God wills, a picture of a saw:.

Seventh and Eighth Chapter:.
On Amputating the Extremities and Stripping the Bones:.
If the extremities have become infected either from an external cause or from an internal one, if you treat this corruption with medicinal remedies and the treatment is ineffective and you see that the infection is spreading in the limb, nothing deters it.
It is necessary to amputate that limb where the infection has spread, so as to save the healthy part from death or from a calamity greater than the loss of the limb. A sign that this has occurred is when the limb turns black until you think that fire has burned it.
او يعفن بعد السواد حتّى يسعى ذلك العفن الى ما يلى ذلك العضو ويأخذ فى جملة البدن فبادر بقطعه، وكذلك إن كان سبب الفساد عن لسع بعض الهوامّ كعقرب البحر او الأفعى او الرتيلاء ونحو ذلك.
If the corruption or bite is in the tip of the finger, cut off the finger and do not delay the corruption from spreading to the hand. Similarly, if it has taken hold in the hand, cut off the hand at the wrist and do not delay the corruption from spreading until it takes hold in the elbow joint.
If it has taken hold in the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow joint in the same socket. If the corruption is possible and I see that it has spread to near the hip, do not cut off the hip at all, for that would result in the death of a healthy limb. Instead, use other methods of treatment as much as is feasible.
If the corruption has taken hold in the finger, cut off the finger at one of the phalanges. If it has affected the toes, cut off the entire foot. If it has spread to the knee, cut off the thigh at the knee joint.
If the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to leave it and allow the healthy part to die. The method of cutting off the limb or preventing its spread is to tie a ligature below the site where you intend to cut and another ligature above the site.
And stretch one ligature downward and another upward. Separate the flesh between the ligatures with a broad forceps until all the flesh is revealed, then cut or spread it. It is best to place linen sutures from all directions.
Lest the saw touch the correct place and cause the patient additional pain and a hot swelling, if bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cover the spot or apply some blood-stopping powders, then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured part with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will give you an example: This symptom occurred in a man's leg, a blackness with a burning sensation like fire.
And that corruption was the first thing to happen in his finger, until it affected all of them. The man saw the corruption spreading in the part with the intense pain and burning he felt, so he had it amputated at the joint, and he recovered.
And when a long time passed, the corruption appeared in his other finger, the middle finger. He came to me, and I treated him with the medicines I applied to the hand after cleaning his body. But the corruption did not subside and began to spread to the other finger.
And the corruption spread to his hand. They took him to have his hand amputated, but I insisted on trying to stop the corruption with medicines, hoping for its subsidence and fearing his death upon amputation due to his weak condition. When he despaired of me, he went back to his hometown.
And I heard that he had his hand amputated, and he recovered. I relate this story to serve as a help for cases of this kind of disease and as a guide upon which to base treatment.

Treatment of Abscesses and the Method of Injecting Them with Medicines.
If a swelling occurs in some fleshy organs and the duration of the swelling lasts for about a day, and then it bursts or enlarges and expels all that was in it of pus, leaving the place empty as if it were a vessel.
And the skin upon which it is like cloth that has become thin and was not severely rotten to affect a bone or a nerve or a ligament; and for this reason, it deserves to be called an abscess and not a carbuncle unless its duration causes corruption to affect any of these organs.
Then it is called a carbuncle or an infection, and its treatment is to cut all of that skin out as soon as possible, especially if it has become thin and resembles cloth, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
If you suspect that the skin might adhere and its corruption is not to that extent, and there is still some thickness of flesh in the skin, treat it with injection, which is to look at the abscess; if it is large and the pus it discharges has a foul smell, inject it with medicinal medicine.
Which is a mixture of honey, oil, and honeycomb in equal parts, collected in a container and cooked on fire until the medicine thickens like thick honey. Then take what you need, dissolve it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess. Tie its opening and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then dry it out by performing this for several days until the stored discharge is cleansed and the foulness goes away. And if this medicine is not at hand, you may moisten it with water of ashes. Take ashes of vinewood or pine wood and pour water on it.
Then sift it and moisten it with it until you are certain that the stored discharge has been cleansed. If there is no likelihood of the Egyptian medicine or the water of ashes, moisten it with water and honey in which a bit of powdered zanjir has been mixed.
Or moisten it with honey and a drink mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, while the drink adheres to the stored discharge, especially if the drink has leftover grip and dries up. If you do this several times and are certain that the stored discharge has gone, moisten it with what promotes flesh growth.
Like taking some of the nخلى ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and astringent drink, or moistening it with some other ointments and medicines whose qualities we have established in the article on ointments. If the mouth of the stored discharge is narrow and cannot accommodate the syringe.
Widen it slightly with a iron or insert a triply folded wick in the Egyptian ointment or the scabies ointment until it is wide enough. And if the mouth is also wide, suture its lips and leave enough space so that the syringe can enter without excess.
And if its mouth from which the pus flows is raised above, incise it at its lowest point so that the pus flows downwards. For if the pus becomes lodged in the depth of the stored discharge, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you are unable to incise the abscess downward as desired, it is better to position the part in a way that the pus will flow out easily according to what is available to you and it must not be allowed to become obstructed at all.
And as for the adhesive medications to be placed externally on the abscess and the manner of applying them, you should take one of the adhesive ointments suited to what you want and spread it on a linen cloth. Let the cloth be sufficient to cover the entire abscess. Then, with the scissors, make a hole beside the opening of the abscess slightly wider than the opening of the abscess. Spread a layer of the soft ointment on another linen cloth to cover the hole and place it there, keeping it somewhat distant from the opening of the abscess to facilitate the drainage of pus. Do not remove the large cloth until later.
For several days, while the ointment on the abscess is kept in place, you should remove the one on the opening of the abscess at any time to allow the pus that has accumulated to drain out. You should also observe whether the discharge from it is much or little, whether it is well drained or not.
And in addition to this, examine the location of the abscess itself; whether its owner feels pain there or not, and whether there is a swelling or no swelling. If your treatment continues in this manner and you observe that the material discharging from it is minimal at the opening of the abscess.
Know that the abscess may have become adhered or is close to becoming adhered. In this case, treat it on the following day or by the third day. When the wound heals, replace the cloth with a new one and renew the ointment. If after a long period pus flows from the abscess, do not despair of its adherence.
For its healing is close, for among people some have slow growth of flesh in their wounds and others are the opposite. If it came out from concealment after many days a pus not fully matured, know that the concealment did not adhere. If it delayed adherence, know that the wound is slow to heal.
And if it lasts long, increase in the drying of the medicines. Let the medicines be such that they are wet in their consistency and dry in their strength, like the nakhli ointment if it has been increased with some qalqut (a type of plant). And what is most effective to treat it is to take the nakhli ointment.
And it can be treated with rose ointment. Pour on it the moderate-consistency old drink, then mix it with it and use it. If you do not have nakhli ointment, honey if you cook it until it thickens and use it, or take from rose, patience, and cedar, grind all of them together, and撒布在火上的蜂蜜中。 Then apply it to a cloth and tie it over the concealment, or apply it with honey that you have cooked until it thickens, sprinkle the medications on it, and place a cloth over it and tie it.
And it can be used in such cases as the long zrawnd, the root of the nameconej flower assa-gunnun, and the flour of karkinnah and qantriyun. Use them individually or mix them, grind, sift, and sprinkle on the honey as described and use it. If the concealment lasts and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
And it has affected the bones or other solid nerves or ligaments. Cure it with the treatment of naṣūr as described before.
The Ninety-eighth Chapter.
In the Treatment of the Abscess and Pain in the Nail, Cutting off the Excessive Finger, and Separating the Fingers That Are Joined Together.
The abscess is a flesh that grows abundantly under the nail of the thumb or the foot, and it may grow in any finger. If left untreated and its condition worsens, it swells into a hot inflammation.
Or it rots and destroys, eating away the root of the nail, and may even destroy the entire nail. It might extend to the bone, giving off a foul smell, and make the tip of the finger wide, with a discolored appearance. If treated as mentioned in the division and the treatment does not succeed.
It is necessary to cut with iron all the flesh that grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound. For cauterization in this case is highly beneficial. If, however, the bone is sound and the nail is also sound, this may not be necessary.
And if the corner of the nail had pressed the flesh inward, causing it to decay and become infected, it is necessary to place a thin dressing under the corner of the nail that is decaying, raise it above, and cut that flesh gently.
And apply caustic medicines to what remains of the flesh until it is completely gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the decay has affected the bone, it is necessary to cut that bone out and remove it; for nothing will heal while there is a decaying bone in it at all.
If you see decay and corruption setting in at the finger, amputate it during one of the peaceful periods as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals. If the nail is struck or bruised and severe pain occurs therein, it should be lanced first.
Then lance the nail with a sharp forceps making an oblique incision from above downward, being careful not to reach the flesh beneath the nail, for this will cause severe pain and lead to excessive growth of flesh in that place. Then treat the area with what relieves pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes develops in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshly, or it may have bones in some parts, and it may also have a nail. The growth of some parts of it may occur at the base of a joint of certain fingers.
Or its growth may occur in some of the phalanges of the finger, which grow in certain phalanges that do not move, and which grow near the joint of the finger; it may move. In such cases, if it is entirely fleshly, cut it off as it is easier to do so by cutting it at its base with a wide forceps.
As for the growth at the base of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so one should avoid cutting it off. As for the growth that occurs in the finger near one of the peaceful periods, it should be cut off first, removing its flesh in a circular manner towards the bone, then exposing the bone with one of those files suitable for this purpose.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the fusion that occurs between some fingers, this often happens and is something that can be born with. It occurs when a wound or fire burn, and the like, causes the flesh to close over it. In such cases, you should lance that fusion.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, then place between them a needle or prick soaked in rose oil so that it does not adhere quickly.分开它们或在两者之间放一张薄铁片，直到伤口如应地愈合。
And likewise, if the adhesion of some fingers to the palm is exposed, cut that adhesion according to what appears suitable and fits to shape the member.
The Ninety-ninth Chapter.
In cutting the ligaments.
The ligaments are twisted, thick, filled with dark red blood vessels. They occur in most body parts, but most frequently in the legs, particularly in the thighs, calves, and laborers. It should first be treated by vigorously shaking the body from black gall several times.
Then lance the basilicus vein. As for its treatment with iron, it is performed in two ways: one is to cut and remove the black blood, and the other is to incise and completely drain the venous blood. As for cutting, it should be done as follows: first, lance the leg with hot water thoroughly.
Until the thick, dark blood dissolves, then tie the leg of the well from above his thigh to below his knee with a bandage. Then incise the vein in one place or two places or three wide incisions.
Then, squeeze the black blood with your hand from below the leg upwards and from above downwards until you have removed enough blood that you consider sufficient or what the well can bear. Then tie him up and order him to avoid foods that produce black gall. The process is then repeated by vomiting and lancing.
When the veins are filled and this harms the patient, as for leeching it should be done in this manner: if the leg of the patient has much hair, then shave its leg. Then enter him into the bath and wrap his leg with hot water until it turns red and sweat is produced or a strong workout suffices.
If no bath is available to warm the limb, then scrape the skin along the vein either at its top near the knee or at its bottom near the heel. Then open the skin with forceps and strip the vein from all sides until it becomes apparent by touch.
And when it appears, you will see it red and pale. After it is freed from the skin, you will see it like a tendon. Then insert it wet, until it rises and comes out of the skin. Hang it with a smooth blind forceps, then make another incision near that incision about three fingers' width.
Then strip the skin from the vein until it is exposed. Raise it with wet forceps as you did before, and hang it with another forceps as you did first. Make another incision or multiple small incisions if needed.
Then leech it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Pull it and leech it until it comes out of the second incision. Then pull it up to the incision above, and do this until you pull it from the third incision all the way up to all the incisions. Cut it when it is fully pulled out.
If it does not respond to pulling and leeching, insert a needle with a strong twisted thread and tie it. Pull it and insert the wet forceps under it, and manipulate your hand in all directions until it comes out, being careful that it does not break. If it breaks, you will find it difficult to leech it thoroughly.
If the ill one is harmed by it, administer it wholly. Place wool soaked in a drink and red ointment or oil on the site of the injuries, and treat until it heals. If the inflammation is contracted with folds and twists towards certain sides, note it.
And if it is not in a straight line as we said, it should be slit along every fold and place of its twist, then tied with tourniquets until it relaxes completely. When cutting, take care not to cut the veins or injure them; otherwise, it may be difficult to dilate it.
Image of the slit made in the inflammation:
Image of the Blind Tourniquet:
It should not have a beak like other tourniquets. It should be blunt at the tip to avoid cutting the vein and should be thick and smooth, as if it were thickened. Otherwise, its thinness would cut the vein with its fineness. Therefore, it should have a thickened protrusion as we said.
The Ninety-Ninth Chapter.
On Dilating the Civil Vein.
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab lands, and in hot, arid, moderately fertile regions. It may also develop in other parts of the body besides the legs, arising from an infection that occurs beneath the skin.
It occurs within living bodies, maggots, and the gnats of blains, as well as maggots that develop between the skin and flesh. The sign of the onset of this condition is inflammation in the leg followed by a discharge from the affected area, after which the vein begins to emerge from that site.
If it appears to be a plant or an animal, then when its extremity becomes visible, it should be wrapped in a small piece of lead whose weight is from one dirham to two dirhams and tied off, leaving the lead hanging from the stem.
Whenever something comes out, wrap it in the lead and tie it off. If it becomes long, cut off part of it and wrap the rest, but do not cut it from its root before it has all come out, for if you cut it, it will wither and enter the flesh, causing a swelling and a bad ulcer in the place.
Therefore, it should be drawn gradually until it comes out completely, leaving nothing in the body. It may come out from this vein in some people, being as long as five finger-breadths and ten.
And I have heard that it came out to a man for twenty finger-breadths. If it breaks off during your treatment, then insert mercury in its place and dilate it thoroughly with the body until all the material within is expelled, and try to cure the area with medicines for several days.
Then treat him for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the foot or in the foot itself, causing multiple openings from which branches come out. Treat it as described in the division and as previously mentioned.

This disease is called in some of our countries a sickness of cows because it often affects cows and she is a small single worm that develops between the skin and flesh and moves throughout the whole body ascending and descending.
It is discernible by touch upon its tickling from one part to another until it penetrates wherever it penetrates in the skin a place, and it comes out forming it from corruption of some mixtures as is often the case with worms and blisters of gourds in the belly.
And indeed, one should expect from its harm that when it moves in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and come out, thereby ruining the eye. This happens often. If you want to treat it and expel it, this can only be done when it tickles and becomes apparent to touch.
It is necessary to tie what is above it and below it with a tight bandage. Then, cut open and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you do not find it, apply heat to the area with fire until it burns it. As we have said, one should expect it to cause harm to the eye to a great extent.
If you see it has gone to the head near the eye, tie tightly under it on the forehead, then cut open and remove it. It is necessary to treat the patient with medicines that purify the body from the corrupt mixtures, and to avoid foods that generate corruption.
The Third Ninety Chapter.
On Cutting for the Disease Known as Nafar.
This disease which we call nafar in our country is a pain that appears in some organs and then transfers from organ to organ, and I have seen it as described to you.
I was called to a sick woman in some wilderness. She uncovered her arm and I perceived a slight pulsation in the vein of the arm's bracelet. After an hour, I saw that pulse moving with the artery as the worm moves up to its elbow, faster than can be imagined, like mercury.
If the pain flows from one place to another, it disappears from that place and settles in the elbow. Then, after a while, it flows throughout the entire body until it reaches the other arm. She told me that her whole body shook as I observed.
I was amazed at the speed of its transfer from one organ to another. Before I saw this disease with my own eyes in such a manner, I had only seen groups of people experiencing pain that transferred from one organ to another, but not as clearly and distinctly as I saw it in this woman.
I did not realize this until I understood that the woman was from the desert, lean-bodied with exposed veins. This is why the transferring pulse was discernible to the touch. It follows that it would not be visible in those who are well-off and have hidden, vein-covered bodies.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels the pain, it will become visible to the naked eye as we have mentioned. Tighten above and below it with a clamp and cut through it until that heated pulse is removed, and the area is cleansed.
If you do not see it with your own eyes, examine it by fumigating the body and what is meant to dispel winds and散掉它们，例如豌豆子和斯肯宾杰尔子以及类似的一些药物。这里的“散掉它们”似乎不完整或有误，可能是指某种治疗方法或处理方式，请根据上下文补全。请检查并修正以获得准确翻译。
Chapter Forty-Nine.
Extraction of Arrows.
Arrows may differ according to their types and the parts of the body in which they are located. As for the difference by types, some are large and small, some are hollow glass and some are solid glass, and some have three corners and four corners.
And some have tongues and some have shards. As for the difference according to the organs in which they are located, they are of two kinds: either the organs are among the principal hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, and bladder and similar organs. If an arrow is lodged in one of these organs, and you observe the signs of death that I will describe to you later, it should be avoided to extract that arrow from the body, as death usually ensues for the patient in most cases. And if you do not observe these bad signs and the arrow has not pierced deeply into the organ, extract it and treat the wound. As for the signs of the brain, if an arrow strikes it and pierces through the bone and wounds the dura mater covering the brain, then he is exposed to severe headache, vertigo, and dizziness.
And if you do not observe these bad signs and the arrow has not pierced deeply into the organ, extract it and treat the wound. As for the signs of the brain, if an arrow strikes it and pierces through the bone and wounds the dura mater covering the brain, then he is exposed to severe headache, vertigo, and dizziness. And redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting once or twice. Blood may come out from the nostrils or ears, or speech may be lost with the voice going away. From the wound place, white moisture resembling porridge may come out, flowing like watery meat.
If you see these signs, withhold treatment for the wounded and extraction of the arrow if it has not been removed. As for the signs of the arrow if it struck the heart and is near the left breast and you feel it as though it had penetrated something solid rather than something empty.
Perhaps the arrow has a movement resembling the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound. Following this, there is retraction of the limbs and cold sweat, and fainting occurs. Know that death is certain in such cases. As for the signs of the arrow if it wounds the lung, yellowish-bile blood comes out from the wound.
The vessels that follow the neck swell, and the wound changes color. The breathing is high-pitched, and cold air is sought. If the arrow struck the diaphragm in the chest, it would be close to the smaller ribs, with heavy breathing accompanied by severe pain.
He heaves and all the muscles of the flanks move. If the arrow struck the liver, this was followed by severe pain and blood came out of the wound resembling the color of the liver. If the arrow struck the stomach, something undigested might come out of the wound.
It is evident. If the arrow struck the abdomen and caused it to swell, and something from the feces came out of the wound or a intestine had ruptured, there is no hope for treatment nor for extracting the arrow. If the arrow struck the bladder and urine came out.
Something protruded outward, and the pain intensified for the wounded. Know that he is lost. As for other parts such as the face, eyes, throat, shoulders, arms, spine, vertebras, thighs, legs, and similar parts, it is generally accepted that they remain unaffected.
When the arrow did not hit a vein or nerve and was not poisoned, and I inform you of some of what I have seen concerning these arrows so that you may infer from it a means of treatment, namely that an arrow struck a man in his meqat al-ayni at the root of the nose.
He extracted it for him from the other side under the auricular cartilage and he recovered without anything happening to his eye, and I extracted another arrow from a Jew who was struck by it in the cartilage of his eye under the lower eyelid; the arrow had embedded itself, and I only managed to remove its small point that adhered to the wood.
It was a large arrow from the composite csii arrows, square iron without feathers. It had no fletching. The Jewish man recovered and nothing harmful happened to his eye, and I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian; the arrow was an Arabic one.
It was the one that had two feathers, and I split it between the windpipes. It had penetrated his throat, so I extracted it gently until it came out, and the Christian recovered and was cured. I also extracted another arrow from a man who was struck in his belly, and we estimated that he would die from it.
He remained for a period of thirty days or so, and nothing changed in his condition. I split the arrow and maneuvered to extract it, and he recovered without anything harmful happening to him. I saw a man struck by an arrow on his back, and the wound healed over it.
After seven years, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh. I saw a woman who was struck in her belly by an arrow; the wound healed, but the arrow remained embedded, and nothing changed in her condition, nor did she find it harmful to any of her natural actions.
I saw another man who was hit by an arrow in his face, and the wound united, and he did not find much pain from it. Such cases are many. I removed an arrow from a commander of the Sultan who had been struck in the middle of his nose, which had slightly tilted to the right side.
The arrow was completely gone. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck, and found the arrow wound very narrow. I probed it with a thin probe and did not feel any obstruction, but he felt a depression and pain on his right side under his ear.
I hoped that this depression was caused by the arrow's tip. I dressed the wound with a dressing that had strong suction and expectorant properties, hoping that it would swell and show an arrow mark. I probed further, but nothing happened in the wound that indicated the arrow had reached the area.
I continued to dress the wound with the dressing for many days, and nothing happened. I applied a cautery within the wound, and the patient remained hopeful but unable to remove the arrow. Eventually, he felt the arrow inside his nose one day, so he informed me. I then applied strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until the wound opened and I felt the thin arrow tip sticking to the wood. I then increased the application of the strong, corrosive medicine to further open the wound. The arrow tip became visible, and it took me about four months to remove it.
Then, when the wound expanded and I was able to insert forceps into it, I pulled and moved the arrow. It did not respond by coming out. I continued to gently treat it and devise methods using various instruments until one day I was able to grasp it with tight forceps, as illustrated in the later part of this chapter.
And the doctors had judged that his nasal cartilage would not heal. He healed it, and the wound mended, and the patient recovered completely, nothing troubling him at all. I will inform you of the method for extracting some arrows so that you may use this as a measure and example for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and their detail cannot be grasped by description nor encompassed by a book. Only the skilled craftsman measures the little by the much, infers what is absent from what is present, and deduces new works and new machines in times of strange emergencies.
If you descend from this craft, I say that arrows are extracted from the parts of the body in which they became embedded in two ways: either by pulling from the place where it entered or by extracting from the opposite side, the one that exited from where it entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshly place, in which case it should be pulled out and extracted. If it does not come out by itself from the position where it entered, you should leave it for several days until the flesh around it decays, making it easier to pull and extract. Similarly, if it becomes embedded in bone.
And if it does not come out by itself, leave it for several days and then pull and move it again each day; it will eventually come out. If it still does not come out after some days, you should pierce around the arrow in the same bone from every direction with a fine needle to widen the passage for the arrow, then pull and extract it.
If the arrowhead is embedded in the skull and has penetrated one of the brain cavities, and some of the symptoms mentioned to you have appeared from below, then refrain from pulling out the arrow and leave it until its condition becomes clear after a few days.
If it is necessary to draw out and remove the arrow, if the arrowhead is firmly embedded and does not respond to drawing, use probes around the arrow as described to you, then treat the area until it heals. If the arrowhead has withdrawn to a position in the body, And if it has lost sensation, probe it with a探针，如果感觉到箭头的存在，则使用适当的器械将其拔出。如果由于伤口狭小、箭头深入且位置较深，并无骨头、神经或血管，无法使用上述方法。
And if it has lost sensation, probe it with a probe until you enlarge the wound and can reach the arrow. If it has two ends, grasp them and cleanse the pus from all sides of each end with every means possible. If you cannot completely remove the pus by grasping the ends, break them and probe until you can extract it.
And if you attempt to remove the arrow in any position, use your forceps with all possible angles until you extract it. Be as gentle as possible to avoid breaking the arrow, which would make it difficult to draw out and remove. If you are unable to do so within your means, wait until you can.
Leave it for several days until that flesh around it putrefies, then attack him; if you encounter bleeding, use the treatment we mentioned in its chapter, and spare your effort from cutting vein or nerve or tendon and use巧代手法。
You should extract the arrow from every direction you can with kindness and patience as you described, and you should pull the arrow so that the patient returns to the condition he was in before the arrow struck him; this is more appropriate.
If you cannot do that, use whatever means are available. As for the arrow that comes out on the opposite side, either something protruded from it externally, or you will find the tip of the arrow by touch near the surface of the skin and recognize its direction.
Make an incision in him, and the size of the incision should be commensurate with what the tweezers can accommodate. Then pull it; this will make it easier for it to come out. If it gets stuck in a bone, grasp your hand around the roundness until the arrow affects the bone and widens for itself, then pull it.
Otherwise, leave it for several days until he attacks and comes to you again. If the arrow has broken inside him, push it out with your hand. If the shaft has fallen and you wish to use a probe, insert the hollow instrument into the wound, enter its cavity, then push the arrow out with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that can enter that cavity; the arrow will be easier to extract this way. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize the flesh in which all the poison has settled, if you can do so, then treat it accordingly.
If the arrow is found in the chest or in the abdomen or in the bladder or in the groin and it is close to what can be probed with a probe, and you are able to cut through it, then cut through it while being careful not to cut an artery or nerve, and extract it.
Then suture the wound if it needs suturing, and treat it until he is cured. Image of the hooks used to extract arrows:
Its ends are similar to bird beaks, made like forceps so that when they grasp the arrow or anything else, they do not leave it. They can be made in various sizes, large, small, and medium, all according to the size of the arrow and its width, as well as the breadth and narrowness of the wound.
Image of the evacuated cannon:
Image of the silenced trumpet:
This is a silenced tip like a mute, to facilitate its entry into the evacuated arrow and push it out.
Fifth Ninety-Chapter
In Treating Arteries.
Arteries that are commonly treated in the body number thirty. Sixteen of these are in the head: the two pulsating arteries behind the ears, known as the Hassasins, and the two arteries in the cheeks, which are prominent, and the two arteries in the area of the eyes, known as the Nozzardin.
And the artery that runs in the middle of the forehead, the artery that is at the tip of the nose, the two arteries in the cheeks, and the two arteries in the upper lip, and the two arteries in the lower lip. These are known as the Jihark. And the two arteries beneath the tongue.
As for the veins that divide in the arm and hand, they are five veins. One is the cephalic, which is from the beastly side, and the common people call it the head vein. The second is the median, which is composed of a branch of basilic and a branch from the cephalic, and the common people call it the body vein.
And the basilic, which is located on the human side and is also called the ulnar vein. The common people call it the abdominal vein. The radial vein, which is situated on the tendon and is the one that protrudes clearly above the thumb. The asilam.
And this is the vein between the middle finger and the ring finger, which has two branches. In the leg, there are three veins. One is below the patella from the beastly side, the second is the saphenous, located on the human side at the heel, and the third is the great saphenous vein, located on the beastly side at the heel.
And in the other leg, there are three veins similar to them. As for the two veins behind the ears, their division is beneficial for chronic and scrofulous diseases, and head wounds with persistent severe sores. The method of dividing them as I describe.
And this is done by shaving the back of the patient's neck and rubbing the area where the veins are located with a coarse cloth, rubbing it well. Then, tie the patient's neck with a scarf until the veins appear and their position becomes visible behind the ears in the lower parts of the head. Pinch them with your fingers and where you feel the pulse beneath your fingers, there mark them with a pen.
Then take a sharp forceps, which is known as the nashl. Insert it under the vein in the skin until the forceps reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the skin and flesh above and cut the vein along with the skin in a severed manner. The length of the cuts should be that of two clenched fingers.
Or in a similar manner, drain the amount of blood you desire. Then tie them with ligatures and leave them until they heal. This cutting and cauterizing was mentioned earlier in the beginning of the book. As for the arteries in the temples, their closure is beneficial for the chronic migraine, severe headaches, and constant conjunctivitis, as well as the excessive discharge of acute disorders affecting the eyes.
The method of closing them as I describe:绑紧患者的颈部头巾，直至静脉清晰可见于皮肤表面，并能明显感觉到其脉动在你手指之下。然后用墨水标记。接着用你的食指从静脉上方提起皮肤至其上方。
Then insert the nashl forceps from below and raise the vein above, severing it as you did with the other veins. Drain the blood to the extent you need. Then suffocate the patient and place your finger on the vein for a moment.
Then place a cloth and ligature over it, tie it tightly from above, and leave it until it heals. This cutting and tying of the frontal vein was mentioned earlier at the beginning of the book. As for the closure of the forehead vein, its benefit is after the clivus has been tied for chronic facial ailments such as hives, ulcers, and severe redness.
How to bind him in the manner I describe, you will choke the patient by wrapping a cloth around his neck until sweat appears, then take the instrument known as the axe; this is its shape:.
You place the pronged end at the same spot as the sweat and strike from above with a comb or something similar. Allow the blood to flow to the extent desired, then release the chokehold on the patient and tighten it until he recovers.
And it may be opened with a wide forceps, though it should not be that the forceps have a sharp point like other forceps; rather, it should have a slightly broad point. Bind it with ligature because the bone is close, and perhaps the forceps will break if it is too thin.
As for the veins in the angle of the eyes, their benefit is in treating ailments of the eye such as scabies, redness, and affections of the face. As for how to bind them, the patient should wrap his neck with a cloth. Then you should bind these veins while standing over his head, making sure the binding is slightly loose to length, using a small forceps that has a slightly broad point.
For the area has no flesh; if the forceps have a thin point, it may break. Then release the amount of blood you need, place a cotton pad over them, and bind them for one night. As for binding the nasal veins, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
For severe headaches and affections of the face such as the persistent red swelling that appears in the nose, how to bind it: the patient should wrap his neck. Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long forceps.
It is inserted into the middle of the urethra itself between the nasal partition for straightness, because urine does not appear to the sense there; but blood comes from it. You should use your hand with the forceps a little and expel your need of blood, then tie it overnight as it congeals quickly.
As for the wings, it is beneficial to cut them for difficulty of breathing and the onset of leprosy and black diseases that appear on the surface of the skin, such as black hives, scabs, and poor sores, and how to cut them that the physician ties beneath the wing in its neck with a bandage, and stands over the wing.
And the wing is seated on a chair, then cut the vein to the length with a wide but slight incision. Then bleed an adequate amount of blood or according to your need for that. Do the same with the other vein. Then remove the bandage.
And tie the veins moderately so that the wing does not suffocate and leave it until the next day, for it will heal the wound. As for the veins of jezik, it is beneficial to cut them after cutting qif. For they are useful for treating ulcers in the mouth, decay of the gums, poor sores, and splitting of the lips, as well as poor sores.
That which occurs in the nose and around it, and how to cut them that you seat the wing before you and tie its neck with a turban. Then turn its lips and look at the two veins; one is on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, distinguishing them by their blackness.
And this is also that the veins between them are thin and black; cut them into short pieces, and if it is unclear to you and you do not know what they are, then go to the larger and clearer cuts. Thus, do this with the two veins in the lower lip.
And as for the veins beneath the tongue, it is of benefit to cut them after cutting the qif for the khawaniq that occur in the throat from lheyha and mouth diseases, and the method of cutting them is to place the patient between your legs with the sunlight and raise the tongue and look under the tongue on one side for a vein and on the other side for a vein and direct their color towards black.
And cut them and be careful not to cut them deeply, for beneath them are arteries, and perhaps there may be a bleeding from those arteries. As for the three veins that are cut in the elbow, they are what is customary to cut in all people, and their cutting is done in two ways.
Either stitch them with a broad herbaceous forceps or a olive-wood forceps to the tissue, or incise them with a surgical knife forceps, which is the nishal [and this is its image]. The image of the broad herbaceous forceps:.
It is broad as you see, and it is suitable for opening the prominent, full, and obvious veins that contain thick, gelatinous blood. This is the image of the olive-wood forceps:.
This forceps is narrower and finer at the tip, and it is suitable for cutting the thin veins that contain thin, yellowish blood. This is the image of the nishal forceps:.
This incision which is suitable for cutting and is of various sizes, broad and narrow according to the size and narrowness of the veins. And this can be used as evidence for others. It is well-known among craftsmen.
As for the basilik, which is one of these three veins, its benefit in cutting it is that it draws blood from the illnesses that occur below the throat and neck, near the chest and abdomen. It is advisable for the cutter when cutting it to beware, and to be on its side because beneath it is a vein; if he errs and increases the depth of the forceps' pricks, he will cut that vein.
It results in bleeding; therefore, it is advisable that his cutting should not be with the forceps for piercing but rather with an incision using a scalpel. If the basilik does not appear clearly, you should avoid it and redirect to another vein or seek some of its branches.
Or cut in its place the basilic vein, for it is clear and you can puncture it with the scalpel as we said. If you want to cut it directly, it is advisable to examine the location by pulling on the arm until you identify the pulse point, then mark it with a needle.
Then tie the arm and puncture the vein with a lateral incision using the scalpel as we said, and take care that the strike is away from the position of the vein. When you see upon pulling the bandage a puff in the place you marked with the needle, this puff is an indication of the swelling of the vein; avoid it.
If you see the blood at the cut spurt like the urine of a boy and is thin and red, know that it is from the vein. Then act quickly, place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the blood stops, often it stops; pull on the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it. Let it be on his neck and do not move it for days until he recovers. If the bleeding does not stop and you are overcome and are not present when a remedy is available, then amputate the vein if it appears to you; its两端内容已经被截断，无法继续翻译。根据提供的指令，我将止步于已给出的文本末尾，不会添加任何注释或扩展。如果你有完整的原文需要翻译，请提供完整的内容。
Or take a piece of fig wood, split it, and take the half part and tie it tightly on the vein's site with the bandage and its reinforcements for another day. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, treat it as previously mentioned by placing the stopping pellets, and cut his blood, which is not difficult in most cases.
For the place of a small wound and the tightness of the bandage in the arm, know it. As for the basilic vein, its closing is beneficial because it draws blood from above the head and below the body to that place, as it is composed of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic, as we have said.
It is necessary for the one who closes it to do so on the neck where the closing occurs, for beneath it lies the nerve. If he increases with the sutures and injures the nerve, a numbness results that is difficult to detect, and it may never fully recover. This nerve often becomes apparent through touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is very fine, not easily visible, you should make the closure by splitting it with a scalpel. Avoid injuring the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, split the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, its closure is beneficial because it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and it should be particularly divided by a surgical forceps of olive wood or a broad culinary herb forceps; for it is safer to divide all the veins because there is no artery nor nerve beneath it.
But when dividing, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the forceps and seek the soft spot. It does not matter if it is not hit by the first strike; it may be divided again a few times. However, it might swell in some people if it is not divided in the first strike.
But this swelling does not harm it at all. As for the method of division and its complications, and what should be done in correcting it, the first thing you should know is that division is used solely for preserving health.
And it may be used for diseases, and what is used for preserving health and its continuity and preventing the occurrence of diseases should be division in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, basilic, and brachial, and should be performed at the beginning of spring if signs of swelling appear.
And the division should be performed on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours have passed since dawn. As for the division used for diseases, it is not limited to a specific time; it can be done at night or during the day whenever necessity dictates.
And it should be performed at any hour and at any time. It is not advisable to divide the veins in children until they reach fourteen years of age, nor in elderly people who have surpassed sixty years. If anyone decides to perform division for any reason.
It is necessary to cleanse his intestines before the operation with a gentle enema if there is much retained filth, lest it be drawn into the veins upon cutting the intestine, causing putrefaction that harms the principal organs. He who is swollen, drunk, or intoxicated should not be operated on until such conditions are removed from him.
He should also beware of the operation after passing urine or vomiting or defecation, or after excessive coitus, fatigue, exercise, watching or staying up late, fasting, and all that weakens either bodily or spiritual strength, then consider softening the veins if the blood is thick.
By means of foods, drinks, and medicines if that is possible, then he should enter the bath if there be no preventer or he should engage in some exercise to soften the blood, making his operation in the middle of the day as we said. He should strive to rid himself of all bad spiritual symptoms that day.
As for worries, anger, fear, and all physical symptoms such as fatigue, excessive exertion, coitus, and the like, let his mind be prepared with the things to which people are accustomed, such as perfumes, fragrant herbs, entertainments, and the like, each person according to what he can manage.
Then the patient should sit on a pillow that is higher than the pillow upon which the operator sits. The operator should then stretch out his arm and gently rub it twice or three times with his hand. Then he should tie the bandage with the straps, looping it twice or three times, ensuring that the tension is moderate.
For if the tension is not moderate, whether by过度紧张导致压迫过重而阻碍血液循环，或是放松过度同样也会阻断血液循环。然后应让被操作者双手互相摩擦以促进血液循环。
Until the veins swell and become evident to touch. Then, rub the incised forceps gently with old olive oil. Then place his fourth finger of the left hand under the same vein below the location he intends to cauterize slightly so that the vein does not shift and avoid the strike. Because some veins are like strings that shift when cauterized, and others are filled with air; when placed under the forceps, they may retract beneath the forceps and deceive the surgeon so that the forceps do not open the vein. If they do open, it will only be a narrow opening.
Therefore, the surgeon must be cautious and deliberate in all these matters. Then he should place the forceps; if the vein opens on the first attempt, it is good. Otherwise, he should try again slightly below or above that location with urgency if the area does not become swollen.
If the swelling or pain increases, leave it for one or two days and do not tighten the bandage, as it might cause a hot abscess. Do not enter the bathhouse either. Then he should attempt cauterization again if he desires, provided that the forceps are inserted and the opening is small with thin blood flow.
And fear that the amount of blood you want to extract may not be sufficient. Redo the cauterization in the same hole, being gentle on the straightness and slightly increase the opening. Do this urgently before the area swells, as often the area can swell when the opening is small.
And if you see that it has swollen, do not redo it at all; it will not help you. Place something from old olive oil on it, as it facilitates the flow of blood and is better in this location than olive oil itself or any other ointment.
Use oily ointment in all cases of lacerations of the veins when the blood will not flow. And the victorious remedy and shakhanaya's instrument may do this if placed on the place; then the blood thins and dissolves if it is thick.
If a swelling occurs in the laceration and is large, it often happens, especially to one who has not lanced it but this time or if the opening of the vein is small, then act quickly. Place a sponge soaked in warm salt water on the swelling and hold it for a while; it will dissolve.
You should do this after the blood has fully flowed out from the vein itself or from another vein. If anything remains in the place after days, such as blackness or greenishness, it will not harm. If you wish, apply something of the mixture of patience and dissolved bitter substance.
Or something of the juice of fustic and similar substances. Often a swelling and hardness occur in lacerations of the basilicus vein; place your hand on it. If you find it yields when you press on it, then this is bad hardness. Be careful not to apply anything of what we have mentioned to it.
If it has bled from a vein, however, compress it with what is inside to harden the place, then treat it with other treatments until it heals. It is best that each person bleed according to their strength and the dominant color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it bleed until it turns red. And if you see that it is thick, cause it to thin out. Similarly, if it is sharp, allow its sharpness to go away. It is best for one who is full and strong and needs to bleed all at once.
He should widen by separating the vein, and the forceps should be wide. If he is weak, do the opposite of that. It ought to be extracted in stages, and the hole should be narrow. The best used for separating the vein should be curved, rough, cut, not threaded.
This kind of separation is free from bleeding and nerve cutting, and it is better and safer than wide and long separation. If one is accustomed to passing out during separation, it ought to be fed something of soaked watermelon rind or jellyfish before separation.
If it is heated and he has bled him three or four times, if the temperament is cold, let him take before separation bread soaked in mubayyeh drink or in sweet honey drink flavored with fawiya or in a fragrant drink.
If fainting occurs during separation and its cause is the heavy bleeding, he should be given meat water and a fragrant thin drink. Use expensive seasoning for fumigation and rub his chest with it. Use all that we have mentioned concerning division in the chapter on fainting.
That which results from vomiting, as for those who wish to relax their arm and release their blood again, it ought to be done gradually by releasing a little blood each day for several consecutive days for one whose strength is weak and whose separation is for much vomiting.
As for those who wish to relax their arm and release their blood again, and whose bodies are strong, they should do this over seven or nine hours of their first separation. As for those who wish to draw the blood from their body to the opposite side of where it has gathered, it ought to be done on the second or third day.
And as for him in whose body the blood is much and has become heated and caused a fever, it should be that the blood is drawn from him in one single instance and the large quantity should be removed and the opening should be enlarged to the point where unconsciousness becomes apparent after observing all conditions of phlebotomy. And you should place your hand on his pulse when the blood is flowing to prevent death occurring instead of unconsciousness, for this often happens if the phlebotomist is unaware and becomes negligent. It should not be done if you wish to release the arm and allow the blood to flow a second time.
And since the sweat pore is closed and the flow of blood is difficult, do not prick it forcefully or twist it strongly, for this is very bad. Either leave it until it is phlebotomized again, or use a surgical forceps to dislodge what has congealed in the sweat pore.
Or hold something of the salt that has dissolved in water against it, or hold something of the Farouq emetic or shakhnaya and prick it gently until the blood flows. If the sweat pore has become swollen, leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If the necessity demands that the blood be released a second time and there is no choice, either phlebotomize above that place, or on the other arm, or on the other sweat pore.
And as for phlebotomy of the arm's vein, it should be phlebotomized instead of aculect and basilicus if they are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of them. The method of phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the pulse becomes red and the sweat pore becomes clearly apparent, then a moderate tension is applied above it with a bandage.
Then divide the vein slightly off the width and length, let the opening be wide, and place your clamp above the wrist joint slightly. If the blood does not come out, reimmerse the hand in hot water and let the blood flow in the water.
Until your need is met, if you are in the days of summer, you may suffice without reimmersement of the hand in hot water. More often does blood flow in hot water during winter time, and clamping this vein is safer than all other veins. Because there is no vein or nerve dangerous beneath it. As for clamping the basilica of the right hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the liver. The method of clamping it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after you immerse the hand in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no vein or nerve dangerous beneath it. As for clamping the basilica of the right hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the liver. The method of clamping it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after you immerse the hand in hot water until the vein swells. It is evident by touch. Then divide it slightly off the width, and even if you amputate it entirely, it will not harm him. Be careful not to insert your hand deeply with the forceps, for there is a nerve of the fingers beneath it, and the area is stripped of flesh. Then reimmerse the hand in hot water.
Let the blood flow in it, for if you do not reimmerse it in hot water, the blood will congeal in the vein's opening and not flow. If you remove the excess blood to meet your need, put grease and salt on the vein to prevent it from closing quickly.
Similarly, you should do this with every narrow branch. As for the benefit of clamping the basilica of the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the liver. Do it in the same way as you did with the second one. As for clamping the safinah, its benefit is for ailments in the lower parts of the body, such as women's complaints.
Retention of menstruation and diseases of the kidneys and chronic sores of the thighs and legs and similar diseases, and the method of treating them: he should put his leg in hot water and apply massage until the vessels drain, then tie it above the knee joint with bandages and compresses, their place being at the heel, on the surface near the toes.
And from this, many branches arise in the sole of the foot. Therefore, bind it on the wider branch or at the heel where the toes meet; this is better and safer. If you bind it on the sole of the foot, you will protect the nerves beneath it on the sole of the foot.
And make your binding such that it appears you intend to amputate, with the clamp as a mere precaution. If the blood does not come out, reimmerse his leg in hot water and let the blood flow until it is exhausted. If the binder mistakes the vessel during the first attempt at binding.
And bind again slightly above, for the place is safe and there is no fear of injury to the vessel if it is protected as we said. Do the same with the other foot. As for the nerve of the woman, its place, as we said, is at the heel on the inner side.
And the benefit of binding it for pain in the hip if that is due to hot blood, and the method of binding: immerse the affected limb in hot water and rush to bind his leg from the hip to above the heel with four fingers using a thin long cloth; otherwise, it will not be noticeable.
And if it becomes noticeable, bind it in any case. Either leave it on as a precaution, which is better, or amputate it by cutting or incise it. Its place is safe and is very hidden in most people; if you do not find it.
Lack of sensation in part of the branches thereof, and it appears on the back of the foot near the middle phalanx and the ring finger, preserving some of the nerves and sending forth the quantity of blood that you desire.
Then apply the tension and place a cloth at the site of the fasad. Tighten the area, for it will quickly heal.
The Sixty-Ninth Chapter.
On Cupping and Its Usage.
The cups may be made of horns, wood, brass, or glass. Cupping can be performed in two ways: one is cupping with a jar and extracting blood, and the other is cupping without a jar.
And this cupping without a jar can be performed in two ways.
Cupping of the submaxillary regions, which are the sides of the neck, and cupping of the chin, which is under the lower jaw. Cupping of the shoulders, cupping of the sternum, which is at the base of the throat, and cupping of the elbows, which are in the middle of the upper arms, and cupping of the legs, and cupping of the knees.
Cupping draws blood from the fine vessels scattered in the flesh. Therefore, it does not weaken the strength as much as cupping for a fasad. Cupping should not be used with fire or without fire in any condition caused by excess until the body expels all of it.
If the need arose for cupping in illness or by custom, we used it at any time in the beginning of the month and at the end of it and in the middle of it and at whatever time it was.
And this is because some people, when there is an excess of blood in them to the extent that it needs to be removed by cupping, find a heaviness and headache in their head. Some find swelling and redness in their face, head, and neck. Some find itching on their face and armpits, as well as dimness and soreness in their eyes. Some scratch the place where they were cupped.
And some find an increased tendency to laugh. Some find the taste of blood in their mouth and vomit blood. Some sleep more than usual. Some see during their dreams blood, swelling, soreness, and wounds, and things like that. Whenever we saw any of these.
And especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we ordered cupping after two or three hours had passed from noon. As for the benefit of cupping on the nasa'ah point, it benefits from heaviness in the head and a fluid that flows to the eyes.
But it should be done after the body has fully expelled its contents. This cupping can be a substitute for bleeding the qiffal. It is warned that it should not be used by those with cold brains or those who have a fever, as it can cause great harm to them.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly and those with cold head ailments, as well as those who have frequently used it, as it has caused them to forget.
Therefore, it should be ordered that the cupper lower his hand with the cup slightly downwards to avoid causing forgetfulness. As for cupping the shoulder, it is a substitute for bleeding the acromion and basilicus veins.
Therefore, it is effective for asthma, shortness of breath, collapse of the respiratory apparatus, coughing, and congestion. It is necessary to slightly raise cupping on the scapula, for if it is directed downwards, it produces weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping on the cheeks, it is effective for acute headaches in the head, conjunctivitis, malaria, suffocation, and pain in the roots of the teeth. It is a substitute for basilic vein bloodletting. It is necessary to instruct the cupper not to deepen his hand with the suction to avoid cutting a vessel and causing bleeding.
As for cupping under the cheekbones, it is effective for abscesses in the mouth and gum decay and similar diseases of the mouth. It can serve as a substitute for bloodletting of the jaws located in the lips. As for cupping on the shoulders, it is effective for suffocation that results from congestion and heat.
As for cupping on the subclavian region, it is effective for what is effective in bloodletting of the three major veins: the basilic, internal jugular, and external jugular, because it draws blood from all those thin veins within the flesh and draws those thin veins from thicker veins until the suction reaches the three thick veins.
It is necessary to instruct the cupper not to apply the suction too deeply, for the area is bare of flesh and has nerves and vessels underneath. As for single cupping on the scapula, it is effective for hemorrhoids and wounds in the lower region.
It is necessary to instruct the cupper to use a large cup and one made of brass, for the area requires strong suction, and sometimes a glass cup may break and apply too much pressure. As for cups used on the legs, they reduce congestion noticeably.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and benefits from chronic pains in the kidneys, wombs, and bladders, and induces menstruation and benefits from pimples and bruises, and serves the place of cupping the spines and ribs except that it exhausts the body greatly and causes dizziness in most people, and the decanters of the ribs' cups have their benefit close to the benefit of cupping the legs.
The method of placing the decanter is to first place the cup empty and suck moderately. Do not prolong the placement of the decanter but put it on quickly and remove it quickly to receive the mixtures evenly. You should repeat this and continue until you see the area turn red and open up.
The blood turns red. Then you should prick and suck gradually. Afterwards, observe the condition of the bodies. If someone has soft flesh with open pores, it is advisable to prick him once only, lest the area become inflamed.
You should direct the cupper to widen the incision, deepen it slightly, and perform the sucking gently with a delicate movement. If the blood is thick, he should prick twice; in the first time, to open a path for the clear and watery part of the blood, and in the second time, to draw out the thick blood.
If the blood is extremely thick, he should prick again a third time to reach the desired level. In summary, if we wish to draw out only a little blood, one incision will suffice; if we wish to draw out much blood, we should make a larger incision. If we determine that the blood is thick, we should follow the appropriate procedure accordingly.
We must stipulate a deep condition and the moderate limit in the condition is only the depth of the skin. What should not be used from ointments when placing the cups and from water, and what the cupped should beware of, as for those whose skin is thick, hard, and tight with narrow pores.
You should apply ointments softening and opening to the areas where the cups will be placed, unless it is in the summer time, then you may use ointment of safflower or balsam or sweet almond ointment or pumpkin seed ointment.
And in the winter, you may use ointment of narcissus or violets or marigold or lilies and similar. If the phlegm is thick and cold, then use ointment of marjoram or nammam or bane or shibth and similar.
If the cupped person has wide pores and loose flesh, it should be avoided to use ointments. These should be washed with rose water or cold water or grape hyacinth water or pumpkin water or dianthus water and similar. As for those whose blood is much wet.
He should wash his cups with vinegar or mint water or similar. As for those whose phlegm is thick, he should wash his cups with old wine or marjoram water or boiled shibth or marigold and similar. It is advisable to avoid cupping in a bathhouse or shortly after a bath.
But it should be used after leaving the bathhouse for an hour or two. It should not be allowed for anyone to sleep after cupping, and proper arrangements should be made by both the cupped person and the therapist before and after cupping.
You should first examine whether the leecher or bloodletter is sanguineous, and if his blood is generally sharp and inflammatory; in which case, he should take the remedies like pomegranate and colocynth with vinegar, lettuce and cardamom and similar ones. His food should be lentils and sheep's meat as well as barley and similar items.
And if his temperament is cold, he should be given honey drink or colocynth decoction or essence. He should take moderate perfumed wine that lies between the old and the new. He should be ordered to eat less, with food consisting of lentils, fava beans, pigeons, and domestic fowl as barley. The drink should be more than the food on the day of bloodletting and blood extraction.
And it should be given at some times to some people of the terryq al-Farouq or musk medicine or sibilatha before bloodletting and before blood extraction or after them, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood. It should not be administered to those who have recently had bloodletting.
As for the bloodletting without a condition, it is the bloodletting placed on the liver and spleen and the breasts, and on the abdomen and groin, and the kidney area and the sides of the hips, because these organs cannot tolerate a condition on them. Rather, it is intended either to draw the blood from one organ to another.
As we place the leech on the breasts in a case of hemoptysis, or we use it to release wind with cold vapor from bloodletting in an organ. For example, we place the leech on the abdomen and groin, as this agitates the organ, warms it, and relieves pain through the dispersion of that cold vapor.
And it is placed on the kidney if a clot or stone is present, for by the strength of its suction, perhaps it may open the clot or dislodge the stone from its place. Similarly, it acts when placed on the liver and spleen during an attack that affects them; these probes can be used empty only by suction.
And it may be used with fire and may be filled with lukewarm water for cases of scalding. This is done by filling the probe with hot water alone or with water that has been boiled with some herbs suitable for such conditions.
And it is placed filled with water at the affected area, held and removed, and repeated as needed. This is a depiction of the probe used with fire.
Its mouth has the capacity of two open fingers as depicted, and its depth is about half a span. On one side, there is a small hole of about the size that an needle can enter. It is made from Chinese copper or yellow brass with thick edges.
Smooth and level, coated to prevent it from injuring the organ when placed on it. In its middle, there is a slit made of copper or iron through which the candle can be inserted when used with fire. This probe can be made larger than described or smaller according to the illness.
And its method of use is that the probes for boys and eunuchs are different from those for men. As for placing this probe with fire on the organ, it is done by lighting a wick from tightly woven cotton or a small candle, and placing it in the middle of the hardened member located in the center of the probe.
Let the fire rise upwards towards the bottom of the suction cup so as not to burn the patient's body, then place it on the part and have the finger on the hole we mentioned until we grasp the suction cup; then we remove the finger.
The vapor came out through that hole and the suction cup loosened on the site. Then the wick is placed as described and returned if needed. As for the suction cup used for water blisters, it does not have a stiff rod nor a hole.
It is used by filling it with water and placing it only on the part. This is its image:.
This suction cup should be large to hold much water; the larger it is, the better.
Seventh and Ninety-Second Section.
On Treating Boils.
Boils are used most often in parts of the body where it is impossible to place the suction cups either because they are too small, such as the lips and palate, or because the part is bare of flesh, such as the fingers and nose.
The method of using it is to select a boil that is in fresh, pure water free from impurities. Then leave it in fresh water for a day and night until it becomes hungry and there is nothing left in its cavity. Then the patient should first induce vomiting by emesis or by cupping, and then the healthy part should be wiped.
Until it becomes red, then place the suction cup on it. If it fills up and falls off, that is better for its benefit. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with much water, and rub and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the boil falls off, and this is a hemorrhage, soak a cloth in cold water and apply it.
And place it from above until the effusion stops. If the blood flows in excess, sprinkle on it a thick powder or ointment or something similar from clamps until the blood stops or place on the place half-beanshell peeled.
And leave it until the beanshell adheres to the place; then the blood will stop. It is necessary that if reapplication is needed, do not reapply that dressing if possible with another, and if dressing cannot adhere, then wipe the place with fresh blood.
Or insert a needle into the place until it extracts some blood, then place it. If it feels anything of blood, it will adhere to the spot. If you wish to remove it, sprinkle something of acrid powder or salt or ashes on it; it will fall off from the spot.
The Third Chapter.
In the Jawb (abscess).
This chapter also belongs to the artifice needed in the craft of medicine, which is the treatment of fractures and dislocations in bones.
Know, O my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people. Those who have never studied the works of the ancients in it or read a single word from them.
And for this reason, this art has become non-existent in our land. Indeed, I have never come across anyone who was satisfactory in it at all. And I have derived from it only what I derived through extensive reading of the works of the ancients and my earnest desire to understand them, until I extracted the knowledge of that from them. Then I adhered to experimentation and practice throughout my life.
And I have outlined to you from this in its entirety what my science encompasses. And I have tried it through my experience after bringing it to you, refining it from the trappings of prolixity and condensing it to the utmost brevity, elucidating it to the greatest extent of clarity, and illustrating therein many images of the machines used in it.
And it is for the increase in clarity, as I did in the preceding two chapters. And there is no strength except in Allah, the Most High, the Greatest.
The First Chapter.
It is advisable to summarize and condense matters concerning the breaking of bones, and to present them before we begin to mention each broken and dislocated part individually. It should be necessary to include in the beginning of this chapter some statements and sections. It will first compel you and anyone else who is eager to learn this noble art to understand them and grasp their reality.
I say that whenever a person suffers a break, dislocation, inflammation, or fall, one should first hasten to reduce it, evacuate it, or treat both conditions. If there is no obstacle preventing this, such as weakness of strength or if the incident occurred to a child, an old man who is feeble-minded, or if the time is extremely hot or cold.
Then his diet should be limited to cool pulses and bird meat and broth. He should avoid heavy foods and overeating, and any food that fills the veins with blood. Until swelling is secured and you do not expect a discharge to the area.
When then the patient returns to his first regimen which was customary for him, if the broken bone is in the process of setting it should be nourished with foods that are rich, thick, and strong, containing gelatine like lentils, rice, heads, camels' hump, and calves' heads. And eggs, tender fish, thick drinks, and the like, for by this regimen the healing of the fracture is faster and better. Know that broken bones in strong men and old men cannot ever connect and fuse back to their original state.
Due to the dryness of their bones and their hardness, what was extremely flexible in the bones can connect and fuse like the bones of young children. However, nature grows on all sides of the broken bone something similar to glue, making it hard, adhering, and drawing it together until it binds with itself.
It binds with itself until it attains the utmost strength and firmness as it was originally, so that nothing in his actions hinders him.
For this reason, the patient's diet should consist of foods that are strong, sticky, and hard, as we have said. Know that fractures can differ according to the type of bone involved, for a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the chest is different from a fracture of the spine.
Similarly, all other organs differ from one another. We will describe each type of fracture in detail in its own section, differentiated from others. Moreover, the fracture of a bone itself can also vary in different ways.
Because it may be a fracture due to a contusion without fragments occurring, and it may be a fracture along the bone with fragments and displaced pieces, whether completely or partially, and it may be a fracture with wound and breach in the skin, and it may be a slight crack.
And each type has a special method for setting it, as will be detailed in its place. As for the signs of bone fracture, they are its bending, displacement, and palpability, as well as its tremor when you touch it with your hand.
And if there is no obvious bending, tremor, or sensitivity in the area, and the bone does not show much disturbance upon palpation, and the patient experiences little pain, then there is no fracture. It could be a sprain or a slight fracture or a minor crack, so it should not be moved at all by stretching or probing.
But apply to it the medications that will be mentioned later as appropriate for the area. Then, tie it gently. Know that if the bone separates and pierces through two points without any fragments occurring, except that each part has separated from its counterpart.
But you should not hastily attempt to correct and align it before it develops a hot swelling. If it does develop a hot swelling, leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides. Then, adjust and align it gently using any means at your disposal that are gentle and skillful.
Know that setting and aligning it is easier when there are no fragments in the bone. Then, tie up as will be mentioned. If the bone has fragments, it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides whether by hand or foot.
Either by hand if the member is small, or with threads, or with thread and hand. Let the position of your member be on a level place in its natural shape until if the extended part of the broken bone reaches there; then return those excesses to their places by every means you can manage of巧思和温柔。
Strive to avoid causing further injury with your actions and do not bring pain or swelling. Strive to join one bone to its fellow in the best possible alignment. At that time, you should feel and examine them with your hand. If you see anything out of place, correct it and straighten it as well as you can.
Be careful to avoid excessive stretching and strong probing, as many of the ignorant often do. They frequently cause severe swelling or prolonged pain in the member through their actions, as you have seen this happen repeatedly.
Then, after the correction and perfection of the tension, keep that member at rest and allow it to heal. Warn the patient not to move it during both wakefulness and sleep, and when turning or disturbing himself, and during defecation and all his movements as much as he can. He should take care to position the member in a way that ensures safety from pain.
And this is because if the patient feels pain or discomfort in the position he has placed the member, he should shift it to another position where he does not feel pain. He should also ensure that this new position is level and straight.
Lest there be an awkwardness in the member if it breaks and heals straight. As for the way of tensioning the broken member, it is as I have described to you. Know that broken members differ in their size, shape, and form; some being small like the arm, finger, and thigh, and similar parts.
It is necessary that the bandages for injuries be soft and gentle, and those of the thigh, back, and chest should be broad and solid, as the wide ligament must bind the large member equally from all sides without any imbalance.
Then you begin to apply the appropriate paint after completing the smoothing. In applying gentle pressure to the break, then you begin to wrap the ligament around the break itself three or four times depending on what the member requires, and you gently tighten the ligament with your hand. Then you bring it to the upper part of the break position.
With less tension than you use for the broken area, then you wrap a bit away from the break and gradually relax the tension until you get a suitable position. Then you take another bandage and wrap it also around the broken area.
Wrap several times, then bring the wrap to the lower part of the break. Your action in tightening and relaxing the wrap should follow what we have mentioned for the first upper wrap. Then place between the bandages some soft pressure or padding to straighten out the break.
If there is a curvature, then put something to correct it. If not, do not place anything. Then wrap it with another bandage and apply the tight splints from your hand if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the member.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply what alleviates that inflammation and relieves the swelling. Leave it for a few days, then tighten the splints when doing so. The splints should be made of carved and prepared halves of broad bamboo rods, or they can be made of willow wood.
which is made from pine or palm leaves or rush or reed and whatever is available of such materials, let the size of each bandage be like this shape and form.
Except that the bandage which is placed on the fracture itself should be wider and slightly thicker than the other bandages. As for the length of the bandage, it should be made according to what is suitable for the broken limb in terms of its size, whether large or small. The shape of the bandage:
Then tie the bandages with another wrap according to your initial tightness. Afterwards, tie it from above with tight threads as we have mentioned, which is that your tightening should be more at the site of the fracture. The tighter the binding should be the closer it is to the fracture.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and softness. They should be made of wet cotton thread, especially, because if the threads are too thick like what you have seen from the actions of the ignorant, they make their threads from rolled cotton fabric, which is a great mistake.
Because it causes the binding to be too tight,偏离中庸；而太薄的线也不合适，因为你无法通过它达到所需的紧度。相邻的绷带之间不应少于一个手指的宽度。
If the patient is affected by the edges of the bandages after tight binding in the correct places, place underneath them something soft like cotton or fluffy wool so that nothing from it affects him. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and there is a tear in the skin, we will discuss it separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be set with splints from the first day. For when the limb is large, it should not be placed on splints except after five days or seven or more, according to your safety from the occurrence of the hot swelling.
This is the characteristic of the bandages that were used to immobilize the initial injuries, such as fractures, jaws, and thighs. It is a general brief bandage that sets the fracture and suits most conditions, especially children and women, because it does not predominantly have heat or cold.
Take the dust from the grain mill, which is the fine flour that sticks to the walls of the mill when the grinding is done. Knead it as it is without sieving it with egg white, making the paste neither too thick nor too thin. Then apply it.
The characteristic of another bandage that sets fractures, dislocations, and thighs: Take from the maash, ladan, aqiqya, rasn, mghath, and saqq, each eleven dirhams. From the murra and sabur, five dirhams each. From athl, twenty dirhams. And from Armenian or Roman clay, twenty dirhams. Grind all the ingredients and mix them with water of athl or with egg white if the patient's condition is feverish. Then use this bandage, for it is well-compounded, sets broken bones quickly, and suits most people due to its moderation.
The characteristic of another bandage that is also useful for fractures and thighs: Take mghath, maash, and white khattami from each eleven dirhams. Take murra and sabur from each five dirhams. Take aqiqya six dirhams and Armenian clay twenty dirhams. Grind all the ingredients finely, sieve them, and mix with water or egg white. Then use it.
Description of a dressing for dislocated joints and bones and to alleviate pain associated with them, fractures, and bone displacement. Take the purified wool and soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, then place it on the area. This dressing does not have the power of reduction.
But it is superior in alleviating the hot swelling and repelling pain specifically. Description of another dressing to reduce a fracture, take the bark of the deaf vine and the wild licorice leaf, crush them both together, and apply with a wet cloth. Description of another brief dressing used when a fracture dislocation occurs.
To resolve the remaining swelling, take one part of saffron, one part of chamomile, and one part of madder. Crush all together and mix with paint if the limb is not swollen; if it is swollen, mix it with fenugreek water or water. Use it accordingly.
Description of another stronger dressing for resolving hard swelling when a fracture dislocates, take one part each of saffron, cottonseed, fennel, crown flower, marigold, madder, and chamomile.
Crush all together and mix with water of conflict, or fresh water, or paint, according to the heat of the limb and the quieting of its fever. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be applied to the broken limb during reduction.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil, nothing else. It should be moderate between hardness and softness. As for Galen, he believed that things with dryness should be applied to the broken limb during reduction, such as bitter substances, patience, frankincense, and similar materials as mentioned.
Character of a Plaster Good for Weakness and Pain, One takes Musk and Cinnamon and Human Bald or Bird Feather and Cuttlefish Bone and Salt of Equal Parts, They Are Ground and Winnowed and Mixed and Applied with It, As for the Measure That the Bandage Should Remain.
Then It Is Dissolved, For One Should Look, and If No Pain or Itchiness or Displacement of the Broken Bone From Its Place Occurs, Do Not Dissolve It for Many Days, For If It Happens in the Place Itching Severe or Pain Anxious or Swelling.
Hasten to Dissolve It at the Right Time and Do Not Delay This in Any Way, Removing the Plaster. Then Take a Soft Cloth or Sponge of Sea Sponge Wet It in Warm Water Wash the Area With It Until the Itching Subsides and the Pain Alleviates. Then Allow the Part to Rest for a While.
Then Place Thereon Softened Cotton Soaked in Vinegar and Oil or Rose Anointing Oil, and Bind It Thereewith for One Night Until You Fear No Hot Swelling And Alleviates the Swelling and Alleviates the Pain. Then Return It to Gentle Tying and a Light Plaster But Do Not Bind It As Tight As Initially.
And Attend to It Until It Heals. If You See That the Swelling, Redness, Pain, and Swelling Have Gone Completely and You Need a Plaster and Tight Binding Restore It as You Did Initially, For If Nothing We Mentioned Occurs in the Part.
Do Not Dissolve It Except After Three or Four or Five or Seven Days, and It May Be Left for Twenty Days. All of This Depends on How the Part Appears to You, as We Have Said, Until the Fracture Remains and the Flesh近处的伤口接近愈合。
Increase the tension more than your first tension altogether. Also increase the severity of the food for the sick person more than what was mentioned before, for if you see that the fracture site has dried up and become softer than it should, know that the food is not reaching it.
Dilute it with fresh water every time you prepare it and let this be done every three days. Lightly decrease the tension; by this action, the food will reach the organ and heal quickly. As for what the ignorant ones do, who force the break again on the organ, it is incorrect.
If it does not heal properly at first and heals with a deformity instead, this is an error in their action and a great deceit. If it were correct, they would have mentioned it first in their books and acted upon it. And I have never seen any of them leave any trace of doing so at all. The correct action is not to perform it.
Chapter Two.
On the Fracture of the Head.
The types of fractures in the head are many, and their forms vary. The causes are diverse. Some fractures occur due to a sword strike and may involve the entire bone, extending down to the table beneath the bone. as is done in splitting wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a "qadumiyya." It may involve the cutting of the sword through part of the bone and only abrading its surface without penetrating to the end. This type of fracture is also called a "qaul" or complete cut. The wound from these two fractures may be either large or small.
And some fractures are brittle or crushed and their cause is a blow with a stone or falling on a stone or the like. This fracture may be penetrating and nearly reaches the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be in the face of the bone.
And the wound of these fractures may also be either large or small. Some fractures are hidden in the bone in the soft hair and are a slight depression.
And therefore, this type of fracture is called "sha'ri" (hair). Such a fracture may occur due to falling or striking with a stone and the like, where the bone page enters inward, causing depression in the area, similar to how brass would凹陷 if struck and part of it enters inward.
And this is more common in the wet bones of the head, such as the skulls of boys. Such fractures may have detached or undetached fragments, and we will mention the treatment of all these types in their respective places. We will recognize all these types of fractures by examining them.
And examine it with probes, and remove the rotten flesh from them. As for the hair fracture, it is recognized by examining the bone, wiping it, and applying ink to it; the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of the fracture, first consider the symptoms of the patient.
If you see in its symptoms clear indications of fear, such as bitter vomiting, stretching, loss of consciousness, fainting, high fever, dim and red eyes, and other similar symptoms, do not treat the patient or approach him; for death is certain to occur in most cases when accompanied by these symptoms.
And if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his safety, then begin his treatment. This is when the wounded one comes to you in the first instance of injury and this was during days of winter.
It is advisable to strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case, and if it is during the days of summer, it is advisable to hasten the removal of the bone before the seventh day, lest what is below the bone from the membrane become spoiled; exposing those symptoms which we have described.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is also comminution and softening, it is advisable to amputate the comminuted and softened part as I have described to you, which is to shave the head of the wounded patient.
And expose the bone in any way that is feasible for you and according to the shape of the wound and what is visible on the patient. If upon exposing the bone, you observe bleeding or a hot swelling, treat it as necessary.
And do this by stuffing the area with a soaked cloth in a mixture of wine and oil, and cleanse the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding is controlled. Then proceed with drilling the bone and removing it, which can be done in one of two ways.
As for the one way, it is to cut the bone with a gentle incision using a narrow blade. This is its form:.
Then use another incision after this one, slightly broader. This is its form:.
Then use another incision, also broader than the second. It is necessary for you to have a variety of blades, some broader and some shorter than others, with their edges in the utmost sharpness. They should be made of Indian steel or good steel.
Use kindness in striking the severed part lest the head be dislodged and hurt. If the bone is strong and hard, it should be drilled around before using the cutting forceps they named non-imbedding forceps. They should be called non-imbedding forceps.
Because it does not exceed the limit of the bone of the forehead to what is behind it, for the forceps has a round handle below its sharp head resembling a ring or small circle that prevents it from imbedding and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
You should take many of these forceps, each suitable for the thickness of that bone. Each forcep should be prepared to fit the size of the forehead, with its sharp end length and shortness according to the thickness of that forehead. This is a picture of three types. The forceps are large, medium, and small.
As for the method of drilling around the broken bone, you should place the forceps on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has given way. Then move the forceps to another position and make sure the distance between each drill is about the thickness of the marrow or something similar.
Then cut with the cutting forceps between each two drill holes and do this with as much kindness as you can, as we said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with some other instrument from among the tools you have prepared for this purpose.
For example, use the gentle forceps and clamps. You should be very careful that the forceps or cutter do not touch the dura mater. If you have reinforced the bone and it is free from the dura mater, and you have removed it, it should be stripped clean.
And to smooth the remaining roughness in the bone, use another instrument resembling the saw, except that it should be thinner and softer than other saws. If there is any small bones or碎片 remaining, take them with care using the instruments at your disposal.
Then treat the wound with sutures and ointments that will be mentioned. As for the other side of the work, it is a matter easy to determine and far from danger, about which Galen spoke and praised greatly. This is his saying. You should first begin by exposing the part of the bone in the area where the fracture is most severe and prominent. Once you have exposed that part, place the tip of this convex saw beneath it; this is its shape:.
The convex part of the saw should be smooth and not cut through anything, while the sharp part on its sides should extend in length as you see. This allows the convex part to rest against the table, and the sharp edge of the saw to contact the bone. Then strike the saw from one side.
With a small mallet until you cut through the entire bone with care, as it turns. You are safe from the membrane, and nothing terrifying will happen, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and胆怯的人，确实是这样，即使他是在睡觉。
If there is something adhering to the bone from the membrane in some parts of the bone, scrape it off with the tip of the convex saw itself, and remove it carefully. It can be removed without any pain or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone did not penetrate to the membrane, and what broke off from the bone was its end, and there remained roughness and fine碎片 in it, you should remove that roughness and extract those fragments with delicate probes that have been prepared in various sizes so that you can use the most suitable and appropriate one for each place as the work dictates.
The same bone and its shape, it is incumbent upon you to use in your inventory first the coarser instruments for the bone, then use after them finer ones. You must continue to do this with loyalty until you reach the use of its finest and most delicate ones.
As for other fine hairline fractures and gentle breaks, it is incumbent upon you to use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its correction, and this is something that does not escape him who has the slightest skill in this craft and has stopped by what we have written and explained regarding major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after extracting the bone, it is incumbent upon you to take a cotton cloth of the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil ointment. Place it over the opening of the wound, then take another cloth folded or triangular. Dip it in a mixture of juice and rose oil ointment, place it over the first cloth, and do this with the lightest material you can manage so as not to burden the dressing. Then use an宽腰带覆盖在上面，不要勒得太紧，只需足够紧以固定伤口。
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure of the subsidence of the hot swelling, then remove it and use instead the medicines that have a drying effect such as poppy roots, marshmallow powder, ground colocynth, and safflower, and the like. You should prepare these medicines as powders.
And apply it to the wound as a powder. In general, use a medicine that is purgative and not irritating. Strive to keep your treatment of the wound clean, avoiding any irritation from ointment, neither being too dirty nor too clean, and never allow pus to accumulate in it.
Because the pus, if it meets with the meningeal membrane, corrupts and putrefies it. Great debility results from this for the patient, and it may appear in the cerebral spinal fluid when the bone is revealed, especially if treatment is neglected.
Blackness on its surface, if observed and the patient exhibits the symptoms we have mentioned, know that it is hopeless without doubt. And if the blackness occurred due to a medicine placed thereon and was caused by the strength of that medicine, know that it does not signify hopelessness.
You should take a part of honey and three parts of rose fat, mix them well, apply them to a cloth, then place it on the cerebral spinal fluid. Then treat him with various treatments that are appropriate until he recovers.
The Third Chapter.
To reduce the nose if it is broken.
Know that the nose breaks only if its upper part, or one of them, fractures. This is because they are bones; the lower part is cartilaginous and does not break, but it may become swollen, crooked, or puffy.
If one of its halves fractures, you should insert a small finger into the nostril and straighten the fracture from inside with your middle finger and press it from outside to restore the nose to its natural shape. Do this gently and take care that you do not cause pain to the patient.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger did not reach it, you should straighten it with the tip of a splint that has a slight thickness. If the fracture is on both sides, do likewise. It should be reduced as soon as possible on the first day after the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot tumor is quiescent, then insert a cotton wick into the nasal aperture, one if the break was on one side or two if the break was on both sides.
Let the wick be thick enough to fill the nasal aperture. Some of the early restorers have mentioned that the wick should be soaked in oil and replaced each day. I do not see this as necessary; rather, it should be soaked in the white of an egg mixed with flour dust.
Then leave the wick until the bone has set and the cartilage is hardened. You may insert into the nose, in place of the wick, tubes made of goose feathers, wrapped with a soft linen to make it easier to hold due to the fracture of the nose, so that the patient does not find it difficult to breathe.
This is not essential; if you wish to make the wicks, or the tubes, you may do so. If a hot tumor arises in the nose during your work, dress the nose with cerate, or with cotton soaked in vinegar and oil or rose fat, or something from the ointment of diachylon.
If a hot tumor does not arise, it should be dressed externally with fine flour and pounded cornflower that has been mixed with the white of an egg. Then place a soft pad on top and do not bind the nose at all, for if the bones of the nose break in small fractures.
Or if it breaks, it should be incised and removed with the instrument suitable for this. Then suture the incision and treat it with a paste or ointment that will heal and seal the wound. If there is a wound inside the nose, it should be treated with a wick, and you should use copper tubes. Until he recovers.
The Fourth Chapter.
To set the lower beard roots that have broken.
If the lower beard roots have broken, and there is no wound, look to see if the break is only from the outside and does not fracture in two and turn inward. Its identification becomes easier.
If the break is in the right side, introduce the third finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the break is in the left side, introduce the third finger of the right hand and gently raise the bulge of the break from inside to outside.
With the other hand from outside the bone, control it to straighten it. If the jaw fracture has separated into two parts, it should be reduced using traction from both sides until it can be properly aligned. If it occurred in the teeth, they will grow back.
Or it may separate, so tighten what you hoped would remain with a thread of gold or silver or silk. Then place the copper splint on the broken beard roots, put a folded cloth on top, and cover it with a tight bandage or a piece of leather equal in length to the beard. Then tie it from above as you find convenient, arranging it to hold together without loosening. Order the patient to rest and remain calm, and give him soft food. If you think that anything has changed in its appearance at any point, loosen it on the third day and adjust it.
Then tie it from above as you find convenient, arranging it to hold together without loosening. Order the patient to rest and remain calm, and give him soft food. If you think that anything has changed in its appearance at any point, loosen it on the third day and adjust it. Then correct what you insert with flour of the grindstone with the white of the egg or with millet flour after removing the ceru slik from it and place upon the dressing a soft pad, so long as that dressing sticks to it and does not change in condition for the bone leave it.
Do not dissolve it until he is cured and the fracture becomes stronger, for this fracture often strengthens in three weeks. If a hot swelling appears during that period, use what we have mentioned repeatedly for soothing it until that swelling goes away.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then look to see if you have cleared the bone of碎片或碎片，要用器械小心取出，使其适合你的取出方式。如果伤口开口狭窄，则用镊子扩大其开口程度，以满足你的需要。
And when you have取出那些碎片后，如果伤口宽敞，则缝合其边缘；否则，涂上一种适合这种情况的药膏。 And plaster the wound until it heals.
Fifth Chapter.
In the Reduction of the Clavicle if Broken.
The clavicle is broken more frequently at the front, near the end of the sternum. Its fracture can occur in one of three ways: either it breaks and splits into two pieces without any fragments, which is the easiest to reduce.
Or the fracture may produce fragments, which is harder to reduce. Or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound. If the fracture is without a wound, prepare two attendants: one to hold the arm below the broken clavicle and the other to extend the neck towards the opposite side.
Then smooth the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be and there is no凹陷或扭曲。如果需要更深入，则应在患者腋下放置一个充气球或棉球。
And its bone should be as much as you need. Extend and lift the scapula, and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set as it should be. If you are not able to draw the end of the scapula outward because it has gone deep, then the patient should lie on his side.
A medium-sized pillow is placed under his shoulder. The pillow is pressed down on his shoulder until the deep scapula rises to the top. Then, correct the fracture and smooth it with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the scapula has broken and is moving, it should be incised and the fragment removed gently. If the fragment is embedded in the bone, you should try to cut it with one of the instruments prepared for this purpose. After the scapula has been stabilized with a clamp, which is made of wood or iron, this is its shape:.
It resembles a spoon with no handle. Its width should be according to the size of the bone, whether large or small. As for its length, it should also be suitable for the work you need to do. Let it have two ends, as you can see; one end is wider and the other is narrower.
If the wound from which you extracted the bone fragment is wide and there is no danger of a hot abscess, suture the wound's lips together. If the wound is minor or you fear a hot abscess, enlarge the wound by incising it and providing drains according to how much the wound was opened.
If a hot tumor is presented, apply the incision on ointment of rose and vinegar or drink and carry on. As for the tension of bone if it was without wound nor cut, then carry on with the bandage made from flour dust with egg white. You place the soft pad on it, then put the ball under his iliac region if needed. Then take a turban that is extremely long, with its width about a cubit or so, wrap the curved bandage around the pad and bandage, then take a splint from a thin board. Its width should be three fingers and the same for its length. Then insert it into a cloth, then place that cloth with the splint in the position on the turban that corresponds to the location of the fracture. Then tie the turban around the fracture as you wind it. Wrap it around his neck and under his healthy iliac region and his患病侧的髂部，然后每面都缠绕几圈，确保你认为拉紧可以牢固固定骨折。这对你来说是显而易见的。
Make sure that the splint does not come off from the broken bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient daily. Whenever you find that the bandage has relaxed and see that the splint has come off, correct this by tightening the bandage. Then make sure the patient sleeps on his back, and place a small pillow under his iliac region at night for support.
Lift it with it so that his shoulder rises above his side, and the fracture of the clavicle will rise with the elevation of the iliac region. Alternatively, tie his arm to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage unless there is a occurrence of itching or tumor in the area for twelve days.
Then renew the bandage if you see a reason for it. Respond to the tension and leave it until the clavicle heals and strengthens, and this becomes stronger and more robust over twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
To treat a dislocation of the shoulder. The shoulder rarely breaks at the wide part; it usually breaks at its parts. Whether it breaks at the edge or in the middle, this can be identified by touch. Treatment depends on the shape of the fracture.
Adjust it and return it to its natural shape using any means available. Then, apply a mixture of flour dust and egg white, and place a folded cloth pad on top. Finally, apply a wide bandage made from a board.
Make it as thin as the shoulder or a bit wider. If there is any swelling in any part of the shoulder under the bandage, gently treat that swelling with a soft pad until the bandage settles evenly. Then, tighten it from above with a long scarf.
Tighten it firmly and ensure the bandage stays in place, so it does not shift. Check the ligament daily; if the ligament relaxes, tighten it again and adjust the bandage if it has shifted. Let the patient lie on his sound side. The shoulder will heal in about twenty days.
One day or twenty-five days. If this period is completed and the ligament has healed, you are in safety, as these are bones that do not fear fragmentation or displacement. If a shard appears from the bone and causes irritation under the skin, incise it and extract it. Make what was mentioned regarding the treatment of clavicle fracture in soothing the hot swelling if anything of that kind occurs.
Seventh Chapter.
To correct a broken chest.
The chest may break in its middle, and that is rare. As for its edges, they are more likely to break and fracture. Among its symptoms, if the middle breaks, it will incline downwards and cause severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
Sometimes, it may bleed and the depression in the broken bone will be evident, not hidden from touch. To correct it, the patient should lie on his back with a cushion placed between his shoulders. Then, his elbows should be pressed, and the ribs gathered by the hands from both sides. Care should be taken to adjust them gently as much as possible on every side.
And adjust it until the shape of the bone returns to what is proper. Then, apply a dressing and pressure, and place over it a splint made from a strip of parchment or similar light material, wrapped in a cloth. And gently secure it around the broken bone so that it does not move. Pass the bandage around in a circular motion towards the back several times, tightening it firmly. Always check the bandage regularly, and tighten it whenever it relaxes.
And if necessity demands that it be loosened due to hunger or pain or swelling in the area, loosen it promptly. Remove the dressing and remedy whatever issue arose through appropriate treatment. Then, reinstate the dressing if you see fit. He treated it and subjected it to tension until it healed.
Chapter Eight.
In reducing the ribs if they are fractured, know that fractures of the ribs occur only in the toughest areas following the spine and their ends in front. Only pressure is applied to them because they are costal and the nature of this can be known by touch when examining with fingers.
Reduce it by aligning the fracture with the fingers until the shape is proper, then apply a compress and splint the broken bone if necessary. If the rib fracture is inclined inward, it will cause severe pain to the patient.
And it is prone to effusion like the effusion that occurs in those with pleurisy, because the bone can cause effusion and also lead to difficulty in breathing, coughing, and the expulsion of much blood, which is a difficult condition to treat. The ancients devised many remedies for this.
Some say that the patient should be given foods that produce flatulence to expand the abdomen and allow the fracture to protrude outward. We dislike this because it may confirm the occurrence of a hot tumor if one does not already exist. If a tumor has developed, however, it will worsen and confirm its presence.
Some said that a diaphoretic should be placed on the area, then firmly suctioned. This is more like a test, except that one fears the diaphoretic might draw fluid to that spot due to its weakened state. Others said that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
And the padding becomes situated between the ribs until it fills out, making the bandage level when rolled. Then the sore is treated with a dressing remedy from food and medicine, for if the sore is pressed, it is a severe condition that cannot be endured. And the bone would pierce the diaphragm painfully and we were afraid for the sore, so it should be necessary to incise the place and uncover the broken rib. Then we would place under it the device that preserves the cranial cavity, which has been described, and cut the bone gently and remove it.
Then we gather the edges of the wound if it is large with suturing and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling appears during this, act quickly by applying padding in rose oil and place it on the area, and treat the sore with what soothes the swelling from within as well.
And he should lie on the side that alleviates his sleep until it heals.
Chapter Nine.
To reduce dislocations of the back and neck.
As for the neck bones, if they suffer a fracture and such injuries are rare, while dislocations are more common. Similarly, the vertebrae of the back also—when such an injury occurs to someone, and you want to know whether it will heal or not. Then examine them and if you see that his hands have become relaxed and paralyzed, having no sensation or movement, unable to stretch, bend, or grasp, and if you press on them or needle them, he does not feel it or find any pain in them, know that in most cases it will not heal and is lost.
And if he moves them and feels with the probe and nuxs, know that the marrow of the bone is safe and the disease will be cured by treatment. If a vertebra is hit like that and you want to know whether it will also be cured or not.
And look at his feet; if you see that they have relaxed and what happened to the hands occurred in them, then when he lies on his back, wind and feces come out without intention, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out without intention. And if he lies on his back and intends to urinate but is unable to do so, know that he is lost; do not expect to cure him. If nothing like this occurs, the matter is milder, and the treatment for what has happened is to aim at soothing the hot swelling.
By placing on the tender vertebra either rose oil alone or with roasted egg yolks. Apply this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides, then apply one of the strengthening and drying poultices and bind it with a bandage. Order him to rest and remain calm.
And let him sleep only on the side that does not cause him pain until he recovers. If a shard or something similar was broken in the bone and has been removed, it should be necessary to incise his skin and extract that bone. Then gather the lips of the wound if it is large by suturing, then treat with the healing ointments until it heals. If another bone of the os navale breaks, which is the heel bone, it should be necessary to insert the thumb from the left hand into the acetabulum.
and the broken bone is aligned with the other hand according to what can be done and achieved, then it is wrapped with a bandage and a splint if needed, then it is tied up.
If you feel a broken fragment in it, split it open and extract it, and treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
The Tenth Chapter.
To treat a fracture of the hip.
Rarely do the hip bones break; if they do, the break may fragment into pieces, lengthwise split, or tilt inward. The patient will experience pain at the site, swelling, and numbness or paralysis in the leg on the side of the fracture.
To set it, pass your hand over it until you determine the shape of the fracture. If the break is only in the fragments, align those fragments as best you can so that they resemble their natural shape.
If the break is lengthwise or has tilted inward, place the patient on their belly so that you can set this fracture. Once aligned, wrap it with a bandage, then place a splint made of wood or leather over it and tie it securely.
Do not fear the transfer of the fracture or the removal of the splint. Align any displacement in the ilium with what fills it, until it takes on a level position. Order the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side. If a hot swelling occurs, address it accordingly.
Cease to extend or treat it until the hot swelling subsides, then apply what alleviates it as previously mentioned. Afterwards, return to setting and securing it properly. If there are fragments or any part has fractured, it should not be removed.
It should be smoothed from the outside as we said and the tension left until it heals.
The Eleventh Chapter.
On the Reduction of Breaks in the Forearm.
The forearm is the area between the elbow and the shoulder. If it breaks, reduce it in one of two ways. One way is to take a curved, smooth, medium-sized rod in this shape:.
And bind it at both ends with straps. Then suspend it from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair. Then place his broken arm on the rod until his elbow is adhering to the middle of the bend in the rod. Then hang something heavy from above.
Or a servant may extend it downward, then the doctor reduces the break with his hands until the fracture is in the proper position. The other way is for the patient to lie on his back and have his hand tied around his neck with a strap.
Then order servants to hold the upper part of the break with one hand and the lower part with the other. Each should stretch towards their respective sides. If you want the stretching to be stronger, bind below the break with a strap and above it with another, and each servant should stretch them towards their respective sides.
If the break is near the upper arm, the strap should be placed below the elbow and the other below the break towards the shoulder. If the break is near the shoulder, the straps should be placed in those positions and also on the shoulder itself.
Then adjust the fracture gently without violence until the fracture aligns properly and heals well. Then tighten it if no hot swelling appears; if a hot swelling does appear, leave tightening until the seventh day, and apply a dressed cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then tighten it. The method of tightening is to place the dressing over the fracture, then wrap a new cloth around the dressing, then join the arm to the same back and place his hand open on his hip.
And hold the bandage and tension on the back and arm, so that the arm substitutes for the splints if nothing prevents you from doing so and if there is no change in the broken bone. If you fear any change in the broken bone, use the splints.
Place a splint directly on the fracture itself that is wider and stronger than the other splints. There should be an interval of one finger's width between each splint. The length of the splints should correspond to the fracture, with an additional three fingers' width on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tension you mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
It should be that your tension is stronger at the location of the fracture.
The tension should be less the farther from the fracture. If you see that the splint and tension should be placed as we said when setting the bone, do so.
And if you fear the hot swelling, leave the tension and splints until the seventh day as we said. Then examine the bandage every three days to ensure there is no itching or puffiness, and that nutrition can reach the limb due to excessive tension. Correct all of this as we have mentioned.
If you are certain that nothing of the sort will happen, then release the bandage only after many days, and let the injured lie on his back with his hands on his abdomen, and place under the arm a pillow filled with wool, well-padded.
Examine at all times, day or night, lest the shape of the broken limb be altered or the bandage relax; correct all this by your efforts. And let the diet of the injured be as we have said before, that it should first be gentle, until the bone is about to strengthen.
It is necessary to strengthen his diet, for it is customary for the arm and leg to grow strong in forty days. Then you should release the bandage and use bathing and treatments appropriate for this purpose. If the fracture is severe and displaced, this should be addressed accordingly.
Do not remove the bandage from him until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the Fracture of the Arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, and they are called the radius and ulna. The smaller one follows the hand and is below the larger bone. The larger bone is positioned below the smaller one from below. Sometimes, only the largest bone (radius) breaks, or only the smaller bone (ulna) breaks, and sometimes both break together.
When the upper smaller bone (ulna) breaks, its fracture is easy to treat and heals faster. When the lower bone (radius) breaks, its fracture is worse and harder to heal. If both bones break together, it is the worst. If the upper smaller bone (ulna) breaks, then...
The surgeon should make the duration gentle with care until it is aligned. If the large nail is broken, he should make the duration somewhat stronger. If all the nails are broken, he should make the duration very strong indeed.
The shape of the hand should be considered when setting and extending it on a cushion. The thumb should be above all the fingers, and the index finger should be below the rest. The patient should be seated leaning forward.
Let the cushion be at the same height so that the patient does not incur difficulty.
Then, the arm should be extended from below either by hand or with a bandage. Another attendant should extend it from above similarly. Then, the surgeon should align the bone until he restores it to the best possible shape. If there are fragments in the broken bone, they should be removed.
Restore each fragment in its place as much as you can. If a detached fragment is visible and it causes the skin to peel, and there is no hope of setting it, cut into it and extract it according to the method described earlier. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, it has been given a separate section.
If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of setting, apply a compress of cilantro prepared with rose oil and white wax. Make it moderately thick and tightly but gently bind the cloth around it until the swelling subsides.
Remove the cilantro and apply a compress prepared from flour dust and egg white. Then, place the splints; let the splint that goes on top of the break be slightly wider and stronger. Know that the number of splints for the arm is usually six in most cases.
Was the fracture in one canal or both canals together, then make your pull at the site of the fracture stronger and more intense. And whenever you turn the pull upwards or downwards, make the pull a bit lax as previously mentioned at the beginning of this section.
Let the tear that wraps around the fracture be soft and moist, not too hard. The thread with which you pull, using a special catgut, should be medium between being very thin and thick, as we described. Check the organ and ligament after a few days.
If anything needs to be corrected, such as itching that occurs in the organ, it should be treated by washing the organ with warm water until the itching subsides. The organ should then be left untied for a night until it rests, and then pulling should be resumed.
If the pull has become lax and the bone has moved or if there is any such condition, make every effort to correct it. Also, if the food is prevented from reaching the organ due to excessive pulling, you should relax it a bit and leave it for some days until the food begins to reach it again, then pull it.
If nothing has occurred to the patient as mentioned, he should not be allowed to get up until twenty days or so have passed. Then hang the patient's hand around his neck and let his arm be moderate. He should guard against sudden movements and make his sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm will heal in thirty days or in twenty-nine, and it might heal in twenty-eight days. All of this depends on the conditions of the humors and the strength of the person.
The Thirteenth Chapter.
In the Reduction of Fractures of the Wrist and Fingers.
If the wrist and stability of the fingers are involved, fractures are rare. However, displacements occur frequently. If either the wrist or a displacement of the fingers is fractured.
It is necessary that the patient sit in a reclining position with a chair opposite him levelly.
Then place his hand extended on it. Then the bone setter stretches the broken bones, and the physician sets them until they unite properly. At that point, it is necessary to apply the bandage and splint if no hot swelling occurs, then a cast should be applied from above according to the location.
And I have included it in a soft cloth. If the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, make something resembling a ball from the cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with his broken hand. Then tie it tightly with a long piece of cloth.
And the cast should be made of leather with a soft lining so that the skin can grow along with the bending of the entire wrist. Tie it tightly as needed. If the fracture is outward, the cast should be applied from above and another one underneath the wrist to keep the hand open and straight.
Then, apply the tension as the hand turns, and tie the fingers together with the bandage. If the fracture involves one of the stability ligaments of the fingers, set it properly, then tighten it along with the wrist. If you wish, make a small standing cast to set the fracture.
No movement should occur; if the fracture is in any of the other fingers like the ring finger, middle finger, or thumb, then it should be aligned and fixed with the correct finger next to it, or all of them should be fixed together by ligature, which is better, or a small standing plaster should be placed on it.
As we said about the thumb, examine both during and after reduction of the swelling with what is appropriate, if anything like this occurs as described.
Fourteenth Chapter.
In the Fixation of Fractures of the Thigh.
The thigh bone is often fractured and can be felt because it moves forward and backward. Its fixation should be done by tying a bandage above the fracture and another below the fracture, with the patient lying on his stomach.
Then, each bandage should be extended to its side with an equal tension if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. If it is close to the upper part of the thigh, it should be fixed with a softer bandage made of wool or something similar.
At the upper part of the thigh near the groin, the bandage should be extended upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture. If the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be placed near the knee to extend downwards. Then, the doctor should align the bone with both hands until it is restored to its natural shape.
The bone will unite well. Then, the bandage and ligature should be applied if the limb does not develop a hot swelling. If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for some days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to treating it.
As for tightening it, it should be folded on the fracture with a wide stiff cap two or three times and what remains should be left. Then, fold the leg so that the heel is at the root of the ligament and insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below. The ends of the thread should be from above from both sides.
Then, wrap what remains of the cap around the leg and thigh. Place the splints on the thigh at the same location as the fracture, and put one splint on the shin bone. Fill the gap between the thigh and the leg with soft cloth to equalize the tension.
Then begin with strong tightening from the middle at the location of the fracture three or four times. The tighter you pull the bandage away from the location of the fracture, the less tight and softer it should be.
Then, address the ends of the thread you inserted between the thigh and the leg. Bind these with the splints above, then pass the ends of the thread downward until you reach the heel. Tighten them also with the other ends of the splints from the other side.
To ensure the bandage does not shift from its place, then leave the tension on it as long as the member shows no signs of necrosis, swelling, or distension. If anything like that occurs, address it promptly and correct whatever happens as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a shard in the bone that causes pain, it should be smoothed if possible. If not, cut it out and extract it, treating the wound as described earlier until it heals. This fracture of the thigh may tighten without needing additional splints on the leg.
As we mentioned in the arm, except that its reduction does not expose the patient to a limp if reduced alone without being associated with the leg, it is necessary for its owner to be lame forever.
Know that the thigh strengthens in fifty days or a little more or a little less; all of this depends on the difference in temperaments and other conditions.
Fifteenth Chapter.
On Fracture of the Patella.
The patella seldom suffers a fracture, although it can be broken frequently. If a fracture does occur, it is either a crack or a break into its parts, whether accompanied by a wound or not.
And you can determine all of this by touch. To reduce it, align what has separated in its parts with the fingers until it comes together and heals according to how well alignment, gentle handling, and skill are achieved. Then apply a bandage and, if necessary, a circular splint.
And tighten the bandage above the appropriate tightness. Then manage all the conditions we described for other fractures, such as hot swelling, by counteracting each symptom with what is suitable until it heals.
Sixteenth Chapter.
On Reduction of Fracture of the Leg.
The leg has two bones: one is thick and is called the shinbone, and the other is thin and is called the tibia. Both are subject to types of fractures similar to those of the upper arm bones. Therefore, its reduction is the same as that of the arm, and the work is one. If both bones are broken, the leg turns in all directions. If only the finer bone is broken, the leg turns forward. And if only the thicker bone is broken and this happens lower down, this is something you are not unaware of.
Apply stretching and straightening and bind the fractures according to that, whether the break of the leg is a severe one with many shards. In such cases, the stretching should be less intense and you should be more gentle in its reduction.
And in the leg, there is something additional to the arm, which is that if you straighten the fractures and have finished all your work, take two fist-sized pieces of pine wood used for leveling rooms placed between the cracks of board joints or made from date palm leaves or similar materials.
Choose from it what is slightly thick, and let it not be thin strips. Let the length of each be equal to the length of the leg from the knee downwards. Then wrap each with two layers of cloth along its length, placing one strip on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let it extend from the knee to the foot, then tie the fṣqītin in three places at the ends and the middle. With this bandage, it will prevent the leg from leaning left or right and will immobilize it well. A wooden splint can also be used along the length of the leg.
It should be placed to preserve it from movement. You should do this more often if the fracture is accompanied by a specific wound, especially. Then inspect the leg every day and attend to it with great care for any swelling or puffiness or other such conditions. If such a thing happens, deal with it as should be done for recovery, and the broken thigh bone will heal in thirty days or so.
Seventeenth Chapter.
In Broken Bones of the Leg and Fingers.
As for the heel, it never breaks at all. As for the bones of the leg, they may break, and the fingers also rarely break; but sprains occur most often in them.
If the bones of the leg break and you see that some of these bones have approached each other, let the patient place his foot on the ground with it upright as when walking. Then rise and place your foot where those bones have raised, and press on them and straighten them.
Until it returns to its place. Then take the bandage and the pressure pad, place a small board under the sole of the foot, which has two flat ends, then tightly bind the foot with it after wrapping it in cloth and whatever else you need.
If three or four days have passed, release the bandage. You will find the bones either in their proper alignment if they were broken, or dislocated; proceed accordingly. As for if some fingers are broken, set and straighten them as described to you for setting the hand fingers.
Then make a splint for the broken finger along its length, and let it be slightly wider than the finger. Place this board under the foot as described, and bind it tightly. If the bones that broke are two or three or more, do so accordingly.
Make a splint of the width of one degree on a soft cloth for each finger and secure it at the bottom of the foot. Let each end of the splint protrude slightly from under the sole of the foot to hold securely.
You should not forget to observe all that we have mentioned for other fractures, dealing with each symptom as appropriate.
The Eighteenth Chapter.
In the Fracture of the Pubic Bone and the Symphysis Pubis in Women and Men.
When the vulva of a woman is fractured, seat her and lean her slightly backward. She should be supported from behind. Then, the midwife should pack the vulva with cotton until it is fully filled and becomes spherical in her vulva.
Then, shake the woman gently and gradually raise her spine slightly. As a result, the cotton will come out until it is at the entrance of the vulva, resembling a ball. This will help复原骨折的骨头。然后在她背上放置敷料，如果她想要小便，轻轻地取出棉花，让她小便。
Then, replace it as you first inserted it. Return to her original dressing. Do this for seven days or so, as it will heal. If you prefer, you can use a sheep's bladder; tie a tube at its mouth and insert the entire bladder into her vulva.
Then, blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder inflates inside the vulva. This will help复原骨折的骨头。然后用棉花填满，按照我们描述的方法保持几天直至痊愈。至于男人或女人的耻骨骨折，则需要用适当的治疗方法复位。
And I have adjusted it according to what we described in the bone of the hip, and it is not hidden from you the correctness in these rare fractures which occur seldomly, especially for one who has some experience and understands this book indeed, because the fracture itself guides you in most cases.
On the correct method of setting and binding it, understand well. As for the case of a man whose thigh bone is fractured, mention him briefly: you enter the genital area with an ass's weight, then put a bandage on it and bind it and leave it for three days or about that time until it heals.
Nineteenth Chapter.
On the setting of bone fractures accompanied by a wound.
It is advisable for one who is presented with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or upper arm or similar, to set it immediately from its proper time if the conditions for setting are present as we have previously mentioned.
If the wound is bleeding, it is advisable to treat it immediately by applying a poultice of powder if you have nothing else at hand. Then proceed with setting the fracture on that same day without delaying.
If no hot swelling occurs, then if a hot swelling does occur, delay setting it until the ninth day until the hot swelling subsides. Do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, as it has exposed him to bad symptoms.
If the broken bone is exposed through the skin, it is advisable to try to reduce and adjust it gently with your hands. If you are not able to reduce and adjust it with your hands, do so using this instrument, which is made of iron, about seven or eight fingers in length. Expose it according to the size of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should take from it three or four, according to what he needs for treatment in each kind of fracture. Let it be a little thin in thickness so that it does not bend when pricked during the time of work.
And let its tip be sharp, with a slight bend at its tip. Its upper part should be slightly thick, while the lower half should be very thin. This is its shape:.
And it is called in Greek Perim, meaning a small nail. It should be made with its sharp, curved tip touching the end of the displaced bone, and it should be driven in once. When the bone returns to its position and some alignment is achieved, remove it and align the ends of the fracture with each other.
If its broken tip is thin and the machine did not grip it well, it should be cut at that tip so that the machine can grip it properly. If you are unable to reduce the bone as described at all, cut it as similar to the cuts we have mentioned.
Or spread it with one of the levers as much as possible. Then, remove any roughness and thin layers from the bone. If you reduce the bone and find that the patient experiences severe pain after reduction, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to reduce it to its natural position, do so, for this will greatly benefit the patient. Once your reduction is complete, immerse a cloth in a contracting black and special decoction; especially if it is summer. Do not apply any oil or ointment to the wound.
To prevent decay and corruption, then use the splints while you are finishing the bone setting and leave the wound open by making a hole in the bandages with scissors according to the size of the wound.
Be very careful not to tie the wound with the fracture, for many unskilled doctors have done this and caused either death or infection or swelling in their patients. Your tying should be soft and relaxed, different from the tying of other fractures.
If the wound is poor or is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he finds pain in the place troubling, then you should not put splints on it. Instead, make bandages from strong torn cloth in the place of the splints and tie him with them.
If after one or two days you see that the wound has begun to produce pus, remove the bandage that was placed on it with moistening. Then use the fomentations and ointments which we are accustomed to apply to wounds, such as the quadruple ointment and similar ones. You should loosen the bandages.
You should inspect the wound in the evening and morning every day until it heals and recovers. It is necessary that the limb be positioned so that the pus flows downward easily. If days pass and the wound does not heal, and the pus continues to drain, know that there are small fragments of bone present.
You should examine the wound with a probe; what was from those fragments detached, remove and extract it. And what remained unremoved, if it causes the limb to decay and pain, burn it in pieces and remove it completely as you can.
If the wound shows signs of congestion or putrefaction or another type of corruption and contamination, it should be met with what corresponds to each sign from the treatment described in its respective section.
And you should pay attention to my words and understand them: if a large bone, such as the thigh bone or the humerus and similar large bones, is fractured and there is displacement in the limb, do not attempt to pull it or extract it. For often, such displacement leads to death. Rather, leave it until it decomposes; perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment. Otherwise, leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of congestion that occurs following some fractures.
This congestion often occurs following the healing of fractures, especially those near joints. It can distort the shape of the limb and may even prevent the limb from performing its natural functions.
Examine it; if the congestion is soft, use remedies that constrict, such as saffron, frankincense, bitter substances, henbane, and acanthus, and so on. You may take some of these or all of them and mix them with a constricting decoction, or with egg white, or with vinegar.
And apply it to the congestion with difficulty and tighten it securely. Leave the tightening for many days without loosening it, then loosen it and repeat with another one until the congestion goes away by God's will, or secure a sheet of well-forged lead tightly over it.
If the mercury has a special property that removes whatever has formed in the organs, if the complication has hardened and intensified and necessity has urged removal of it, then make an incision from above and remove the excretions or strip them with some instruments until it goes away, and treat the wound until it heals.
The Twenty-First Chapter.
In treating fractures, if the bone heals but the limb remains soft and different from its original state.
If a bone fracture heals but the limb remains soft and weak, this is due to many reasons. One of the reasons is either excessive relaxation of the ligaments and re-tying them improperly, or excessive tightening of the ligaments to the point where nutrition cannot flow to the limb, or excessive and extreme fomentation, or excessive movements at improper times, or lack of blood in the patient's body and his weakness.
Treatment involves nourishing the patient and enriching his body to increase the blood in it, using steam baths, introducing joy and happiness, and the like. Then, applying fomentation to the limb to draw much nutrition onto it, or continuously fomenting it with lukewarm water. Until nutrition flows into it and returns it to its natural shape.
The Twenty-Second Chapter.
In treating fractured bones that heal crooked and prevent them from functioning as they should.
When a member that has been set after it healed shows distortion or displacement of the broken bone, or complications and deformation occurred for which reason the appearance of the member was spoiled. Except when the member does not refrain from its natural function, it should not be necessary to accept the claim that one can break a member even if it had healed, as this was often done by many ignorant physicians and bone-setters in our country.
And this action is severely blamed, leading to great danger, made easier by the physician. But if the distortion and complication are recent, it should be treated with water in which mild herbs have been boiled, such as palm-leaf, root, and crown-of-thorns, and similar substances.
And it is dressed with mild poultices such as well-made diaxilon or one takes the saliva of the root of the palm-leaf, mixes it with chicken fat and shiraj ointment, and dresses it with this. Or one takes juicy grapes, grinds them with guava residue and similar medications known as emetics.
And the complication will not resolve without constant gentle massage with hands, using the movement of the member in all directions at all times. If the distortion has become severe and hardened, and it is necessary to treat it with iron.
It should be cut above, releasing the connection of the bone and cutting what remains of the complication or bone with gentle cuts. Great care and gentleness must be used in this. Then, treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is the displacement of a joint from its proper place, hindering movement and deforming the organ. It causes severe pain and distress to the patient. Whenever this occurs, it should be addressed immediately to return it to its proper position.
It should not be delayed at all, for if it is delayed, the area will swell with a bruise that makes it harder to reduce the jaw. Therefore, it should not be delayed, moved, or extended when it is swollen, as it often causes spasms and painful distress to the patient.
But if this occurs, it should be addressed by first reducing the swelling. Then, it should be left until the bruise subsides slightly. After that, the organ should be treated with warm water and oil. Finally, it should be gently reduced, and each part should be treated as described in its respective section.
And I have also arranged the chapters on the jaw in accordance with what was mentioned for fractures, from the top of the body to the bottom.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In the Treatment of the Lower Jaw.
The jawbones脱落仅在罕见的情况下，脱位有两种情况：要么轻微移位而略有松弛，要么完全脱位而彻底松弛。 Down to the vicinity of the chest, causing the patient to salivate excessively and unable to control it, and he cannot close his jaw, with his tongue jumbling when speaking. If the dislocation is slight, it often returns by itself with minimal intervention.
And if the dislocation is complete, it should be reduced with speed and not be delayed at all; this being that a servant holds the patient's head while the physician inserts his single finger at the root of the jaw inside his mouth if the jaw is on one side.
Or he inserts both his fingers at the root of the jaw if it is dislocated on both sides, and his other fingers from outside align it by doing so. He should order the patient to relax his jaw and let it go to every direction. The physician then aligns the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult to reduce them, especially if both jaws are involved, apply a cloth soaked in hot water and ointment until they become easier to reduce. Do not delay their reduction at all as we have said. If they return and align, and the patient's mouth closes without relaxing, then at that time place on them sutures with quirti prepared from wax and ointment.
Then tie them gently with a relaxed bandage, and let the patient lie on his back with his head elevated between two pillows to prevent him from moving right or left. He should not be made to chew anything; instead, provide him with soft, easy-to-eat food.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is healed, let him eat as he pleases, and use it gently. Do not force him to open his mouth wide when eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is fully healed and recovered.
If it is difficult to reduce the jaws when they remain dislocated for some time without returning to their places, this often results in fevers and constant headaches. The patient's stomach may become distended, and he may vomit bitter fluids repeatedly. If you see these conditions, know that there is a complication.
Often it is fatal within ten days.
The Twenty-Fifth Chapter.
For the Reduction of the Hyoid Bone and Humeral Head.
As for the trachea, it is not detached from the inner side by its connection to the chest. It may, however, be detached outwardly, and this can be perceived by touch. Its reduction involves having the patient lie on his back and extending his arms.
Then press the area with your hand firmly; it will return to place. Place a bandage and padding over it and secure it. As for its end that follows the humerus and is connected to it, it does not dislocate except rarely. If it does dislocate at any time, it should be reduced and aligned as we have mentioned and as you are capable of doing.
Then place a bandage and padding over it, secure it with a bandage, and order the patient to remain quiet and still until he recovers. By this same treatment, you can reduce the humeral head if it also has displaced from its position.
The Twenty-Sixth Chapter.
For the Reduction of the Humeral Head.
Know that the humeral head can dislocate in three ways: one, it may dislocate towards the elbow downward; two, it may dislocate towards the chest area; and perhaps it may dislocate above the humeral head, which occurs rarely.
It does not dislocate towards the back due to the position of the shoulder, nor towards the front near the nerve. It most often dislocates and comes out downward towards the elbow, especially in those with little muscle mass, as it comes out quickly and goes back in quickly.
As for those with much flesh, it is the opposite; that is, he will exit with difficulty and enter with difficulty. Sometimes a blow or fall may cause swelling of the biceps and burning inflammation, so one should examine this to ascertain its condition.
Then advance in treating him, and the jaw will be recognized if it is directed downward toward the wrist. If you join the dislocated bicep to the healthy bicep, you will find a clear discrepancy between them and find that the head of the bicep is displaced. Upon touching below the elbow, you will find the head of the bicep like an egg.
And the afflicted cannot raise his hand to his ear nor move it through all its motions. Similarly, if it dislocates toward the chest or above, you will find this evident upon touch, not hidden.
And this jaw can be easily reduced if it is soft or if the afflicted is a child. To reduce it, have him raise his hand above, then place your thumbs under his elbow and lift the joint forcefully upward to its proper position while the servant raises his hand and extends it above.
Then lower it slowly; it will return quickly. If it does not return as mentioned, and the dislocation is recent having occurred in many days, the afflicted should take a bath in hot water and use something relaxing and softening like boiling horseradish, cress, and crown flower in the water.
Then, the afflicted should lie on his back with a ball of wool placed under his elbow, which is moderate in firmness between soft and hard. Then, the doctor should place his heel on the ball and grasp the afflicted's hand with his hand and lower it downward.
If he kicks the ball, it will return to its place. If you wish to reverse its direction, do this: bring a man taller than the patient and stop him from one side, placing his elbow under the armpit of the patient and lifting his arm so that the patient is suspended in the air. And another attendant pulls the patient's hand downward to his abdomen. If the patient is light, it should be weighted down with something else; then it will return its jaw from its place, and it may also return in another direction.
It should be focused on the ground a long plank, having its end round like the pestle of a mortar, neither thick nor thin. Then place it under the patient's arm pit after putting a soft cut on its end. The patient should stand along the length of the plank.
Then extend his hand downward from the other side and also extend his body from the other side with force. The joint will return to its place quickly. If it is difficult to return it as described, use this treatment: take a plank about two arms' length in size. Its width should be four fingers, and its thickness two fingers. It should have a round end to make it easier to enter the depth of the armpit as shown.
Then tie a soft cut on the round end to prevent the plank from harming the patient. Place it under the armpit, extend the entire hand and arm onto the plank downward, and tie the plank to the back, elbow, and hand.
Then place the arm on a bar. Slide it width-wise and extend the hand downward. Leave the rest of the body suspended from the other side. The joint will slip into its place. If it enters in any position possible, place a moderate-sized ball of wool under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage with flour dust and egg white is applied to the entire thigh as if from above. Then the ball is tightly tied under the elbow and is wrapped with the bandage from above, and his hand is attached to his neck.
He should leave his hand unused for seven days, and it is necessary to make the patient's food light until the limb strengthens; this is quicker for its healing. Then it can be released after seven or five days, and he should be trained with movement. If it has stabilized and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to moisture or another affliction, it should be treated with cauterization using three sesamum seeds as described in the chapter on cauterization. If this is done and the bandage is relaxed after seven days, but the joint does not stabilize.
And if you have applied the bandage and tightened it several times, but it does not stabilize and falls, relaxing and cannot be lifted above, then know that the nerve at the head of the thigh has either snapped or elongated or relaxed. Thus, know that the joint will never remain in its place.
And as for the jaw that is near the chest and breast and to its back, it should be reduced by pushing and stretching with the hands until it returns. Various tightening and treatment methods should be applied until it heals. If a mass appears in the limb after healing and the movement becomes slower.
The patient should take frequent baths until the mass softens and returns to its original state.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
In the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.
Dislocation of the elbow occurs with difficulty and can be reduced with difficulty as well. It dislocates in all directions, particularly forward or backward. The dislocation of the elbow is not hidden from you because it lies beneath the sight and touch, whatever form the dislocation takes.
And when you compare the dislocated elbow with the normal one, you will recognize it clearly by examining the joint. The arm cannot be bent, and the elbow cannot touch its armpit. It is advisable to act promptly and reduce the dislocation before a hot swelling appears.
For if a hot swelling appears, it is difficult to reduce it, and it may never be completely cured, especially if the dislocation is backward. This is the worst type of dislocation and the most painful. Death often accompanies such cases.
To reduce it, if it can be reduced, have an assistant extend his hands with both palms up and his arm stretched out. The physician's hands should be placed from above the elbow and below it, pushing the joint with both thumbs or the roots of his hands until it returns to its proper place.
If the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by bending the arm once, striking it with the root of the palm that aligns with the elbow. If the dislocation does not return, use strong traction. This involves stretching the arm forcefully with two assistants.
The patient should be held by two assistants to prevent slipping during the traction. Then, wrap the arm in a folded cloth or a wide cloth and turn it in all directions. When the physician grasps the joint with his hands, rub it with oil to facilitate the reduction of the dislocation easily.
Then the joint is dislocated forcefully until it returns, and upon its return, a bandage containing compression and drying with the white of an egg should be applied, and it should be tightened firmly. The arm should be suspended from the collarbone and left for days.
Then it is resolved. If the joint remains in its place, release the ligament and leave it alone. If you see that the joint has not tightened sufficiently, reapply the bandage and ligament and leave it for days until it tightens, then resolve it. If a swelling occurs after the return of the joint and its resolution, let it be.
And if there is difficulty in movement, let the application be in the bath and gentle massage and cupping until it softens. Or make a lever with a fatty sheep and bind it to the joint, leaving it there for a day and a night, then remove it and put him in the bath. If he sweats, rub the joint with moderate rubbing.
Then reapply the lever once, twice, and thrice with entering the bath until it softens. If you wish to put a moistened ox hide on him with oil, do that repeatedly; for it will soften and return to its original state.
The Twenty-Eighth Section.
In the Treatment of Wrist Dislocation.
The wrist of the hand is often dislocated, and reducing its fracture is easier than that of other joints. Nevertheless, it should be reduced at the hour it dislocates before it becomes swollen or hot.
Fix his jaw by placing the patient's wrist on a board and extend a servant's hand and place the doctor's hand on the back of the joint and push it until it returns, unless one should look whether the jaw has dislocated to the inner side of the hand.
Let the patient place the back of his hand on the board during extension and flexion. If the jaw is protruding to the outer side of the hand, let him place the inner part of his hand on the board so that the doctor's hand can be placed at the same joint. If it returns to its place, otherwise bind it with a soothing compress for the swelling.
Leave it alone and do not attempt to reduce it again, for it cannot be endured and you will not be able to reduce it after a few days unless the joint remains in its place without causing any harm to the patient, except if the hand relaxes and is unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve has snapped or is detached, for there is no remedy except to bind it with a splint; it may help or may not help at all. Once the wrist is reduced, apply the splint as described, then bind it and leave it alone for five days.
Then exercise and train the hand. If its movement is hindered or there is any stiffness in it, soften it with hot water and massage several times until it becomes flexible.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Jaws of Fingers.
If the fingers dislocate in all directions, and if one of them dislocates to the outer side or inner side of the hand, extend the finger and push the jaw with your thumb until it returns. Then bind the end of the finger and suspend it towards the direction it dislocated to.
Leave it for two days then release and stretch it until it becomes straight. If at night you find it as such, let her walk during the day and exercise her with movement and tie her at night. Continue doing this for days until she strengthens.
Do the same with it if it breaks towards the palm of the hand; tie it in about the same side and do with it as you did first until it heals. Do the same with it whenever it breaks towards any other direction.
The Thirtieth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Dislocating Beads of the Back.
If a bead of the back or neck dislocates completely, or if many beads have shifted from their places, there is no treatment for it, as death will speed up towards the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's feces are expelled without intent, as he cannot retain them. Often, some of his limbs relax, either both his legs and arms or one of them. If only one bead shifts from its place, it often disappears on its own.
And its disappearance can occur in four directions: that which disappears towards the back is called "hudda" (protrusion). As for its treatment, you should examine it. If the protrusion occurred in childhood, there is no treatment and no cure for it at all. However, if it occurred due to a fall or a blow, etc., then treatment may be applicable.
And I have mentioned various methods of treatment with long descriptions that do not yield much benefit. I have simplified what was said, so that a little explanation suffices instead of much of what they provided, and I have illustrated the apparatus differently from how they explained and described it.
I say that the curvature occurring in front in the chest has no remedy and cannot be cured. Likewise, this is so for that occurring on both sides. Only that which occurs specifically in the back can be treated with what I am describing, which is to extend the affected person in his position.
Place a level dock near the wall and stretch a wet thatch underneath it so as not to hurt his chest. Then place a vertical board planted in a hole in the ground at one end of the dock towards his head, and another board towards his feet at the other end of the dock.
And a servant holds the board, and let it not be secured in the hole. Another servant holds the other board in that manner. Then wrap around the affected person's chest and under their armpits with a soft tight cloth, and extend the end of the cloth to the board near his head and tie him there.
Then tie another cloth above his knees and above his ankles, and at the level of his armpits. Gather all the straps and tie them to the other board near his feet. Then each servant stretches the board towards their side with the strap, ensuring that neither board moves from its fixed position.
Except that they are not secured as we said. The physician places his hands on the peg with force until it returns, or he places a board on it. Then he leans his feet on the board until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, take a board whose length is about three cubits.
And a hole is dug in the wall near the location we said should be for the affected person. The end of the board enters this hole. Then place the middle of the board on the curvature, and place the physician's feet on the other end. He should tighten it well until he presses the peg.
Return it to its place, and if you wish to make it with the tube that is spun by hand, it is that you plant in the ground at the head of the ill one at the end of the couch two pieces of wood whose length is a cubit, and at his feet also in the end of the couch likewise two pieces of wood.
Let there be a span between each piece of wood, and make a hole in each piece through which the tube passes. Secure all the pieces of wood to the ground tightly enough so that they do not move at all. Insert a round rod, which is the tube, into which the bandage is coiled in the holes of the two pieces of wood.
At one end of it, make a hole in which you secure a rod a span long to coil the bandage. Do the same in the other piece of wood. Then, tighten the bandage that you have tightened around the chest of the ill one on the tube near his head, and the bandages that you have tightened around his legs on the tube near his feet.
Then, stand by each tube a servant who spins it with his hand using the spindle with which the tube is coiled. The doctor straightens out the bump as we have mentioned before. This is a depiction of the tube, the couch, and the ill one.
Then, after the vertebrae have returned to their place and the area is straightened, it should be covered with a dried bandage soaked in egg white, then pressed. Then, place over the bandage a splint made of wood whose width is three fingers or so, and whose length is sufficient to cover the bump.
And keep some correct beads, then bind it with the bandage that is appropriate. The ill one should use gentle food until he recovers. If some knots remain in the area after full recovery, it should be treated with medicines that relax and soften, along with the use of the splint we described for a long time.
And for this, a lead plate may be used. And there may appear a notch at the end of the vertebrae, and one may think it is dislodgement, and it would be an extra bone that has notched. Do not treat it with this remedy, for perhaps death may occur.
The Thirty-First Chapter.
In the Treatment of Dislocated Hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are dislocated only by displacement, not by a slight separation or subluxation, as is the case with other joints. The hip joint can be dislocated in four directions.
And this is because it can dislocate inward, outward, forward, and backward. It dislocates more frequently inward, and less often forward or backward. The sign of its displacement inward is that if you compare the healthy thigh of the unaffected side with the affected side, the affected side appears longer.
The knee will be more extended than the healthy side. The affected thigh cannot bend at the waist, and the area below the waist will appear swollen with a distinct swelling before the femur head has shifted there.
The sign of dislocation outward is the opposite of these symptoms. The sign of dislocation forward is that he will fully extend his leg, but cannot bend it without pain, and there will be no swelling in the knee. If he tries to walk, he will not be able to do so forward.
He will retain his urine and his waist will appear swollen. When walking, his step will be on the heel. The sign of dislocation backward is that he cannot straighten his knee or bend it before bending the waist, and his affected leg will also be shorter than the other.
The Arabic is relaxed and the position of the thigh bone at the location of the thigh is clear. As for refuting this type of fracture, you should look and see if the fracture is old, having remained in its place without attempt to reduce it and has remained in that state; there is no remedy for it at all.
It should not be treated if the fracture is new. As for one that has been fractured recently, whether it is of any kind from the four-sided fractures, you should promptly twist the joint and extend it inward and outward, and move it left and right; perhaps.
It returned and did not require any other treatment. If it does not return in this manner, you should use a strong assistant to extend his leg from below either with your hands or with a strap tied above the knee on his leg. Another assistant should extend him from above.
By inserting his hands under his armpits, then tying a soft strap at the root of the thigh and holding the end of the strap with a third assistant. The extension should be either from in front towards the clavicle or from behind towards the back.
They should extend him all at once so that the injured part rises with his body from the ground and remains suspended. This type of extension is common for all four kinds. If the fracture returns as we said, then no special treatment is necessary. Otherwise, each kind requires the specific treatment I have mentioned.
As for its specific reduction if the fracture is inward, the injured should lie on his healthy side, then place a strap at the root of the thigh between the thigh bone and the position below the armpit.
Then the ligature is extended upwards from the Arabian side to the upper part of the body towards the clavicle. Then another strong assistant supports it with his arms and holds the thick part of the delicate thigh tightly, extending it strongly outward; for otherwise, it will return to its place.
This kind is easier than other types of treatment by which this part can be restored. If you find it difficult and it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, it will be necessary to tie the legs of the delicate one firmly with a strong, flexible ligature on the ankles and the knees.
It should be four fingers' breadth from each of its neighbors, and the delicate leg should be extended more than the other by about two fingers' breadth. Then the delicate one is suspended from the head by a beam in the house, and there should be a distance of about an arm's length from the ground.
Then you order a strong boy to hold the upper part of the thigh and another boy hangs the delicate one, pushing the boy holding the thigh with force. For the joint will return to its place quickly, but if it is displaced outward, it will be复原。请注意，翻译已结束。
Then the delicate one should lie on the bench as we described for the convex case, and the ligature should be tightened particularly around his delicate leg and chest. Then two beams are placed under his legs and head, respectively. Finally, a additional beam is placed in the middle of the bench and securely fixed.
It should be wrapped with a wet cloth to prevent injuring the delicate one. Place the beam between his thighs so that it does not slip downward during extension. Then each assistant extends towards their side, and the doctor adjusts the hip with his hands; if it responds by returning.
And otherwise, place the board upon it and cover it as we mentioned in convexity the same. Except that it should be that the affected lie on his correct side. And if the dislocation is to the front, it should be lengthened by one time and he should remain in this description exactly on the deck.
The doctor places the掌侧 of his right hand on the affected iliac bone and presses it with the other hand, making the pressure extend downward to the knee region. If the dislocation is to the rear, it should not be lengthened downward.
It is elevated from the ground. It should be placed on something solid. Also, it should be abducted to the side as we mentioned when he was lying on his side with the ligaments tightened.
As we said before, it should also be compressed with the board at the site where the joint has dislocated. When the hip joint returns to its proper place, you will not fail to notice the sign of its return, which is that the affected side leg can be lengthened.
When you see them level and the affected one can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned to its proper place. Then compare the thighs and apply the bandage, tightening it with a cloth so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The affected one must remain at rest for three or four days. Then remove the ligaments and bandage, and compare the legs with each other. If you find them equal in length, know that the joint has stabilized. Then release the affected one to walk. If you see any signs of relaxation, proceed with caution.
Rejoin and compress it according to your initial strength, and leave it also for three days. Then dissolve it and let him walk on it slowly for several days until it strengthens indeed if Allah wills.
The Second and Third Chapter.
In the Treatment of Dislocation of the Knee.
The knee dislocates on three sides: to the inside, to the outside, and downwards (behind). It never dislocates forwards. The sign of its dislocation is to order the patient to hug his leg to his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. To reduce all sides of its dislocation, order the patient to sit leaning forward with his legs stretched out if he can do so. Then seat a servant behind him to hold his midsection and bend him slightly backward. You should then sit on his thighs.
And place your back against his face, and position his leg between your legs. Then hold his knee with both your hands and interlace your fingers around his knee. With great strength, press the sides of his knee with your palms. Meanwhile, another servant should stretch his leg until the knee returns to its proper place.
And the sign that it has returned is that the leg adheres to the thigh willingly and comfortably. Then dress it, adhere the leg to the thigh, and bind them all together with a bandage for three or four days. Then release them. Use only light walking for several days until it strengthens.
If you are unable to reduce it as described, then use the strong stretching with the bandages I have described for treating the hip until it returns.
The Thirty-Third Chapter.
In the Treatment of Dislocating the Heel.
The heel may dislocate partially and may be reduced completely. Its reduction may be either inward or outward. The sign of its reduction is that you will see the heel swollen and protruding towards the side to which it was reduced.
As for the treatment of its partial dislocation, it is easy to reduce it by gently stretching with the hands and aligning it until it returns to place. As for its complete dislocation, it should be seated in a sitting position, and a strong servant should hold him from behind, supporting him in the middle.
Then hold his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below at the ankle. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand two times. Stretch it with your left hand and push the chest of the foot towards the leg gently with your right hand.
Do this twice as we have described. In the third time, push the chest of the foot towards the leg while pulling the ankle. If it returns in one or two attempts and you see the foot level, then continue. Otherwise, redo the process; it will return to place.
If it does not return as we have described, then place the injured person on his back on the ground and drive in two stakes firmly into the ground to be placed between his thighs, and wrap him with a cloth to prevent any harm to the injured. Then a servant should secure his thighs.
Then another attendant stretches the limb either with his hands or with a belt that ties it around the ankle, then each attendant stretches differently from his companion and the prop is upright between my healthy thigh supporting him so that his body does not fall downward upon stretching, then the physician straightens the jaw with his hands.
And another attendant holds the healthy leg downward, for the jaw returns quickly. When the jaw returns and you see that its return is correct, carry the splint and difficulty and tie it tightly with belts and secure the foot with the belt downward. It is advisable to beware of the nerve that is above the heel from behind.
Lest the belt be too tight and hurt him, then leave it on for two or three days. If the belt relaxes, tighten it again, then release it on the third or fourth day. The injured limb should abstain from walking for forty days.
If he desires to walk before this period, it is not safe that the jaw may give way and become ineffective, nor will treatment be accepted thereafter. If a hot swelling appears, it is advisable to use what we have described for pain relief in another part of the treatment and application until it subsides.
The Fourth Thirty-Fourth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Jaw Dislocation of the Finger.
It should be straightened what has dislocated from it with a gentle stretch. This is not difficult but easy. If the jaw is in one of the bones at the back of the foot, it should be made that the injured limb's foot rests on a level surface of the ground.
Or on a board and standing like a walker, then stand you placing your foot where we mentioned from those joints, then press it with your foot firmly until it returns and you see that it has aligned and there is no displacement in the place.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot, taking the whole foot, and let it have two ends. Then tighten and secure it firmly for three days. Afterwards, loosen it and protect it from walking for many days until it strengthens and you may fear the return [of the dislocation] if Allah wills.
The Thirty-Fifth Chapter.
On Kinds of Jaw Injury That May Occur with a Wound or a Fracture or Both Together.
When any of this occurs and you treat it and set it, it often results in death.
For this reason, it should not be undertaken to treat such a case except by one who is skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, patient, neither rash nor bold. And at first, only the medicines that calm hot swellings should be used, and the healthy should be allowed to recover on their own.
For this reason, O Lord, except what I hope will be safe from disease with a mild illness and where you have shown some hope in it, return him to me at the very beginning before the hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns as desired, use the treatment that calms hot swellings and treat the wound with ointments suitable for it. If the jaw is broken and there are shards of bone protruding, extract them. And complied with that which we mentioned in the simple diseases as stated before regarding their locations.
And strive to the utmost and purify yourself from entering the way of risk as stated before. I have advised you of this, for it will benefit you in your efforts and make your situation easier with the will of Allah.
