of the dislocation of the shoulder	On the reduction of a dislocation of the humerus.	0.49773416
Know that the shoulder can only be dislocated in three ways: one of which is that it dislocates downwards towards the armpit; and the second is towards the breast; and sometimes it dislocates upwards, but this happens rarely; and it does not dislocate backwards because of the shoulder blade, and it does not dislocate inwards because of the nerves; and it often dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in them it slips out easily; in those who have enough flesh, it dislocates with difficulty, and is reduced with difficulty.	You should know that there are three ways in which the humerus may be dislocated. One is a dislocation down into the axilla, another is a dislocation toward the breast; it may also be dislocated upward, which is rare. It is not dislocated backward, because of the scapula; nor is it dislocated forward, on account of the tendons. Mostly it is dislocated and displaced down into the axilla, and particularly in those of a spare build; in such it quickly comes out and quickly goes back.	0.8782434
And sometimes it happens to some men that they receive a blow or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think it is dislocated because of this.	Sometimes a man suffers a blow or a fall, so that the upper arm swells up with an effusion, whence he forms the opinion that there is a dislocation.	0.76168454
You must therefore examine it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.	So you must examine it to make sure of it and then proceed to treat it.	0.865415
And the method is that the practitioner raises the patient's hand upwards, then puts their fists under the armpit, and forcefully lifts the joint upwards into place; and the practitioner raises the hand, and extends it upwards, then brings it downwards; it will return quickly.	To reduce it, his hand should be lifted up by an assistant, then you should put both your thumbs under his axilla and lift the joint up powerfully into its place, while the assistant lifts and stretches his hand upward; then he puts it down and the dislocation will at once go back.	0.74685353
And if it does not return as we have said within a few days, then the patient should be bathed in hot water; and the practitioner should apply softening and soothing poultices, such as a decoction of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water; then the patient should lie on their back, and a pad of wool, even, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit, then the practitioner puts their heel on the pad, and skillfully lifts the head of the shoulder, and pulls the patient's hand; and another practitioner holds the patient's head, so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you wish, reduce it in this way: have a man present who is larger than the patient; and he should stand straight at the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another practitioner pulls the patient's hand down towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation will return immediately. And it can also be reduced in another way: a long stick is driven into the ground, the head of which should be as round as a pestle, and neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but with soft cloths on top, and the patient lies along the length of the wood; then their hand is extended downwards strongly on the other side, and the joint will quickly return to its place; and if it does not want to return after all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a stick two cubits long and four fingers wide, which has a round end to be able to enter deep under the armpit, in this way:	Then the patient should lie on his back and you put under his axilla a ball of wool of moderately hard consistency. Then the doctor should put his heel on the ball and grasp the patient's hand and draw it downward, while pushing the ball with his foot, and it will straightway be reduced. Or, if you prefer, reduce it in this way: get a man taller than the patient to stand on one side and pass his shoulder under the patient's axilla and lift it up until the patient is suspended in mid-air, while another assistant pulls the patient's hand down towards his lower abdomen (if the patient is light it will be necessary to hang a weight from him); then the dislocation will straightway be reduced. It is also reduced by another method: that is, to fix in.	0.8167548
Then tie soft cloths over the end of the stick so that the stick does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit; and extend their arm along the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm at the end of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder lengthwise, and the hand should be extended downwards, and the body left hanging on the other side: the joint will go back in immediately.	Then you bind on the round head soft rags so that the wood will not hurt the patient. Then it is placed under the patient's axilla, and his whole hand and arm are stretched down over the spar, which is to be bound down to the upper arm, the forearm, and the tip of the hand. Then let the arm be placed cross-wise over the rung of a ladder and the hand stretched downward, and let the rest of the body hang down on the other side; then the joint will very quickly go back.	0.88646674
And when it is in, in whatever way, you must place a ball of wool evenly under the armpit, then apply the prepared plaster of mill dust, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then tighten it suitably under the armpit, and wrap the bandage over the plaster, and bind the arm to their neck, and the arm should remain like this.	Once it has gone back properly, in whatever way is possible, there should be put under the axilla a ball of wool of moderate size; then apply the plaster prepared from mill-dust with olibanum and egg-white, all round the shoulder. Then firmly bandage the ball under the axilla and carry the bandaging round over the plaster.	0.80186987
And they should eat little, until the limb is strengthened, because it will heal faster; and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not soft, then it is healed.	The patient's diet should be light until the limb gets strong, for that will hasten the cure. After five or seven days it can be unfastened and he can make trial of its movement; if it is firm and not slack then it is healed.	0.7994379
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come there, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries with three holes, as described above in the chapter on cauteries.	If the joint is frequently dislocated, on account of a humidity arising in it or some other cause, then use should be made of the cautery with three prongs spoken of earlier, in the book on cauterizations.	0.77076256
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and they cannot lift their arm up, then know that the nerves at the top of the shoulder are cut or stretched or weakened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.	If you do all this and loosen the bandaging after a week and the joint is still not firm, and you repeatedly plaster it and bandage it, and it is still loose and comes down and dislocates and you are unable to raise it up, then you may know that the tendons at the head of the humerus are either cut through or stretched or loosened; in which case you may know that the joint will never stay firm in its place.	0.8271177
The dislocation which is towards the chest, and the breasts, or behind, is caused by a push, and stretching of the hands, and another bandage is applied there; and treat it until it is healed.	As to the dislocation toward the chest and breast, and posteriorly, the reduction of this is done by thrusting and extension with both hands until it goes back. And apply the usual bandaging and treatment until it is healed.	0.7518904
And if after healing, stiffness comes to the limb, and slowness in movement, the patient should use baths many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and it returns to its original nature.	If, after it has healed, a callosity arises in it, and it is slow in movement, the patient should take frequent hot baths until that callosity is softened and the member returns to its original condition.	0.801806
