If someone develops a boil and it is slow to mature, either because of the matter causing it, or because of the patient's age if he is old and has little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the boil's maturation, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, dotting it.	When a person gets a boil which is slow in coming to a head, either because of the superfluity causing it, or because of the patient's age if he be an elderly man lacking in blood, or because of the season, and you wish to hasten the ripening of the boil, then make a punctate burn around it with multiple small cauterizations, and then let be; it will speedily come to a head.	0.8723835

And apply it to the middle of the boil until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be on the lower side so that the pus can flow easily. Then treat it as appropriate until it heals.	Apply it to the middle of the boil till it has pierced the skin. The cauterization should go right to the bottom to facilitate the flow of pus. Then dress till cured.	0.8496531
