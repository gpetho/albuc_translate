On the Fracture of the Woman's Vulva, the Pubic Bone, and the Man's Penis.	On fracture of the female pudenda and of the pubic bone and of the male organ.	0.8449183
When a woman's vulva is fractured, have her sit cross-legged, then lean her back little by little, and have her held from behind. Then the midwife should pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball in her vulva.	When a woman's pudenda are fractured, make her sit cross-legged, then bend her backwards little by little, being supported from behind. Then let a midwife pack the vulva with cotton wool so as to form a kind of spherical packing in the vulva.	0.89769125
Then the woman is shaken and her back is raised little by little, so that the cotton comes out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the broken bone is returned to its place. Then a pad is placed on her back, and when she wants to urinate, the cotton is removed gently so she can urinate.	Then shake the woman and by degrees elevate the dorsal spine, for the cotton wool will emerge until it is like a sphere at the opening and the fractured bone will be reduced. Then put a pillow upon her back and when she wants to pass water gently remove the cotton wool so she may do so, then put it back in the same way in which it was put in at the first.	0.84258276
It is returned in the way it was first inserted, then she returns to her original padding. This is done for seven days or so, and it will heal.  And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, attach a reed tube to its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.	Then she should return to her pillow as before. She should do this for about seven days, then it will be mended. If you prefer, take a sheep's bladder and bind a hollow reed to the opening of it; introduce the whole bladder into the pudenda and then blow hard into the tube so that the bladder is inflated within the passage and the fracture will then be reduced.	0.85457426
Then blow strongly into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will return to place. Then pack it with cotton and continue as we have described for several days until it heals.  As for when the pubic bone is fractured in a man or woman, the following is used in its repair.	Then pack with cotton wool and let her wait a few days as we have described, until it be healed. Now when a man or woman has the pubic bone broken you can use for the setting and repair of it the method we gave for a fracture of the hip.	0.7397746
Its reduction and alignment are as we described for the hip bone.  The correct procedure in these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, will not be hidden from you, especially for someone with some experience and who understands this book of mine well, because the fracture itself will guide you in most cases.	The correct practice in these uncommon fractures, which very rarely happen, will be obvious, especially to one who has some experience and understands well this book of mine. For the fracture itself will in most cases indicate the correct way to repair it and bind it up, so use your intelligence.	0.8045176
on the correct way to reduce and bind it, so understand. As for the penis of a man, if it is fractured, take the trachea of a goose, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it, and bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.	When a man's organ is fractured, take a goose's neck and introduce the penis into it; then let it be wrapped and bandaged and left for about three days until it be healed.	0.7349233
