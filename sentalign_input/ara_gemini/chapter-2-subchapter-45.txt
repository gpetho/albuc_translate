Chapter forty-five, on fissuring in different kinds of goods/commodities.
Merchandise has many types, and I have mentioned all of its types in the classification.
And it is necessary that we explain here the difference between merchandise and abscess, as it is problematic.
So I say that with an abscess there is heat, fever, and frightening pains until the boiling of the excess subsides and the putrefaction is complete, at which point the fever and the acuteness subside.
With merchandise, there is neither heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it is contained in a peritoneal sac that is its special container, and it is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a duck, and bigger and smaller, and it is of two types, either fatty or it contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the classification.
So, when you come to treat merchandise, it is appropriate to probe and examine it first with the instrument called the probe, as its image comes in the chapter after this.
The method for examining all tumors and merchandise is that you take this instrument and insert it in the softest place you find in the tumor while you rotate your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin, then press your hand according to the size of the tumor.
Then take out the probe and look at what comes out after it. If flowing moisture comes out, whatever color it may be, then incise it with a simple incision as I mentioned in other tumors. And if no moisture comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty, so incise it with a hardened incision in this way, as I have taught you.
And hang it with hooks, and skin the skin from each side gently, and preserve the sac if you are able to remove it intact with the merchandise.
If the sac ruptures during the procedure and you are unable to remove it intact, this happens often, so remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it, because if something remains of it, little or much, the merchandise will mostly return.
If it overcomes you and a little of it remains, cauterize the wound when you are finished with some sharp, corrosive peaks, and tighten the wound and place over it something that soothes the hot tumor, and treat it with other treatments until it heals.
If the merchandise is large, then stitch its lips and treat it with what heals.
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vein and bleeding occurs, immediately cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it tight for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides, then return to cutting what remains of the merchandise.
