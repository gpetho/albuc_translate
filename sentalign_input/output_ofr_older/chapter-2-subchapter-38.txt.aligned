And let the instrument be curved at the end so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the end raised; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, so the cough does not occur, nor push the bone in; and better that the patient inserts the instrument, as he knows where the object is; then push it down, or pull it out evenly with the instrument, until it is out.	The patient himself should introduce it into his own throat gently; he should raise the head backwards and take care not to touch the larynx lest coughing be aroused. And let him remove therewith the bone or sharp body. Or else let the doctor introduce it with his hand (although it is better if the patient himself introduce it, since he knows the site of the obstruction) and push it down and then draw up his hand with the instrument; all this according to the way it presents itself to him, till it is removed.	0.81427765
