About the pus in the eye
This disease called "alcunnati" is nothing but pus that accumulates in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not water; and the way to identify it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take his head between your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the pus come to the surface in your eyes; then if it is fixed, and does not descend, and the light is clear, and the patient sees things as usual; and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the pus is not prepared as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands, then take the delicate spatula and cut a little on the corneal tissue along the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tissue and the cornea, until the pus comes out; and when it is out, then distill warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or water in which fenugreek is boiled with honey, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
