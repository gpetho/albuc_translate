Chapter 47.
On the treatment of menâ€™s breasts which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell due to the growth of hair as they begin to become hairy, and the breasts swell, resembling those of women, and remain abscessed, distant.
And for those who have this, it is necessary to cut them with a lunar incision in this form, from line .B. to line .G., then scrape all the thickness, then fill the wound with healing medication, then join the two lips of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the breast sags downward and is softened due to its size, like that of women, then it should be split in two upper parts, with two cuts resembling a lunar shape, each containing the other at the end, so that the larger line contains the smaller one in this form from line .B. to line .G. Then scrape the skin between the two lips of the wound, remove the fat, and apply what we said about stitching and powders necessary for the healing until it is cured.
And if you cannot complete the incision because of the patient's restlessness and the blood flow, then fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it there until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
