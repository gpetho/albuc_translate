Chapter Twenty-Two on the Treatment of Broken Bones if They Are Set Crooked And its action was prevented as it should be.	CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO. On the treatment of fractured bones when they mend crooked and are inhibited from their proper functioning.	0.80729467
So when a limb that has been set after its healing exhibits a curvature or a protrusion of the broken bone, or a knotting, and the appearance of the limb is thus disfigured, but the limb is not prevented from its natural function. Then it is not appropriate to accept the statement of someone who claims to break the limb again, although many of the ignorant physicians and bone-setters do that in our country, and this action is very reprehensible, leading to great harm, the least of which is damage.	When a limb that has been set has some distortion after healing, or the bone that was broken has some prominence or callosity, so that the limb is deformed, but there is nevertheless no limitation of its natural movement, then you should not listen to those who think that the bone should be broken again. In our parts there have been many ignorant doctors and bone-setters who have done this. The operation is most blameworthy and leads to great dangers, death itself not being the worst possibility.	0.859
But if the curvature and knotting are soft, then it should be fomented with water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and so on, and it should be dressed with softening dressings such as well-made diachylon.	But if the distortion and callosity be recent you should massage it with an infusion of the herbs that have an emollient quality, such as leaves and roots of the marsh mallow, and melilot and the like: and apply one of the emollient plasters such as carefully prepared diachylon.	0.83414745
Or marshmallow root mucilage should be taken and mixed with chicken fat and sesame oil, and it should be dressed with it.	Or take mucilage of the root of the marsh mallow and beat it up with chicken fat and oil of sesame, and let a cataplasm of these be applied.	0.82500327
Or fatty figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon dung, and similar medications that are called dissolvers of healing.	Or take a fat fig and beat it up with pigeon's dung; and the like remedies that are termed 'inhibitors of scarring'.	0.7974264
And the knotting may be dissolved by constant gentle massage done with the hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.	Sometimes also the callosity is resolved by long-continued gentle friction with the hands; and constant movement in every direction should also be applied.	0.7428851
But if the curvature is old and severe and hardened, and necessity calls for its treatment with iron, then it should be incised at its top and the connection of the bone should be released, and the excess of knotting or bone should be cut with gentle cuts, and gentleness should be employed in this with effort and care.	But if the deformity be long-standing and fixed and hardened and you are compelled to treat it operatively, you will have to cut down on it from above, and free the junction of the bone, and with fine chisels cut away the redundant callus or bone; be gentle in this, with diligence and care.	0.8567292
Then the wound should be treated with what has been mentioned previously until it heals.	Then treat the wound with the means previously described until it heals.	0.90397537
