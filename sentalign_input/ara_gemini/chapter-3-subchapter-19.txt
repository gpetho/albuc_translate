Chapter nineteen on the reduction of bone fractures if they are with a wound.
It is advisable for one who has experienced a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus or similar, to immediately phlebotomize him at the time, if the conditions for phlebotomy are met, as we have previously mentioned.
If the wound is bleeding, then you should hasten to stop it by sprinkling powdered vitriol on it, if you have nothing else available.
Then proceed to set the fracture on that very same day and do not delay it unless a hot swelling occurs.
If a hot swelling occurs, leave the setting of the fracture until the ninth day until the hot swelling subsides, and do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for bad symptoms may arise.
If the broken bone is protruding from the skin and exposed, you should attempt to reduce and align it with your hands gently and with a slight extension.
If you are unable to reduce and align it with your hands, then reduce it with this instrument, which is an instrument made of iron, its length being about seven or eight fingers and its width according to the size of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should acquire three or four of them, according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture.
And let it be rounded with a slight thickness so that it does not bend when pressed upon during the operation, and let it have a sharp end with a hook at its tip, its upper part being thick and from its middle to the bottom very thin.
And this is its image:
And it is called in Greek "peron" meaning a small lever.
It is necessary that its sharp, curved end be placed on the protruding end of the bone, and push it with it at once, so that when the bone returns and is somewhat leveled, then level the ends of the fracture on each other.
If its broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, it is necessary to cut the end of that bone so that the instrument can grip it.
If you are absolutely unable to reduce the bone with what we have described, then cut it with something similar to the cutters that we mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws however you can.
Then scrape off what remains on the bone of roughness and thin scales.
If you reduce the bone and the patient finds, after its reduction, severe and harmful pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient.
When you have completed your setting of the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if you are in the summer, and do not put on the wound a cerate nor anything containing fat, lest putrefaction and corruption occur in it.
Then use splints when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors according to the size of the wound, and beware, with all caution, of tightening the wound with the fracture, for ignorant doctors often do that, causing their patients either death or gangrene or inflammation; and let your tightening be gentle and relaxed, unlike the tightening of the rest of the fracture.
If the wound is bad, or it is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms that we have described, and he finds disturbing pain in the place, it is not necessary to put splints on it; make for it bandages of hard cloths in the place of the splints and tighten it with them.
If it is after a day or two and you see that pus has begun to generate in the wound, remove the cloth that you put on it with the drink, then use the threads and ointments that we are accustomed to treat wounds with, such as the quadruple ointment and the like.
It is necessary for you to loosen the bandage and inspect the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals and recovers.
It is necessary to position the limb in a way that the pus flows down from it easily.
If many days pass for the wound and it does not heal and the pus does not stop from it, know that there are small bone fragments there, so it is necessary to search the wound with a probe, and whatever of those fragments are loose, extract and remove them, and whatever of them are not loose and are pricking the limb and causing pain, then cut and extract them in every way you can.
If inflammation or gangrene or another type of corruption and putrefaction occurs to the wound, it is necessary to address each symptom of it with something similar to the treatment that was previously described in its chapter.
And among what you should pay attention to my words and keep in mind is if a large bone breaks and protrudes from the limb, such as the femur bone, the humerus bone, and the like of the large limbs, do not attempt to pull it or remove it, for death often results from that, rather leave it until it putrefies, for it may fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days, then at that time treat the wound if you see a place for treatment in it, otherwise leave it.
