Chapter ninety-three, on incising the illness that is known as an abscess.
This disease, which is called "al-nafir" in our country, is a pain that occurs in some of the limbs, then moves from one limb to another, and I have seen it as I describe it to you.
I was called to a sick woman in one of the rural areas, and she uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in the vein of the forearm, and after an hour passed I saw that swelling crawling along the ulna as a worm crawls, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as could be, like mercury when it flows from place to place.
So the pain went away from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran throughout the body until it went into the other arm.
Then she told me that it goes around her whole body as I saw, so I marveled at the speed of its movement from limb to limb, and I had not previously seen this disease with my own eyes in this manner except that I saw a group of people who experience the pain moving from limb to limb, but I hadn't seen it with my own eyes like I saw it in this woman. I did not estimate that except that it must be because the woman was from the Bedouins, having a dry body and exposed veins, so from this, that moving wind became apparent to the senses, and it necessarily does not appear in this manner in those of comfort with moist bodies and hidden veins.
So if you want to treat it and its possessor feels the pain, if it appears to you visibly as we mentioned, then tie tightly above it and below it with haste and incise upon it until that trapped wind comes out and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by shaking the body and with that which expels the winds and disperses them, such as asafoetida seeds and sagapenum seeds and similar medications.
