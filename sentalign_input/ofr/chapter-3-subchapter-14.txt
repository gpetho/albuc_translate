of the broken thigh
The thigh bone is often broken, and it is clearly visible when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is such that one ties one bandage above the break, and another below.
And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends his bandage on his side equally;
and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is near the top of the thigh, let one of the bandages be towards the buttock, and the other bandage below the break.
And also if it is near the knee, then let the bandage be next to the knee, and the extension be downwards;
then the physician sets the bone straight with his two hands, until it is in its natural shape, and then applies the plaster, and bandages it, if no abscess develops.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside then return to your work and your treatment;
The binding is done in this way.
You must wrap a hard bandage, doubled in two or three, over the fracture, leaving the excess, then bend the leg so that the heel comes to the base of the buttock, and place a long thread between the thigh and the leg, next to the knee underneath, and bring the ends of the thread to the top;
then turn the bandage over the leg and the thigh, then place splints on the fracture, and place a splint on the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to even out the pressure, then begin to tie tightly three or four turns over the fracture;
and the higher you go above the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then pull on the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie the three splints that are on top, then go back down to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like that, until no abscess, swelling, or other similar thing appears.
And if it does occur, untie it, and address what appears there, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that stick out, you must remove them, if possible;
and if not, then it is necessary to cut into the area and pull them out;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are put on it, just as with the shoulder and the arm;
however, in a restoration done this way, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, according to the differences in complexions.
