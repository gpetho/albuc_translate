Preface.
After I completed for you, O sons, this book, which is the final one in medical science, along with its supplements, and I reached its end with its explanations and clarifications, it seemed fitting to me to complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of practice, that is, surgery by hand.
Since the practice of manual surgery has fallen in our region, and in our time has been almost entirely lost, until perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and its traces were cut off. Only small descriptions of it remain in the books of the ancients, altered by other hands, where errors and confusion have arisen, until its purposes became closed off and its efficacy weakened. It seemed to me fitting to bring it back to life with the organization of this Treatise, following the way of exposition, clarification, and abbreviation, and to include the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the practice, with explanations added and with the necessary urgency.
The reason why a skilled practitioner in this art with his own hand is not found in our time is because the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen, until he knows the functions of the parts, their forms, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, and their numbers and origins, as well as of the veins, both pulsating and still, and the places of their exits.
And because of this, Hippocrates said that name with name is plentiful, but with practice it is scarce, especially in the art of the hand.
We have already spoken of this in the introduction of this book.
For anyone who does not know what we have said about anatomy is not immune from error, an error by which people are killed, as I have seen many of those who are trained in this science and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
For instance, I saw a foolish physician who cut into a scrofulous abscess on a woman’s neck and severed certain arteries in her neck, causing her blood to flow until she died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from an older man, and the stone was large.
He therefore reached the stone and extracted it along with a piece of the bladder.
Thus the man died on the third day.
And I had been called to extract the stone myself, but I saw from the size of the stone and the patient’s condition that he would die.
And I saw another physician who took payment from a certain Duke of our land for his practice, and a black eunuch under his care suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel. The physician, in his ignorance, rushed and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and tight splints, not allowing the wound to breathe.
Then he discharged him according to his own wishes.
Afterwards, he left him for several days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage, and so it remained until his leg and foot became infected, resulting in ruin.
I was therefore called to him, and I hurried to loosen the bandage, and peace followed, and he was freed from his pains.
Nevertheless, the decay in the limb was already set in, and I could not halt it.
Thus, the decay ceased to spread through the limb until it perished.
And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated after several days, until its malignancy grew along with the suffering of its owner.
This is because, when cancer is purely from a melancholic humor, it must never be treated with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can endure having the entire affected area excised.
And therefore, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that manual operation is divided into two categories: namely, operations associated with safety, and operations that involve danger in many conditions.
And I have already pointed out in every place in this book where there is an operation involving terror and fear.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to be cautious of such things and to avoid them, so that fools do not find a reason to speak and dishonor the profession.
Therefore, approach with care and protection, and treat your patients with gentleness and firmness, using the best method, guided by the grace of God toward health and praiseworthy outcomes; and avoid terrible illnesses that are difficult to heal; and keep your souls from things that cause you fear, lest hesitation should enter your faith and your practice.
For this will be of greater benefit to your glory, and will elevate you more in this world, and ultimately increase your honor.
Galen has already said in certain of his teachings:
Do not treat a malignant disease, lest you be called a poor physician.
Now, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters. ¶
Chapter One.
On cauterization with fire, and cauterization with sharp medicines, arranged chapter by chapter, and organized from head to foot, with the forms of instruments and cautery tools, and everything necessary for practice. ¶
Chapter Two.
On cutting and piercing, bloodletting, cupping, and wounds; and on extracting arrows, and things similar to these; all arranged chapter by chapter and organized with the forms of instruments. ¶
Chapter Three.
On restoration, dislocation, and treatment of twisting and similar injuries; arranged chapter by chapter from head to foot, with the forms of instruments.
