Sometimes an abscess occurs in a fleshy place, and stays so long that it gathers a lot of pus;
and then it bursts and pierces, and the pus comes out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel;
and the skin above it is as thin as a delicate cloth,
and it does not reach the bone, nor the nerve, and such a disease is called "sain" (healthy),
and is not called "fistula";
but if it is so prolonged that it reaches the bone deeply, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut around that skin, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth;
and it does not adhere because of its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will adhere, and the corruption is not deep,
and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a poultice like this:
see if the abscess is large, and the pus that comes out is of a foul odor,
then treat it with Egyptian medicine made like this:
take garlic, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put them to cook in a vessel on the fire,
until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take as much as needed, and melt it in water and honey,
and treat the abscess, and tighten the opening;
and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the abscess is clean, and the odor is gone;
and sometimes it is treated with lye water,
when this medicine is not available, and it is that you take ashes from vine wood, and pour water over them,
then strain it, and use it as a poultice, until you know the abscess is well cleaned;
and if the patient cannot endure it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the lye water,
then treat it with water and honey where a little crushed litharge is added;
or treat it with honey and mixed wine, as honey has the property to cleanse and wash,
and the wine makes the abscess adhere;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the abscess is well cleaned,
then treat it with what makes flesh grow in it,
and it is that you take a plaster of diafinit, and melt it with rose oil and in wine;
or treat it with some medicines and ointments, whose properties I have mentioned in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the abscess is small, and the tube of the poultice cannot enter,
then widen it a little with an iron, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment,
or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too wide, then sew it and leave only one place where the poultice can enter,
and if the opening that discharges pus is above, then cut it to a lower place.
Because when the pus is deep, it does not let flesh grow there;
and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish,
then prepare in such a way that the pus flows to the lowest place it is,
because when the pus is deep, it does not let flesh grow there
and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish,
then prepare in such a way that the pus flows easily down, and leave nothing of the pus;
and take consolidating medicines to put on the abscess,
and spread a linen cloth over it that covers the whole abscess;
then cut with scissors at the opening of the abscess a little wider than the first,
then spread a gentle ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening,
and put it on the opening of the abscess to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except once after many days;
and the one that is on the opening of the abscess, remove often to remove the pus,
and know what flows from the pus, if it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take note if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not,
and when your medicine has been spread in this way and you see the nature rising on the opening of the abscess,
then know that the abscess is adhering, and health is approaching;
and then untie it in the morning, or the third day, and when you untie the wound,
then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if the abscess discharges undigested pus after many days, know that the abscess is not adhering.
And if subtle venoms flow after a long time, do not despair of health,
because health is approaching. Because there are men whose flesh growth in their wounds is delayed, and those who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus comes out of the abscess after many days, know that the abscess is not adhering;
and if the abscess is slow to adhere, and is prolonged, then add drying medicines moist in substance and dry in virtue,
like diafinit ointment, because it has a large part of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
take diafinit ointment, and melt it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with old wine equally;
then confit it and use it; and the same does well-cooked honey,
when diafinit ointment is not available,
or take myrrh and aloe and incense, and grind it, and powder it on the honey when it is on the fire;
and then glue a cloth, and spread it on the abscess, and sometimes administer aristolochia,
and roots of celestial lily, which is like flour of vetches and centaury;
and use it in simple or compound forms: grind them, and make powder, and put it on the honey as I said, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment,
then know that the corruption is deep, and affects the bone, or the hard members, or the joints;
then treat it as a fistula, as we have said before.
