and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are spread in the flesh, and therefore one does not weaken from it, as one does from bloodletting from a vein; and it should not be administered, neither with fire nor without fire, in any illness that comes from plethora, until the whole body is emptied.	What cupping does is to draw blood out of the fine vessels dispersed over the flesh; for this reason it does not cause the strength to decline as does venesection; nor may you use cupping, either with fire or without fire, in any disease due to plethora, until the whole body has been evacuated.	0.8689455

The cups that are applied without scarification are those that are placed over the liver, and over the spleen, and for gout, and over the belly and the buttock and the loins and the hip, because these parts do not tolerate being cut over the skin, and it is only done to draw blood from one part to another, as we place them on the breasts when the nose bleeds;	Cupping without scarification is the cupping practised on the liver, the spleen, the breasts, the belly, the umbilicus, the region of the kidneys and the acetabulum of the femur; for these parts do not tolerate scarification.	0.65730786
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, as we put cups on the belly and on the buttock to reduce the limb;	Now the purpose of the vessels is either to draw blood from one part to another, as when we apply cups over the breasts in the case of nose-bleed; or to loosen from the part a frigid vapour that has become fixed in it, as when we place cupping-vessels on the abdomen and umbilicus; for they stimulate the part and warm it and remove the pain because they loosen the vapour.	0.47479525

and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be over the hole that we mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cupping glass;	Then the vessel should be placed on the part with the finger kept over the above-mentioned hole; then when we have held the vessel sufficiently long there the finger is taken away, the vapour will come out through the hole, and the vessel will become loosened at once.	0.71873605
