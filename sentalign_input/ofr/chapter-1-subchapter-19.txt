of the abscess of the throat
When an abscess comes at the base of the throat or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, afterwards it causes rotting and pus and becomes chronic and becomes a fistula;
and you treat it as we have described in divisions, and it is not effective:
then you must have a cautery according to the size of the fistula;
after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand steady so that the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and to the furthest point;
and do this once or twice, then treat it with what we have described in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, that is good;
and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
