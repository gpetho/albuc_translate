The seventh chapter on cauterizing chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you have treated it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment has not been successful, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations, one on each side of his head.
And a cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have mentioned.
And a cauterization at the back of the head, as has been stated previously.
And the description of the cauteries is as previously mentioned.
And he may also be cauterized at the pit of the stomach, which would be more effective.
Then treat with what has been previously mentioned.
