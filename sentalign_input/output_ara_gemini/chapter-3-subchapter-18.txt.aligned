Chapter Eighteen on the fracture of the woman's clitoris and the pubic bone and the man's penis.	CHAPTER EIGHTEEN. On fracture of the female pudenda and of the pubic bone and of the male organ.	0.89059305
When a woman's vulva is fractured, sit her cross-legged, then bend her slightly towards her back, and let someone hold her from behind. Then the midwife should pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball in her vulva. Then shake the woman and lift her back slightly, so that the cotton comes out until it is at the entrance of the vulva like a ball and the bone fracture returns to place.	When a woman's pudenda are fractured, make her sit cross-legged, then bend her backwards little by little, being supported from behind. Then let a midwife pack the vulva with cotton wool so as to form a kind of spherical packing in the vulva. Then shake the woman and by degrees elevate the dorsal spine, for the cotton wool will emerge until it is like a sphere at the opening and the fractured bone will be reduced.	0.89250755
Then place a support on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton gently until she urinates and return it in the same way you inserted it first. Then she returns to her initial support.	Then put a pillow upon her back and when she wants to pass water gently remove the cotton wool so she may do so, then put it back in the same way in which it was put in at the first. Then she should return to her pillow as before.	0.85926807
Do this for seven days or so, and it will heal.	She should do this for about seven days, then it will be mended.	0.7922771
If you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tie a reed tube to its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva, then blow strongly into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will return to place.	If you prefer, take a sheep's bladder and bind a hollow reed to the opening of it; introduce the whole bladder into the pudenda and then blow hard into the tube so that the bladder is inflated within the passage and the fracture will then be reduced.	0.83627105
Then pack it with cotton and stay for days as we described until it heals.	Then pack with cotton wool and let her wait a few days as we have described, until it be healed.	0.9398415
As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, use what we described for the hip bone to repair and straighten it.	Now when a man or woman has the pubic bone broken you can use for the setting and repair of it the method we gave for a fracture of the hip.	0.8321073
The correct approach in these strange fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone with some experience who understands this book of mine well, should not be hidden from you, because the fracture itself in most cases guides you to the correct way to repair and tighten it, so understand.	The correct practice in these uncommon fractures, which very rarely happen, will be obvious, especially to one who has some experience and understands well this book of mine. For the fracture itself will in most cases indicate the correct way to repair it and bind it up, so use your intelligence.	0.8628842
As for a man's penis, if it is fractured, take the gullet of a goose and insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth on it and bind it and leave it for three days or so until it heals.	When a man's organ is fractured, take a goose's neck and introduce the penis into it; then let it be wrapped and bandaged and left for about three days until it be healed.	0.85254276
