Chapter ninety-four on removing arrows.	CHAPTER NINETY-FOUR. On the extraction of arrows.	0.82128644
Arrows may differ according to their types and according to the places in which they are located in the body.	Arrows vary both as to types and as to the different parts of the body pierced by them.	0.7900866
As for their differences according to their types, there are large ones and small ones, and there are hollow glass ones and solid glass ones, and some have three corners and four corners, and some have tongues and some have splinters.	They differ thus as to type: some are big and some are small; some with hollow heads and some with solid; some of them have three angles and some four; some have tongues; some have spikes.	0.8519856
And of the signs of the brain, if an arrow hits it and penetrates the bone and wounds the peritoneum which is on the brain, then there results from that a severe headache, nausea, dizziness, redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting, and sometimes blood comes out of the nostrils or ears, and sometimes speech is cut off and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling porridge comes out of the place of the wound and a liquid like the water of the flesh flows from it.	Now the signs when the arrow has struck the brain, and penetrated the bone and injured the meninges covering the brain, are these: there arise from that a violent headache and vertigo and giddiness and a redness in the eye, and a redness of the tongue, and convulsion and mental confusion and bilious vomit; perhaps also blood comes out of the nose or from the ears; often also the speech is affected and the voice is lost; also there comes out of the site of the wound a white fluid which resembles gruel, from which there flows something like the juice of meat.	0.87113214
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not come out.	If you observe these signs, avoid treating the patient and extraction of the arrow if it has not come out.	0.94820267
As for the signs of the arrow if it hits the heart and is close to the left breast and feels as if it has been driven into something solid and not into something empty, and perhaps the arrow has a movement resembling the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and this is followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting, then know that death is certainly coming.	The signs of an arrow in the heart are: nearness to the left breast; the patient feels it as if it were fixed in something solid, not hollow; often also there will be imparted to the arrow a pulsating movement; and black blood will issue from the wound; and after this follow coldness of the extremities and a cold sweat and unconsciousness; then you may know that death is surely on its way.	0.82917166
And a sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels which are next to the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes, and he breathes heavily and asks to inhale cold air.	The sign of an arrow that has wounded the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound; also the vessels that lie along the neck swell up and the patient changes colour, breathes heavily, and seeks to inhale fresh air very strongly.	0.8678942
If the arrow hits the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it is close to the small ribs, and the breathing is great with severe pain and sighing, and all the members of the shoulders move.	But if the arrow strike the pleura then it will be close to the small ribs and he will breathe deeply with much pain and heaving of the chest, and all parts of his shoulders will be agitated.	0.7910448
And if the arrow hits the liver, severe pain follows, and blood comes out of the wound which resembles the liver in its redness.	If the arrow hits the liver, there ensues violent pain, and blood flows from the wound, resembling the liver in its redness.	0.91750884
And if the arrow hits the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food comes out of the wound, and the matter is clear.	If the arrow strikes the stomach, often undigested food comes out of the wound and renders the case obvious.	0.7891512
And if the arrow hits the abdomen and is stuck in it and something from the stool, or the fat, or an intestine which has been perforated comes out of the wound, then there is no hope in treating it or in removing the arrow.	If the arrow wounds the belly and is fixed in it, and from the wound there comes excrement or omentum or torn bowel, there is no hope in treatment nor in extracting the arrow.	0.8570765
If the arrow is in the bladder and the urine comes out and something protrudes from it to the outside and the pain intensifies on the patient, then know that he is doomed.	If the arrow has hit the urinary bladder, and urine comes out and some of the bladder protrudes and the patient has violent pain, then you may know that the wound is mortal.	0.83171386
As for the other organs, like the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, thigh, leg, and the like of the organs, they are usually saved when the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve and the arrow is not poisoned.	But as for the other parts, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, dorsal vertebrae, collar-bone, hip, leg, and the like, in most cases they will heal if the arrow does not happen to strike an artery or nerve, and if the arrow is not poisoned.	0.89524245
And I tell you some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may deduce from that your treatment.	Now I will relate to you certain cases of arrow wounds that I have seen, so that you may be guided thereby to your own methods of treatment.	0.7865747
That is, an arrow had hit a man in the corner of his eye at the root of the nose, so I removed it for him from the other side under the lobe of the ear, and he healed and no harm occurred in his eye.	For example, once an arrow struck a man at the corner of his eye near the root of the nose, and I extracted it from him on the other side beneath the lobe of his ear, and he got well, and his eye was none the worse.	0.84647655
And I removed another arrow for a Jew that had struck him in the lobe of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had hidden, and I only reached the small end that adheres to the wood, and it was a large arrow from the arrows of the compound bow, square iron, smooth, and there were no barbs on it, so the Jew healed and no bad incident occurred in his eye.	Also I extracted from a Jew another arrow that had pierced the orbit beneath the lower eyelid; the arrow had sunk out of sight and I could take hold only of the tiny extremity of it which is secured to the shaft; but it was a big arrow from a compound bow, the iron tip four-sided, very smooth without barbs. The Jew recovered, nor did any ill befall his eye.	0.88947
And I removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was an Arabian one, which is the one that has two barbs, so I made an incision on him between the jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat, so I gently handled it until I removed it, and the Christian was saved and healed.	I also extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian. It was an Arab arrow, one of those with two barbs; and I cut down upon it between the two jugulars (for it lay deep in the throat), and worked gently at it until I extracted it; and the Christian was saved and recovered.	0.9343496
And I removed another arrow from a man who had been hit in his abdomen, and we estimated that he would die from it, but when he remained for thirty days or so and nothing changed in his condition, I made an incision on the arrow and maneuvered it and removed it, and he healed and no bad incident occurred.	I also extracted another arrow from a man, that had struck him in the abdomen, and our opinion was that he would certainly die from it. But when it had remained in him for the space of thirty days or thereabouts, and his condition was unimpaired, I cut down upon the arrow and manoeuvred it out and extracted it; and he recovered, nor did any harm befall him.	0.9327704
And I saw a man who had been hit by an arrow in his back, and the wound healed over him, but when it was after seven years the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.	I also saw a man who had been struck in the back by an arrow and the wound had closed over it; and when the space of seven years had elapsed the arrow came out at the root of the hip.	0.9121218
And I saw a woman who had been hit by an arrow in her abdomen, and the wound healed and the arrow remained, and nothing changed in her condition, nor did she feel any harm from it in any of her natural actions.	And I saw a woman who had been struck in the abdomen by an arrow and the wound healed with the arrow remaining in it, and her condition was unimpaired; she felt no harm from it and her natural functions were not harmed.	0.93073905
And I saw another man who had been hit by an arrow in his face, and the wound healed and he felt little pain from it.	And I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in the face, and it had healed over, and he did not feel much pain from it.	0.8805368
And many are like this.	And many such have I seen.	0.7752296
And I tell you how to remove some arrows so that you make that a measure and a guide to what I have not mentioned, because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description nor can a book encompass them, but rather the skillful craftsman measures by the little on the much and by what is present on what is absent, and he infers a new work and a new instrument when strange incidents descend from this craft.	Now I shall tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may take it as a guide and an analogy for others that I have not mentioned; since all parts and details of this art cannot be comprehended in any description, nor can any book include them. A skilful worker will form a judgement on much, from little; and on what is not present from what is before him; and he will think out a new method and a new instrument for an unaccustomed case when it occurs in the practice of this art.	0.8609511
So I say that arrows are removed from the organs in which they are stuck in two ways: either by pulling from the place from which it entered, or from the opposite direction.	So I would state that arrows come out from the parts of the body they have transfixed, in two ways: either by drawing out from the site of entry; or from the opposite side.	0.9066669
And those which come out from where they entered, either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, so it is pulled and removed. If it does not respond to coming out at the time it fell, then it is necessary for you to leave it for days until the flesh around it rots so that it is easy to pull and remove it.	An arrow that comes out by the track of its entry: the arrow may be visible, standing out from a fleshy part, in which case it may be extracted by pulling. If it does not respond to traction immediately it strikes, you must leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues have suppurated, when the pulling and extraction of it will be made easy.	0.7701105
Similarly, if it is stuck in a bone and does not respond to coming out, then also leave it for days and return to pulling and moving it every day, then it will come out.	Similarly if it has stuck fast in a bone and will not come out, leave this also for a few days, repeatedly pulling on it and shifting it day by day, and then it will come out.	0.8986622
If it does not respond to coming out after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill until you widen it for the arrow, then pull it and remove it.	But if it will not come out after some days, you will have to drill away the bone from all round with a fine drill so as to make room for the arrow; then draw on it and pull it out.	0.8087398
If the arrow which is stuck in the bone of the head has gone deep into one of the ventricles of the brain and some of those symptoms which I mentioned to you appear from the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until its matter clears up after days, for if the arrow has reached the peritoneum, then death will not delay it.	If the arrow is buried in some part of the body and is quite lost to sight, explore for it with a probe, and if you can feel it then draw it out with any suitable instrument.	0.49157435
As for if the arrow has hidden in a place in the body and is hidden from feeling, then examine it with a probe. If you feel it, then pull it with some instruments that are suitable for pulling it. If you cannot do it because of the narrowness of the wound and the distance of the arrow in the depth and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then make an incision on it until the wound widens and you are able to reach the arrow until you remove it.	But if you cannot get at it on account of the narrowness of the wound and the depth at which the arrow is, and there be no bone nor nerve nor blood-vessel, then cut round it until the wound be sufficiently wide to enable you to take hold of it and extract it.	0.6868117
If it has two barbs, grasp them, then free the flesh stuck in them from every side with every trick you can do that, and endeavor, if you cannot free the flesh, to break the barbs and twist them until you are free.	And if it have two barbs by which it is held, free them from the adherent flesh all round, in any way you can; or, if you cannot free the tissues, try skilfully to break off the two barbs and twist them about until the arrow comes free.	0.8473126
And when you try to remove the arrow in whatever place it may be, then use the twisting of your hand with the forceps to all sides until you free it, and be extremely gentle lest the arrow break and it be difficult for you to pull and remove it.	Whenever you try to extract an arrow from any part, employ a twisting motion of your hand with the forceps in all directions until you free it; and use the utmost gentleness not to break the arrow and thus make it hard to draw it out and remove it.	0.91356945
If you cannot do it at your time, then leave it for days until those fleshes around it rot, then return to it, for it will be easy then. If bleeding obstructs you, then use what we mentioned of treatment in its chapter.	If you are unable to get it out at once then leave it for some days until the tissues that surround it putrefy, then return to it, for then the extraction will be easy; and if haemorrhage interfere use the remedies prescribed in the chapter dealing with that.	0.893575
And guard yourself from cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use a trick in every way you can free the arrow, and let that be gently, slowly, and steadily as I described to you.	Exercise the utmost care not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve or tendon; and employ the greatest skill in freeing the arrow; it should be done gently and unhurriedly and with perseverance, as I have told you.	0.7931407
And it is necessary for you, when you pull the arrow, to put the patient in the shape he was in when the arrow struck, for that is more suitable. If you cannot do that, then use whatever shapes you can.	When extracting an arrow you should place the patient in the same position he was in when the arrow struck him, for that is more convenient; but if you cannot do this then let him be in whatever position is possible for you.	0.8192259
As for the arrow which comes out from the opposite direction, either something of it has protruded to the outside, or you find the end of the arrow by feeling from above the skin near and see it protruding, so make an incision on it, and let the incision be to the extent that the forceps can fit in it, then pull it, for it is easy to come out.	The arrow that is to be extracted from the opposite side either has some part protruding through or else the tip of the arrow gives rise to a palpable swelling just beneath the skin and you see it sticking out; then cut down upon it; the incision should be wide enough to admit the forceps. Then pull on it, for the extraction of it will be easy.	0.83129054
If it sticks in a bone, then twist your hand in a circle until the arrow affects the bone and widens for itself, then pull it. Otherwise, leave it for days, then return to it until it comes out.	If it is stuck in bone, twist it round with your hand until the arrow makes an impression in the bone and opens up a way for itself; then pull it. If it does not come out, let it alone for some days, and repeat until it does come out.	0.91415894
If the shaft of the arrow is in it, then push it with it. If the shaft has fallen and you want to use pushing, then insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the tail of the arrow, then push it with it.	If the arrow-shaft be in the wound, then thrust the arrow out with that. But if the shaft has fallen out, and you wish to employ thrusting, introduce down to it the hollow instrument whose cavity will enter upon the ferrule of the arrow, then push it forward with that.	0.88471925
If the arrow is hollow, then push it with an instrument that enters that cavity, for the arrow is easily removed by that.	If the arrow be hollow, thrust it forward with an instrument that will enter into the cavity, for the exit of the arrow will thereby be made easy.	0.8785964
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut away all the flesh that has become poisoned in it, if you can do that, then treat it with what is suitable for that.	If the arrow be poisoned you must, if you can, cut out in a circle all the flesh into which the poison has entered; then treat it with what is appropriate.	0.89912677
If the arrow is in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is close to what can be felt with the probe and you can make an incision on it, then make an incision and guard yourself from cutting a vein or nerve and remove it, then stitch the wound if it needs stitching, then treat it until it heals.	If the arrow that has struck be in the chest or abdomen or in the urinary bladder or in the flank and it be close enough for you to explore it with the probe and you can cut down upon it, then do so, but beware of cutting into a blood-vessel or nerve. Then remove the arrow. Afterwards suture the wound, if suture be necessary, and dress it until it heals.	0.9068432
The image of the forceps with which arrows are pulled:	Forceps for extracting arrows.	0.5014291
Its ends are like the beak of a bird, made as if it were a file; if it grips an arrow or something, it will not let it go.	The extremities resemble the bill of a bird and are engraved like a file so as not to lose grip when you close them upon an arrow or some other object.	0.7179934
And various types of it are made, large, small, and medium, all according to the size of the arrow, its smallness, the width of the wound, and its narrowness.	They are made in several kinds, large, small, or medium, all according to the bigness or smallness of the arrow and the breadth or narrowness of the wound.	0.83656144
This is solid at the end, like the probe, to facilitate its entry into the hollow arrow and pushing it.	The extremity is solid like a probe, to facilitate entry into, and pushing, the hollow arrow.	0.8501911
