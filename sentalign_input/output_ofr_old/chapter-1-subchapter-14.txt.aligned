When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient something to drink for three nights; afterward shave the head, and make a cautery in the middle with the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery called "clavilis" on the two eyebrows, a little below the hair; and be careful not to cut the artery.	When you have treated foetor by those methods given in its section and your treatment is unsuccessful, give the patient laxative draughts for three days; then shave his head; and burn with a median cauterization with the olivary cautery; then cauterize him twice above the eyebrows a little below the hair with a claviform cautery. Beware of cutting the artery. The figure of the claviform cautery.	0.7914747
