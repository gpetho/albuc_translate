Chapter Thirty-Six.
On Cauterizing Fistulas that Occur in the Anus and its Surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and procedure that we described in its place and is afraid of it, he may sometimes be healed by cauterization. So, if a fistula develops in someone, and pus and corrupt humors have been flowing from it for a long time, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then know the extent of its depth with the probe. Then heat the cautery that resembles the probe. Then insert it hot into the fistula itself, following the direction and depth of the fistula reached by the probe. Repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt tissues are burned, once, twice, or three times, as needed. 
And beware of burning a nerve if there is one there, or a large vein, or if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.
So be cautious about all these places. You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge that it is not deep. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area closes and the discharge stops and it remains so for a while, know that it has healed completely.
But if the discharge does not stop, know that it is deep, or that there is corrupt bone at its bottom, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
