Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I completed for you, oh sons, this book, which is the last of the science in medicine with its complement, and I reached the end of it, from its explanations and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation with the hand has been neglected in our region and in our time it has been entirely abandoned; until perhaps its science has perished and its track has been cut off; and there have not remained of it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered; and error and hesitation occurred to them, until its intentions were closed and its use was prolonged. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise concerning it, according to the method of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I should come with the forms of iron instruments of cauterization, and the rest of the instruments of the work; made from the addition of declarations and from the preparation of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason for which a good artisan of it with his hand is not found in our time, is: that the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen described, until he knows the instruments of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction, and separation, and has cognition of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their origin, and the pulsations of the veins, and the quiet ones, and the places of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that, Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about that in the introduction to this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy, does not understand, and already falls into error, by which men are harmed: just as I have seen many of them, who pretend to be knowledgeable about this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that the surgeon cut a stubborn tumor of the aposteme scrofula on the neck of a woman and cut some arteries on the neck so the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead at his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another surgeon who presumed to extract a stone from a man which had grown during his lifetime and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore cut to it, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	So the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I indeed had already been called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the weakness of the man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land because of medicine, and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him that he got a fracture in his leg near the heel, and the doctor hastened with his ignorance and pressed the fracture above the wound with poultices and tight bandages and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he treated him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he left him for some days and ordered him not to undo the bandage, and it remained so until his leg became an aposteme and his foot, and it led to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him, and I hastened to undo the bandage, and quietness followed, and he was relieved from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then the corruption ceased to spread through the limb until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous aposteme and it became an ulcer after some days, until the evil of it became great with its master.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What is, that when it is a pure cancer from melancholic humor, then it is not suitable to be pierced with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can tolerate it, so that the whole of it can be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, an operation to which health is associated, and an operation in which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already stirred up in every place of this book, where the operation comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	For it is necessary for you to beware of that and dismiss it, so that the foolish do not find a way to speak and to dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Receive therefore the measure with solicitude and protection, and your weak ones with facility and firmness, and use the better way leading by the grace of God to salvation and laudable succession: and dismiss terrible anxieties of difficult healing: and lift your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation enters into your faith and your commodity.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining to your glory, and elevated in this world, and afterwards to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in certain of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not call the bad sickness medicine, nor name it evil doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now however I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	The first chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of cauterization with fire and of cauterization with sharp medicine, the chapter, and ordered from head to feet, and forms of instruments, and iron tools of cauterization: and all that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	The second chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Of cutting and piercing, bloodletting and puncture, and of wounds: and the removal of arrows, and similar things to that: and the entire chapter, arranged in the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	The third chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Of restoration, and dislocation, and the cure of twisting, and similar things to that: the chapter, arranged from head to foot, and in the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Of cauterization, and the burning of ulcers: and with which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron, or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I mention the operation with it, it is necessary that I say the quality of its cauterizations, and of its ulcers: and in what complexion they are exhibited.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discourse on the quality of cauterization and ulcer, is a discourse subtle and profound, of science and of hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And many wise men have spoken on it, and have disagreed about it: and to me it is sufficient to take a little from their discourses, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that cauterization is suitable universally for every complexion, which is with matter, and without matter: excepting two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In the hot and dry complexions with matter they disagree.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some have said that cauterization is suitable for it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others have said the opposite of that, namely that cauterization is not suitable for the disease which is from heat and dryness: since the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable, that a hot and dry disease should be treated with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of that says: that what is done by cauterization is a remedy for every hot and dry ailment that occurs in the bodies of men, because when you examine the body of a man and its humidities in relation to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say through his speech: that the experiment has already revealed that to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	But truly it is not fitting that he come upon that, unless he who has already been tested and practiced in the chapter of cauterization's last exercise, and knows the diversity of the complexions of men, and the disposition of ailments within themselves, and their causes and accidents, and the space of time of them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the remaining complexions, however, there is not above use fear: and especially in cold and moist ailments.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have already agreed on these, and they do not disagree regarding treatment with cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, my sons, that the secret of curing by cauterization with fire and its goodness over cauterization with burning medicine is: because fire is simple, whose action does not penetrate except to the member which is cauterized, and it does not harm another member joined to it, except with little harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning medicine, however, penetrates to that which extends from the members, and perhaps it causes an ailment difficult to cure to occur in a member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, on account of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now indeed that has become known to us through experiment, on account of the length of service and study with art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I will excuse the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, I would not be allowed to reveal to you in this my book a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation on bodies through its expulsion, which expels diseases, demonstrated by philosophical speech, which will be sharpened in your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, my sons, that they themselves disagree about the time in which it is suitable to perform a cauterization, and they put forth a better time in spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that a cauterization is suitable at any time, because the harm that occurs on account of the time is outweighed by the benefit that is attracted with the cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cauterization is on account of pains from necessary pains, strong, urgent ones, which do not tolerate delay: because it is feared that a greater evil will occur from them, than the small harm that occurs on account of the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let it not fall into your minds, O my sons, that which they do not consider, except the common and foolish physicians, namely that those diseases which are healed by a cauterization, do not always relapse: and they propose that consequence, and the thing is not as they think: because a cauterization is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion, and evacuates the humidities which are the causes, why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, the cauterization surpasses medicine by the speed of its health, and the virtue of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible, that the disease may return at some hour of time according to the complexion of the infirm, and the location of its disease, and its virtue: and what is prepared in its body from an aggregation of superfluities in it: and what pervades into it in acquiring them from foods, and similar things from those causes, unless a disease is made, in which a cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle inflammation in a member causes little excess and moisture, such as a cauterization of the tooth, because of pain, and similar things to it, it is possible that the pain does not return to it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	And I speak to the common people again, that cauterization is the last of medicine, is a straightforward speech: not according to what they themselves intend in it: since they believe that there is no cure which is conferred with medicine, nor with anything else after the application of the cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The thing is contrary to that, and the intention, that cauterization is the last of medicine, is not, except that when we administer modes of cure in some disease, and those medicines do not confer: then we administer at the end of the thing a cauterization, and it confers: then it falls, that cauterization is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say that except because of the equality of gold, and the subtlety of its substance: and they said that it does not produce pus in the place of the cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But it is not absolutely true: since I have already proven that and found that it does not do that in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with gold is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you make cauterization fire from gold, it is not declared to you, when it is ignited according to the quantity that you use, because of the redness of gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add ignition on top of it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Wherefore the craftsman falls from that in work: and because of that cauterization with iron is done by us more quickly and nearer to the rightness of operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have already arranged this chapter on cauterization, following the chapters, and I have arranged them from head to feet, so that they provide to the inquirer what he wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the method of cauterizing the head in the crown-shaped incision.
Caput II.	Head II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is useful for dominating humidity and chill on the brain: which two are causes of swelling, and an abundance of flowing humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and an abundance of sleep, and pain in the teeth, and pain in the throat: and universally all sickness that occurs from chill, such as palsy, and swelling, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar to those sicknesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you should first prepare the weak person: so that they are evacuated in the beginning with a cleansing medicine for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the weak person demands, and their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then order them to shave their head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have them sit between your hands in a square shape, so that they now place their hands on their chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then put the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that place with an incision.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then prepare the olive cautery for ignition, whose shape is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then put it on the marked place with an incision, lowering it, as your hand is tightened little by little, and you rotate it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that it has already taken from the bone a quantity of head alkali, or a quantity of zeherb, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, then move your hand with the iron itself or with something else by means of it, if it becomes cold: until the bones which I mentioned to you are visible.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cotton in it, and put it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put on it cotton soaked in butter, and leave it on the place, until the eschar is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment tetrapharmacon, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Now they have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus, therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and that the cautery should be applied until something adheres to the thickness of the bone.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape after that which has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to penetrate with the cautery to the extreme, until it impresses on the bone an impression of a mold, so that the bone falls, which is made like the form of a crate: or the instrument that women put on by means of the alphabet infusion: and they extract, what they breathe out from this place vapors of the head, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it, until it becomes consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, however, these two types of cautery do not seem suitable except in certain men according to the path of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it alone is better for me with its own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity: as we have been shown in the other members: and especially when the head is weak and feeble by nature: and a certain type of cautery is more salutary and better for me, and I approve it: therefore operate with it for health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the method of cauterizing the head for pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When there is a chronic pain in the whole head: and it is prolonged to the weak, and it is treated with henna, and quinine, and head purges, and oils, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things help it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the weak person is of strong natural creation, and it is not weak, and it has found intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery under that a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it itself over every horn of its head with a cautery, so that the skin is not pierced, and a quantity is discovered from the bone, which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with one cautery on the back of its head, in the place which is called "uas": and it is a place where the ventose is put: and raise your target in this, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak person finds it due to that vehement pain, and different from the pain of the other cauterizations of the whole head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say that this Cautery in its own place: and it is necessary that it be a cautery, with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its back is more subtly cauterized than the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cauterizing for half-headaches, both with medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When there is pain and swelling in one part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is treated with medicines that cleanse the head, and the rest of the treatment is administered, which I mentioned in the divisions of illnesses, and none of that helps: then cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cauterization with sharp burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cauterization with acute burning medicine is such that you take one tooth of a badger, and scrape it, and cut off its extremities on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain at the time with a broad lancet, until a place is made under the skin, in which the dens is captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Insert it then under the skin, until it is hidden: then bind over it with a poultice of decent constriction, and leave it for fifteen hours; then undo it, and extract the badger, and leave the wound two days, or three: afterwards put on it a plaster submerged in butter, until the place makes pus: then cure it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to make it with certain burning medicines, which I wrote in the twelfth treatise, on medicines for burning.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But cauterization of it with iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire cauterization, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a Clavulus: because the form of its head is like the form of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in the middle of it is a certain small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put it on the place, and hold your hand: and you withdraw the iron little by little with speed: and let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, as its middle.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that the artery which is beneath is not burned, and there occurs a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the plaster in salt water, and put it on the place, and leave it for three days: then put a plaster with butter: afterwards cure it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this half of the skull with the edge of a second cauterizing knife.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting the arterial vein in this half of the skull, not being old is a particular property.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in the old half skull.
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat the half skull, with what we said in the preceding treatment, and what we said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is not effective: and you see from the disease that what we said about the first cauterization with medicine or with fire is not sufficient for it, then you must use a sharp cauterizing iron, until it becomes white after you make a sign above the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or something like that: and put your hand in its place, and press it until you cut the artery, and penetrate to the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	Truly it is necessary for you to beware of the continuity of the jawbone, which moves during mastication, lest the side or nerve that moves it be scorched, whence spasms occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this is above caution and warning about the flow of arterial blood which has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in cutting it off there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what he does, and is neither careful nor experienced: and he gives up the operation at the start.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the treatment of the flow of blood that occurs from an artery, according to its own method, and in the proper place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	What if you see from the disease that this cauterization is not sufficient for it, and you see the weak body tolerating a cauterization on the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cauterization that we spoke of in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cauterizing iron having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing for ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter Six.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold and is treated with solutiuis and the rest of the treatment that we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then cauterization by fire: and it is that which is called a punctum, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then prick it with that after its ignition all around the entire ear, as it revolves: or around both, if pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And extend yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear for a little while, after you have marked the place with ink: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten punctures on all the ear, or about that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cauterizing for twisting.
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Twisting that is treated with cauterization is not except for the types which occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And it lacks cauterization of the type that occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of twisting with hiers and purging of the head and gargling and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the weak place with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little below its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And put your cauterization on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of the cauterization is that you should cauterize it with a cauterity on the direct extremity of the upper ear under the horn of the head a little, and another in the temple: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And put your hand with the cautery until the quantity of the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the Cautery, and it is a type from a knife, whose shape has been described above: nevertheless it is not thinner than that little, as you see: and it is necessary that the knife be a little above superfluous grossness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with what has gone before until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in old Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When the Apoplexy becomes old and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication is not effective, and the weak person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cauterization on the back of the head, according to what has gone before: and the method of the cauterization should be according to what has gone before.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	And he is also cauterized with a Cautery on the bone of the stomach: and it is even more extreme.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the entire head of the weak person, and put on his back of the head a plaster made from mustard as described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it to him several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This indeed is the method of Cautery: and do that according to the same order which I mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which extend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and put between each cauterization the thickness of a finger.

Then shave the head of the weak person: afterwards cauterize it with a cauterization in the middle of the head, and with a cauterization above each horn of the head, and with a cauterization above its back, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you immerse in the disease of softening of the body more than those, and he is weak for bearing it, and the disease is strong: then cauterize it with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, and lastly with a cauterization, until much of its skin is burned, and lift your hand.

It is necessary therefore that you cleanse his brain first with caution, and with the rest of the treatment which we have spoken of in the division: when he is greatly weak, or is bearing the reception of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If however he is a boy, who does not bear medicines, then let him be given a gargle and purging mastics which cleanse the brain, for many days before with improvement of foods.

Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it on the two temples with two cauteries, if there is a simultaneous flow of water in both eyes: or on one side, if there is a flow of water in one eye: and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in width across the temples: and cauterize to stop the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	What if you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them, and caution against the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and frequent: and they are above the veins and arteries which are on the manifest outer head, it is verified that this is from cold and phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I narrated in the descent of water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every side and they will stretch out from both temples and let the length of each cautery be according to the lengths of the eyebrow and do not extend your hand with the cautery except according to the quantity that the third eyelid is burned.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when inverted eyelashes prick the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery in this is according to two methods: either a cautery with fire or a cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cautery with fire, instruct the weak one beforehand so that he let his eyelashes drop if he is one of those who clean them until they are prolonged and equal.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If they sting him near his eyes: then constrict his eyes with a cloth, so that they do not move, until they heal.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore the wounds heal and become equal, then put the head of the sick person in your lap: afterwards apply a mark above the eyelid of his eyes with a caustic, a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put a cloth soaked in egg white on the eye, or a dressing of psyllium over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply cautery with fire, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure that you marked little by little on many places, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, entirely appearing properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contract, and the hairs rise up at the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Raise your hand therefore then: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then put on it a cloth with butter, until the scar is eradicated.

And if you want, submerge a thread, or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth: and put over it a heated iron, until the fire penetrates to the deep concavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But the cauterization of it with fire is, that you heat a bronze or iron tube.

Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then cauterize with fire, whose shape will come: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand, until the cauterization cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be relieved, either on that same day, or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary in the application of that cauterization, that it fill the weak bone with good pus, and that it hold it for one hour; then it expels it.

Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When there occurs an exit wound, and you want to know if that apostema is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, a weak pain and heaviness without sharpness invade: and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with pain there is vehement sharpness: and you see already that it has wearied its physicians with treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary therefore that the weak man breathes upon his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then figure the place of the apostema with a searing heat: then ignite a cautery which is similar to a hot branding iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one cautery, until the entire skin is burned, and it penetrates to the siphac, until all the pus comes out: then treat it with the treatment of exit wounds, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary that this species of cautery be used, except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands these diseases run with experimentation many times: then indeed he dares to undertake an operation of this kind.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But to leave it, with me it is better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said, a cautery with the roots of aristolochia for a cold Pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you take from the roots of the dry long aristolochia, one root which is longer and found on it, and is as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in oil: and ignite it in the fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery at the place which is between the junction of the jaw and the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping downwards towards the part that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also at the place which is between the fifth and sixth ribs sloping downwards towards the back a little: and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries on the back: one at the place which is between the two shoulder blades: and two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, unless it be on the manifest skin with a foul smell.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And certain ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron similar to a probe: and they ignite it, and insert it inside between the ribs, until it reaches with it to the apostema itself, and the pus comes out: as we have said concerning the apostema of the pleura.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the method of cauterizing the Spleen Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the disease of the spleen, with that which we have said concerning the cure in the division of diseases, and your treatment is not effective, then a cautery on it is according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of these one is, that you make three or four cauteries along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the pleura, whose figure has preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between the cautery a quantity of the thickness of a finger, or a little more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of the cautery be that which we have described for the cautery of the liver equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient lean weakly on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: as we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder, to hold two rods of a fiery cautery, and to raise the skin which is along the spleen, where the weak left elbow penetrates: and let your elevation be such that you raise the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two ignited rods well in, until you penetrate the skin with them from the other side: then extract the cautery: thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three rods.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care that the cautery, after you apply it, discharges pus for many days: for it is more conducive to healing than all the other things which have preceded in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the method of cauterizing in Dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall into a case of dropsy, except for a proper ascites.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a case of dropsy with the methods of cure which we have described in the division, and the cure is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery on the stomach, and another cautery on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two cauteries on the back between the spine, and one along the breast, and another along the stomach: and let the quantity of the depth of the cautery be near to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then diminish the open cauterization so that it emits pus over a long period.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And the weak should not be evacuated from the cure after the cauterization with what is necessary so that two intentions are added to it, and the healing will hasten with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be a clamp, according to the form that preceded it: and that with which the back is cauterized, an olive, according to the form that preceded it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they have apostemed in a hydropic and are filled with citrine water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocturnal, which is between the ear and the ring finger: and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the citrine water will flow out, and let the cautery be according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the extremity of the knife's edge: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee and another lower than that, around the middle of the leg: and on the entire thigh make two cauteries: and diminish the open cautery without cure for a long time: so that some water flows out from it: then cure it with the remaining things that we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterizing for the relief of the belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a solution of the belly from cold and humidities, until it debilitates the retaining and digestive virtues, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with modes of cure, and not healed: and you see the weak one tolerating the cautery of abundant virtue, then cauterize it with a great cautery on its stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle clamp cautery: and a great cautery above the alcatin above the hump, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive humidity and the weak patient tolerating it, then cauterize it with a cauterizer over the chest, and cauterize everything with it: and perhaps you will add two small cauterizations over the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is indeed a advancing treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from gross humors, cold, or corrupt humidities, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauterizations above the lower vertebra of the back under the alumidei for a short time in a triangular fashion, and cauterize under the navel almost two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face breaking out in a rash, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cauterizer, according to what has preceded: and cauterize over his liver, and another over his spleen, with a cauterizer of the spine: and apply the open cauterization for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing the warts after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you remove a wart, then apply a cauterizer that resembles a radish.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited thing into the removed wart: and with your hand, until the cauterizer penetrates to the opening of the vein, from which blood runs: do it once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many warts, then cauterize each one with a cauterizer according to what we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with that which is beneficial to them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cauterization on the shoulder, it is more so in the joint.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Of the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the weak one does not undergo the cutting and operation that we described in its own place, and is deterred by it, perhaps he will be healed with a cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula occurs to someone, and it becomes chronic, pus runs out of it, and corrupted moistures.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is fitting therefore that which ought to be done, that you should examine it with a subtle probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the quantity of its depth with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply a cautery iron, which is similar to a probe.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the ignited instrument itself into the fistula and the quantity in which the nail entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery over it, until all those corrupted bodies are burnt, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the quantity of your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And beware of the burning of the nerve, if it is there, or of the great vein: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do that, unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think, that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the place becomes closed, and matter is cut off from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then know that it is already healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if matter is not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is a corrupted opening, or something like that: the reminder of which will come in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When there is pain in the kidneys from cold or from gross flatulence and it becomes weaker because of that, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the almethen over the kidneys themselves, to cauterize each kidney with a cauterizing iron, whose description has preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we will cauterize it a second time on that same almethen.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Three linear scars will appear.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, the last ones will be more in the flank.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When there is weakness in the bladder and softening from cold and humidity, until it does not retain weak urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the pubic area over the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic area begin, and cauterize with one cauterizing iron on the right side of the pubic area, and another on the left side: and let the length of that cauterization be according to the quantity of a knot of the thumb: and cauterize it with a lower back cauterizing iron, or two cauterizing irons, if you judge it necessary: and let it be according to what has preceded, the cauterizing iron of the clavicle.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When there is cold and humidity in the uterus, and it is prevented from conception because of that, and its menses are corrupted, and the provocation of them is delayed, and pain happens to it at the time of their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cauterizing irons around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and cauterize over the lower abdomen with a back cauterizing iron, or two cauterizing irons: and let the cauterizing iron be of the clavicle.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing an ankle in a state of dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous humidities are poured out to the ankle's box, and they become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other when they are compared together: and the place of dislocation is found vacant in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	It is necessary therefore that you cauterize the weak place above the ankle's box with a similar circular cautery: after which you mark with a branding iron around the circumference of the box, as it turns out: and so that the box itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be one whose shape was described previously in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	Which if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-tree cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterizing for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the box of the ankle, and the causes of it are cold and humidities: and the weak place is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not work, and it becomes worse: then it is necessary that you release the weak place from gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautery in it is according to two methods: either a cautery with adhering medicines, or a cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cautery with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is, that you cauterize above the ankle's box with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make for them a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between all cautery be of the quantity of the thickness of the finger, and let the cautery be of olive.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle on top of the head of the same ankle.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	There are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you apply the cautery with a circle, whose shape has preceded in the dislocation of the ankle, to one: so that the circle contains the whole ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of the cautery for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the ankle itself, and does not extend to the hip and the leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends to the hip and the leg, then apply the cautery with two cauteries above the hip, above the place to which that weakness points, in which is the pain, and apply your cautery above the haunch four fingers towards the wooded area for a short time: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	Which if the weakness indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes of the foot, then apply the cautery there where it points with a cautery of one point, or three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if it points to the pain being under the knee turned to the leg, then apply the cautery there with one knife-shaped cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in every cautery of yours, that you do not apply the cautery to this, so that you burn a nerve, or a large artery, and draw through it above the weakness a bad nocument, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have already seen one and another, of those who applied the cautery above the haunch, and finished in the cautery, and the leg became inflamed, until a tumor followed to the foot, and it was entirely perforated, and the entire foot was corrupted: then there occurred a loosening of the belly, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	What if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men have said regarding cauterization of the ankle, whose cauterization this is the method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar iron instrument, the diameter of which is half a palm, and let it be at its orifice according to the thickness of a date stone, or a little less, and inside that instrument let there be a third instrument.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between all the instruments be the size of a thumb joint, and let the instruments be open on two sides, and let their height be like a knot, or two knots, and make for them a handle from iron decently fitted to the instruments.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be ignited in the fire until it becomes red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed on a weak ankle, having reclined on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Cauterize it therefore with three round cauterizations in one spot.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply a plaster with butter, and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, we have made little use of this type of cauterization, on account of the terror of its appearance, and because we find few who dare to try it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is one of the good cauterizations for him who suffers it and finds its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	A cauterization with adhering medicines is to make two instruments having a perforated armlet, into which descends a rod of the door of bronze or iron, the length of a wall, and for their height there are two knots, or nearly so.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space that is between both be the size of a finger's thickness, and let it be open below and above, and let what they contain be joined to each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then remove it and place it on a plaster bandage, the weak lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand strongly on the plaster bandage.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles from warm water, which has been heated with fire for a short time, and hold it for an hour's quantity of time: and let the weak endure its biting and burning, for he finds the biting as fire, until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the entire bandage with sweet water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put on it butter, until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will be cured from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last in the treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	What if the pain extends to the hip or the leg: make for it a plaster that contains water, according to what you did on the bandage equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take of alkaline substance and unslaked lime each one part: grind both, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which is perforated with one small hole, according to the quantity that the radius may enter: and put under the bottom of the pot another pot vitreous: and throw over the alkaline substance and lime sweet water, which submerges both by the finger: after which you compress it with your hand with good compression: and leave the pot until sharp water descends to the lower part of the vitreous pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect that water entirely, and throw it over another lime: and filter, until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	It itself will then be of strong sharpness indeed, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of the remaining members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Since it performs the operation of its own fire.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And there are medicines with which they cauterize the anch, and also such as tessie, and honey of the anacard, and lime with soap, so that both may be mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen told of a certain man from the ancients, whose cure was for the pain of the ankle and the vein of the thigh, and he declared its effectiveness to be very great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not need another cure, and that he was healed by one remedy, until he related that he perhaps entered a bath and came out of it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, that it be taken from the green vitriol, and if the green is not found, let the dry, fresh one be taken, and let it be ground much with some fat, and let it be put on the ankle, where there is pain, or the leg, or in the hip, and let it be tied, and let it be left for the quantity of three hours, or as long as he feels the weakness of the heat of the application.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then let him enter into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes very sweaty, let him enter into the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary to use any cauterization with these medicines, unless after the purging of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides said that the dung of capers, when with it the vein of the thigh is cauterized, brings to it relief, and makes a cauterization in this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let wool be ground, and let it be soaked with old oil, and let it be put on the deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry dung of a goat and set it on fire, until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then put it on a cloth and let it be, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not stop doing that until the sensation on the middle and up to the ankle is penetrated and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called the cauterization of the cow.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Of the cauterization of pain in the back.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back for many reasons, or from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and damp material: and cauterization is not applied, except in this single case, which occurs from the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after evacuation of the weak with fetid pills and similar things, so that they make on the back, where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the affected part, then mark with a cautery in each line five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the weak, by virtue of which: and let the cauterization be made with cauterized points.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizations, with the middle clavicular cautery, according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Of the method of cauterizing in cases of gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This sickness often happens to small infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of this disease in children is: that there occurs a tightening on it with shortness of breath at elevation and movement: and you find in the last vertebrae of the back and its knots, which already begins to protrude over the remaining vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When I raise that and make a use for it, then I cauterize it with a cauterizer that is a circle according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cauterization take hold equally over every part of the vertebrae: and if you cauterize around the vertebrae with a pointed cauterizer two or three lines: and let the points be close to one another.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you administer a cauterization on a hump that forms in a spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing for gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are from cold humidities that flow to any members of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is by custom of physicians to name that specifically Gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore gout caused by cold is treated with methods of cure and the pains are not removed, then a cauterization removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you cauterize after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauterizers: and let the cauterization be with an oily one.
Cuius haec est forma.	Its form is like this.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you indicate that there are points on the surface of the foot, then make them with a pointed cauterizer.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	Which if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints and it often happens, then cauterize it above every knee with three or four cauterizers on every side, with this same cauterizer of the ankle.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however many are needed for you with this cauterizer, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cauterizer, but rather let it be to the thickness of the skin as much.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however pains ascend to the knees and the back: then administer what we have said from cauterization in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	What if pains are in the hands only, then puncture at the circuit of the elbow joints, as two lines turn.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however there remains from pains in the fingers, then puncture them, above every joint a puncture, and above the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the weak from a good regime, from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regime is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God by this cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of rupture.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and intestine descends, or a cyst to the testicle, and it is beginning nearby: then it is necessary to prescribe to the weak that they abstain from food on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that feces may descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and prescribe to him, that he hold his breath, until it comes out, or the cyst appears, or intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cauterizing iron under the rupture on the bone of the hip, with a mark whose extremities are similar to the middle of a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then ignite the cauterizing iron, which has this form, until it becomes white, and throws out sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or cyst to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the servant put his hand on the place, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the thighs of the weak, and placed under it a pillow, and one servant over the thighs of him, and another over his chest who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then apply the cautery on the same sign, your hand with the cautery standing upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you bring it to the mouth, or turn it with it twice, if you have not brought it to the mouth at first.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the intestine's exit at the time of your cauterization, lest you burn it, and an issue comes through that above the weak or mortified place, or great malignity.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not bring the cautery to the mouth, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is fitting that the cautery for infants be subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with the remaining ointments, until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the weak one lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is fitting that you put a nourishment for it for the length of time of its cure, which will soothe its stomach: so that the intestine does not come out through the wound and vomiting.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him hold it for forty more days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should be kept from labor, and from the filling of food and drink, and vehement voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regime, thus will he be healed with a complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the cure of hernias with an incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When however hernias occur in the remaining abdomen, and are beginning, and it is seen that they do not increase, then cauterize the hernia with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let what is applied be about one third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat it with what we have said: and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some of the first have said: that a hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with a cautery, and a line is placed which runs along the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line to the lower one.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And put your hand in the middle with the cautery on the hip.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the method of cauterizing for pains caused by a fall or a blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain members from a fall or a blow, and the pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is of no benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery of each member be a second cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat it over the same cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For it is a habit of these pains that they are transferred from one member to the one that is nearest to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Wherefore it is necessary to follow them with a cautery until the weak part is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of cauterizing for leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Lepers are sometimes helped by a very strong cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: when therefore you want to cauterize it, consider it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it does not decrease, nor stop: and there is a weak spot that corruption has comprehended over its whole complexion: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one on the middle of the head at the knot, and a second below that towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally touch your hand briefly with the cautery, until it impresses a small mark on the mouth, and the cortices will dislocate from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors is eased from it, and cauterize with the cautery also above the same spleen, according to what has proceeded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the weak part, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries, which we mentioned in the beginning, and cauterize above the extremity of the nose, and with two cauteries above the two jaws, and with two cauteries above the vertebrae of the neck, and six above the vertebrae of the back, and one large one above the region of the tail near the end of the spine and one above it, in the same flank: and two above the elbows: namely one above each elbow, and two above the knees: one above each knee, and two above the shoulders, and two above the elbows, and two above the tenderness of his chest: and cauterize it above every joint, of the joints of his fingers and toes: and cauterize above every heel of his feet, and the soles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are above the heel, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes cauterization is performed with a cautery on the bone of the chest, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cautery, the greater is the benefit, and the more it helps.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the weak person does not find pain in the cautery, as the healthy ones do: because his body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of a size and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to what has preceded from the species of iron instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat with a cauterization made from powder of the herb with honey, and continue the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the method of cauterizing for a stupor.
Caput L.	Head of the sick person
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any member is numb, and it is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and it is not healed, then cauterize the numb member with cauterizations, according to what its size deserves or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cauterization penetrate briefly into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when the cauterization is applied for a numbness that occurs to the hand and foot, at the joints of the back near where the nerves exit, which move that member: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	Indeed, let no one presume to do this except one who is wise in the anatomy of the members and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterizing for Baras.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When the Baras becomes chronic and nothing from the ingenuity of medicine is effective for it: then cauterize over it with a deep cauterization briefly, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with powder of the herb and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and blood of a pigeon, and blood of a hyrundine: let each be one part: mix all these things, and apply them to a cloth, and adhere to the place, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterizing for a Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the Cancer is beginning and you want to restrain it: then cauterize it with a circular cauterization around its circumference, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men have said that a cauterization should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	It does not seem to me: because I fear that it will become an ulcer, and I have already seen that happen many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of boils.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has a boil and it is delayed in maturing, either because of the excess matter that makes it, or because of the weakness of the patient, when he is decrepit and has little blood, or because of the time and the need to hasten the maturation of the boil, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, making many punctures.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten the maturation by itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you want to make a perforation of it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, whose shape is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the boil, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be made from that which follows, being weak, so that the flow of pus may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterizing for a corroding sore.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corroding sore is nothing but a corruption that moves in a member and corrodes it: just as fire devours dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If you see a corroding sore in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then prepare many cauteries, small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the corroding sore is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it on every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and none of it remains in any way.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then touch the same for three days, and apply over the cauterized place burnt sulfur with oil, until all eschars are eradicated, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then heal it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days sound flesh is born without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery over that which remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corroding is treated whenever with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It itself rises in place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	But indeed the cautery with fire is of quicker relief: and I have already spoken of its cauterization with sharp medicine in division: therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing in hammer-like tumors and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	It often happens that this sickness occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a coarse, foul thing which harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed the cautery for them is in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	But as for the one with fire, it is like a hollow cautery of a falcon's feather, which is made from iron, according to the quantity that the hammer contains on all sides: and let its edges be subtle.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then apply it ignited upon the hammer-like tumor.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn the hand with the cautery around the hammer-like tumor, until the cautery penetrates to the depth of the tumor: and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster it with crushed forest herbs, ground with salt: and leave the plaster on it during the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with a generating ointment of flesh until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	What if they are not turned and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer to them cauterization with hot water: and it is, that you take a small tube made of bronze, or iron, or from a feather of a vulture: and put it on the nail, or the ulcer.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw into the tube a small quantity of hot water: hold your hand, and you turn it with compression of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the tube is impressed on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the weak one wait for an hour on the biting of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release it, for the nail is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with them one after another, until you come to all of them that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they have been eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cauterizing for Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone that he has a Tremor from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or another: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauterizations, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and between all the vertebrae a cauterization, and on his chest a cauterization, and on his stomach a cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For the Tremor is stilled with an oily cauterization, and health hastens to cold feverish illness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing for Albaithar ( possibly a misspelling or variation of "Alb
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When foul Albathar sores are expelled from the body, that is, pustules, which are made from corrupted gross matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is necessary therefore in the beginning when they appear, that the pustules on the entire head should be cauterized with a subtle cauterization of myrtle wood, whose extremities have been kindled with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cauterizer.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with an adamant, at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method: and it does not increase: and the superfluity is disrupted making them, and they are healed from it.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	Truly however it is necessary that it be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut at the site of a wound, which occurs externally, or at the site of an incision of a postule, or cauterization of a limb, and similar things to these: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When therefore it happens to anyone, then apply your hand quickly to the orifice of the artery, and put your index finger on top of it: and press it strongly, until the blood is blocked under your finger, and does not come out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put into the fire small olive cauterizers, and a large number of them: and blow on them until they are ignited strongly.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, small or large, according to the wound and the place in which the artery is disrupted, and put the cauterizer on the vein itself, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cauterizer until the blood is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If the blood is expelled when you lift your finger from the orifice of the artery, and you extinguish the cauterizer, then quickly take another cauterizer from the ones that have been prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	You should not stop doing that with one thing after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you confuse the nerve that is there, and the injury affects the weak place.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or let it be bound with a strong thread of ligation.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or let medicines of the proper kind be placed on it, which are to cut off blood, and let it be bound with a dressing of suitable constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	He who administers the cutting off of it with a ligature, and binding with a cloth, or application of burning things, and similar, does not penetrate to it at all, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to anyone, and there is not a doctor present to him, nor medicine: then let him begin with the placement of the index finger on the opening of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and constriction of it strongly, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And let the finger not be removed from upon it, with water very cold and violently cold, until the blood congeals, and coagulates, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile let him consider what it needs from a cautery or from medicine.

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Of the Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have discussed in the first chapter, every kind of illness for which it is suitable to use a cauterizing fire and burning medicine, and its occasions, and its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauterizations.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed chapters from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter by the same method: that the seeker may seek what is sought regarding it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, O sons, what in this chapter is an addition to what is in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this, it is necessary that there be a more vehement caution, since in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision over an apostema, or opening of an exit, or cure of an ulcer, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which are associated trembling, and fear, and death often occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest it fall upon you that in which there is hesitation, for sometimes men of a certain type fall into your hands in this art with types of weaknesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there is one who becomes angry with his own illness, and death is light to him: on account of the vehemence of what he finds from his weakness and the length of his suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And the illness is from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And there is one who gives his trust to you, and commits himself to you, hoping for health, and his illness is perilous.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not necessary that you consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vehement than your greed and your rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not assume anything about it, unless after certain knowledge, which proves to you that which leads to successful treatment.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And may you be skilled in the cure of all your patients, in prognosis and indication of that to which health is most conveniently suited.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in it is your aid for acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with His intellect, and may He not withhold from you guidance and inspiration: for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cauterization, from the neck to the feet: so that may be alleviated for you what you wish from it, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the cure of water that collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter One.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this weakness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife pulls the head of the child with force.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And it also happens sometimes for a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have indeed not seen this sickness in others except in children: and for every one of them whom I saw, death was imminent: therefore it seemed to me that it was advisable to omit the operation in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have indeed seen one of them, a child, whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit up by himself, because of the size of his head: and the wetness increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this wetness indeed either collects between the skin and the bone: or collects under the bone above the brain.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on it, if the wetness is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make a single incision in the middle of the head in width: and let the length of the incision be about two knots, until the wetness flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the humidity is greatly increased, and the aposteme is larger, then put two fissures, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the humidity is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the skull open on every side: and water is pressed out when you press it with your hand to the interior, and it is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you find in the middle of the skull three fissures, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract the whole humidity.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the fissures with bandages and poultices.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then anoint it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then undo the bandage, and cure the wound with dressings and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not cease to bind the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak person with every dry food of little humidity, until the member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is that you consider where appears the greatness of the aposteme, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or on one side, or to the right, or to the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Go up therefore with the incision where it appears to you that the aposteme and the collection of water is: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you cut the artery, and there occurs a flow of blood, and the weak person dies from that flow with an abundance of humidity.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter Two.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When there occurs to someone a catarrh to the eyes, or to the breast, and it aggravates that, and the cure of medicines does not help: then the greatest cure is in that, the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when one makes an incision on them, that the weak head is shaved.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the weak one constrict his neck, with any cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are the places which are behind the ears and depressed: and rarely is it hidden, except in certain men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a branding iron above both: and make an incision on both sides with a sharp spatula, the incision extending to the mouth: and let it be as wide as the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if necessary, insert the spatula under the artery, and make an incision upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about two fingers joined.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps to the interior with a frequent jump.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the quantity of a space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a branding iron, and extend to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what is necessary to emit from the blood, is six ounces and perhaps you emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All that according to the quantity which appears to you from the virtue of the weak one and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the ulcer.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains at the mouth of the abscess, then cut it, so that a warm aposteme does not occur: then constrict the ulcer with ligatures from a linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Of the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old headache occurs to a man, or sharp catarrh due to acrimonious humidities and heat in the temporal arteries, or old abscesses, and ulcers, and similar things: and it is treated with modes of curative medicine, and it does not help: then we are experienced in these ailments in the extraction of the arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we will narrate.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them, is that the weak [patient] should shave the hairs which are on the temples, and direct [the instrument] to the apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It itself shows to you from its own pulse, and is rarely hidden except in few men, or due to cold withering.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	What if it is hidden from you, then the weak [person] should bind his head with any bandage of his: then rub the place with a coarse cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or fumigate the place with hot water, until it appears to you with a clear appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I formed a little before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scratch the skin with it with ease, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw into it a hook, and pull it upwards, until you pull it out of the skin, and make it protrude from the tunics which are under it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is slender, then entwine it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a part according to the quantity by which the extremities of it lengthen and contract, and not cause a flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend inwardly.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then let out from the blood a sixth of an ounce, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	What if the artery is large then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a double thread of silk or of a string from a bow, so that putrefaction does not reach it before consolidation of the wound and there occurs a flow of blood.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut the surplus which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you do, cauterize it with a cauterizing iron up to the mouth, with a knife-shaped cauterizer, until its ends are cut and it stands in the place of the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless he who has it is weak with fever, or is of a hot temperament.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cauterizer is one of those things which help to end moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old cotton, and that powders well made be put on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the dressing, let it be treated with dry medicines which make flesh grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if meanwhile while you are operating there occurs a flow of blood from the artery, then hasten to cut it with a cauterizer, or so that you fill the place with cotton, and constrict your hand until the bleeding is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	What if none of those things are present to you, then put your finger over the place, until the blood coagulates.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And moisten the place with water of vehement cold, until the acute pain is stilled, and constricted according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And of that which is lighter and easier for the extraction of the artery, it is to cauterize the vein with this cauterizer having two knives, and let the sharpness be similar to a double-edged knife.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	The needle threads are of much smaller thickness than two hairs.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp, like two hairs, they will penetrate on both sides and not enter the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When therefore there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: therefore this work is better than any work, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space that is between two hairs be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with caustic, and apply both ignited cauteries strongly, until they reach the mouth, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between the extremities may be prolonged.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not consolidate with this cautery deeply.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of the courses of tears with frequent cauterization from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are frequent tears and their course is from the veins which are on the outer surface of the skull above the head, and no cure is effective for them with medicines, and you see the face of the infirm already red, and he feels a walking in his forehead like the walking of ants: and his eyes are weak, humid, so that already the hairs of them are corroded by corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of tears: then the ancients required for their cure this operation, and they named it cure with Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is that you should instruct the infirm to shave the hairs which are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equally spaced incisions in the forehead according to its length: and let the length of the incision be about two fingers, and one incision be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the eyebrows, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are in both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all incisions be the quantity of three joined fingers: and have a piece of prepared sponge, or many dried cloths, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a spatula of two acute extremities, whose following shape is a form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is on the temporal side, up to the second incision: and excavate with it the whole skin, which is between the two incisions, with the sifac, which is above the mouth.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp cultellus, blunt on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And put its sharp side towards the flesh joined with the skin, and its blunt side towards the mouth: and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a quantity of blood has flowed out equally, press out the places from the clots of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put in all the fissure a dressing from old cloth, and put over them small pieces soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot aposteme does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligature, and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment of royal unguent, and other things which are used to treat wounds: until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Of the treatment of sharp and flowing discharges from the eyes due to internal conditions of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When sharp, acid, and frequent discharges occur to someone, and you see his eyes weakened, pale, and their appearance already debilitated: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and in the depths of the head there is a sharp, laeding pain, and consequent sneezing: then consider among these accidents, that those matters and discharges do not come, unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And better treatment in them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you order the weak to scratch their own forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut in it one fissure in the middle of the forehead, or another a little through its width, and start with the fissure from the left temple to the right temple: and let the cutting be up to the bone: and stretch out your hand from the muscles of the temples, which move during mastication: until when the bone is laid bare: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a cloth of old cloth, or with a linen thread.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind above with pads: and soak the pads with wine and oil, so that hot aposteme does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it, and you see that the hot aposteme has already begun to diminish: then it is necessary that you rub the bone, until flesh begins to be born in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a regimen of excitation that makes flesh be born: as if you take two parts from wheat flour, and four parts from colophony: and prepare from them an plaster, and administer to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Of the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the Ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or similar to stone, such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans: or it is a fluxing thing, such as water and vinegar, and their similars: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or a kind of stone from those which do not adhere, nor grow in the ear, expose the Ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then distill into the Ear something from violet oil, or sesame.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make him sneeze with condisi, and stop up his nostrils at the approach of sneezing, after you put in the opening of the ear pieces of cloth, or wool, and stretch the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For many times it comes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not come out, then administer the extraction of it with Gest, that is, finely ground Pizigarolis: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out with Gest, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a fine hook, subtly, for a short time.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out by that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear deeply, and stop up what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there is no passage except through the tube: then extract with your breath strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For it comes out many times with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If it does not come out in this manner: then take from helkalimbat, or from glue, that is, prepared gluten, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and put it at the end of the staff after you have wrapped around it a cloth decently placed: then insert it into the opening of the ear with ease, after you have cleansed the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have described, then proceed to cutting, before there occurs a hot abscess, or spasms.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of cutting is, as in phlebotomy, to make an incision in the head at first, and to extract from him blood according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fat in the place pressed upon it: and let the incision be of a crescent shape, until you reach the stone: then remove it with that which is possible for you from instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then you should sew up the wound with speed and care it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	What if a thing falls into the ear is from one of the grains, which grow and become inflamed: then administer the extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If however it does not pass out for you, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting off of that species of grains which fall into the ear and do not do that when you think that the grain is already moistened by the vapour of the ear until you put many a poultice: then extract them with forceps or with subtle instruments or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it will relieve.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water which enters into the ear, it is necessary that he uses a weak snorting with condiments at first: and now has filled his ear with some old cot: and it lies on that ear, in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, gentle, and warm them with fire for a little while, and gently put one of them into the opening of his ear: and let him hop on one foot and strike with another stone on the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	He should not therefore cease to do that with stone and stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out thus, that you take from a pomegranate or from a juniper one, and put one end of it into the ear: and burn the other end with fire until most of it is consumed.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another juniper and do that many times until all the water comes out: and extract it with a tube according to what was previously said regarding the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that enters into it, if it is small in body, such as a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I have said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large body, which appears to the sense, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its matter is easier than all those that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatment of distillations, and your treatment is not effective: then it is necessary that you examine the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If, therefore, something appears there of worms, then extract it with forceps, or with subtle hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however something does not appear there, then take a cannula, whose form is this, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the subtle extremity into the ear according to the quantity that the weak part tolerates: then suck with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do it many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If however they do not obey you to come out, then block the surroundings of the cannula with wax, as I have said concerning the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	What if they do not come out with what we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancients have already experienced in the infection of worms: and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring be what you pour oil and medicine into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver, or of brass, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it be therefore that the thing which is in the concavity of the cannula, is made from brass, turned on a lathe.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you use it, take a rod, and insert cotton into the extremity of its insertion decently: then inject oil, or juice, or what you wish of these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the rod with cotton from above, and express it by your hand with tempered compression, until the oil is poured into the concavity of the hearing, and the weak part feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear, should already be warmed with fire for a little while: and beware lest there be something which distills in it cold moisture: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of an injury to the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants are born from their mothers' wombs not pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has already happened to some men that an oblation occurred in the middle of the ear from a wound or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this oblation is sometimes made in the depth of the ear's opening, which sight does not reach: and sometimes it happens at the outer opening, and sight reaches it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	The one that happens in the depth of the ear, and which the gaze does not comprehend, is in many cases difficult to cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in the one that sight reaches, you should place the ear of the infirm person in the sun and look into it: then if you see an apparent oblation, open it with a subtle spatulum, whose form is this which follows, let its extremity be where there is a small width, of which a certain part is pointed: and the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides: so that it does not harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the oblation is from flesh born in the middle of the ear: then hold it with a subtle hook, and cut it with a vehement facility, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	What if the oblation is in the depth of the ear: then take a subtle and smooth stick, warm it with fire for a little while: then put it into the opening of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you perceive the oblation with that which the infirm person finds with heaviness of hearing, prepare its opening with facility: and beware, lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put on the ear a poultice according to the quantity of the opening's width, which you wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do that for some days, until you are secure about the consolidation of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take cotton cloth and soak it in rose water and sprinkle powdered tragacanth over it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the abscess has already formed a postule: then it is necessary to extract the cotton cloth and let it out with another cloth which you will have wrapped in cerate made with rose oil until the hot aposteme subsides: then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If there is a flow of blood: then submerge a sponge or cloths in cold water and apply it to the ear: and use the rest of the treatment that stops the flow of blood as described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Of the treatment for ulcers of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the ulcers that occur on the eyelids of the eye, when they are moist and when they are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to pull them with forceps or with a hook, and to cut them with scissors from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then apply powdered tragacanth over the place.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a sharp pointed cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Of the treatment for pimples on the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens on the eyelids something that resembles a pimple in its thickness and hardness, and because of this it is called a Grando: and it is an aggregation of thick mucus on the upper and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation for them is therefore to examine if it is a pimple proceeding from that which appears on the eyelid and moves to every part, and its treatment is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find then an incision above it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scratch it on every side with ease, until it is clean.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If however the cutting away of it is not prepared for you, unless after you have penetrated the eyelid with a small incision, then it harms the weak one in something.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	What if the incision is large: then bring it together with a suture: and treat it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no evil will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For an ointment restores it, and fleshes it over.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if a gland is turned to the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid, and hang the gland with a hook: besides which you will need an incision, and press it on every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	What if the eyelid is lengthened by an incision, it does not harm it in anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the gland, with salt water: and treat the place with that which fleshes it over, until the weak one is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a tumor which is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelid: and it happens to children mostly: and it presses on their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun, because tears flow to them, and on account of that you see them constantly wiping their faces, and they sleep with them, and their eyelids are humid under their eyebrows, which inflammation has already covered: and a visible sign of Axirnath is an elevation to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is that the weak person places their head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth, and prepare on it ligatures, and make from that ligature a circle according to the quantity that the Axirnath contains on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put it over it, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that humidity with a spatula making an incision through the width, and let not be an incision greater than what is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you cut the skin entirely, until you reach the Axirnath, for in many dispositions the Axirnath proceeds from an incision according to the shape of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract it therefore with a cloth, which you had inserted between your fingers to the exterior, and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and beware, lest you put in the incision, so that you do not reach with the spatula to the eye, and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should put a little into the incision with ease, until the Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and put them on the place, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are men who bruise salt, and put it in the concavity of the incision, so that it melts what remains of that humidity.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a hot abscess forms in the place, then treat it with cooling plasters, until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Of the modes of weakness of the eye, that is, when the eyelids become soft, whence it happens that it protrudes as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs are born in the eyelids of the eye beyond the normal hair growth, and they become long: then they harm the eye, and cause various ailments, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and a white spot, until it becomes a cause for destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir said that the cure of the eye is by four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, as has been mentioned previously in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir cures by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with a needle, as I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the weak one on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is thus turned back, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert the needle into it, where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs are born: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it back with the thread.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner part of the eyelid under the additional hairs with the spatula incident from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and put under the eyelid a small dust from cotton, or wool: then mark on top of the eyelid with ink, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	Truly it is necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: because it is already differentiated among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are some in whom it is necessary that a large quantity be cut from the eyelid, according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spatula find above the two lines that you marked, and start from the larger tear duct up to the smaller tear duct, and let there be a single incision near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scratch out the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together with a suture the two lips, with a needle and thread of fine wool: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what overflows from the threads above the two eyebrows, with certain things that irritate, if you want to do that: and if not, do not trouble.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads in place for three days, or four: afterwards attend to it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated at the time of the wound's sigillation and its closure: but the future one will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of healing was taught by the ancient ones of Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	But truly in it is solicitude for the weak, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method exists in Ataxmir also: and it is to mark on the eyelid a figure that is like the shape of the myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks, according to this shape that follows, then cut away what overflows with small forceps, according to this shape, with equality of incisions.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not suffice: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and bring together between your fingers the threads with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand to an equal elevation and elevate the skin over which the knot is marked, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and cure it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If a tumor or an aposteme occurs at your incision or your fissure: but seat that tumor with a plaster, and similar things, from sitting ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids also happen to convert their hairs.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary therefore that you use what we have said in the incision: but the suture of both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of ataxmy with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you convert the eyelid, and split the fissure which is within, according to what I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two rods, or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and the width of them is less than the width of the spatula: and you have already made an incision at the extremities of both from both parts where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then bring together both with subtlety over that which exceeds from the eyelid of the eye, and tie the two rods from both parts with a strong ligature, and leave it for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the constricted skin will die, and become black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then cure it, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is elevated: and the hairs do not puncture.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two rods, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of puncturing hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation on it is to take a thin needle and insert into it a thread of fine silk, thinly.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you will gather its extremities, and tie each node with a subtle knot: and the length of the threads is one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose on the Alinxotati another subtle thread below it briefly, and tie its extremities if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the weak one will place his head in your lap, and it should be near the sun as it declares the operation: since it is a subtle operation, or a minute one.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you extract from above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up to the thread of the Alinxotati: and insert into the Alinxotati that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair goes out with the Alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If the Alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not go out with it: pull the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you composed in it, until the Alinxotati goes out from the upper opening, and you see it with the sight of the eye: then you pull the Alinxotati, and the thread: and extract both, and close the eye: and keep it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh is born above it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from the natural hairs, and raise it with that: or leave it until it grows out after a space, and then raise it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Of the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this affliction occurs to the eye, it is called Leporina by Alxatrati.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either a natural or an accidental one.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	An accidental one is made from the consolidation of a wound, or from a cut, or from a cauterization, and similar things to these.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment for it is that you find that consolidation and that you separate its lips and that you put between them a linen pad, and bind it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not fitting to use in the treatment of it things which dry and constrict, for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was; but rather use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek: and apply with water, in which the althea has been cooked, linseed: and anoint with dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap with that linen, and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all ingenuity, that it not consolidate, according to the shape which it was initially.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have spoken of, is not but a certain correction of the Alxatrati, so that the shape of the place does not return according to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs on the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkle or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below is what is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is made from a wound, or a tear, or a cauterization, and similar things to these.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation for it is that you take a needle, on which there is double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread passes through both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with a needle, and cut it with a spatula on the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the figure of the eyelid returns according to what is proper, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a rasp, and put it in the cleft, and convert the eyelid with it: and find two clefts on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two clefts be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is formed from them: until when they are gathered this figure is formed, and it is the letter lauda in Greek.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh to the amount which is its sharp lower side from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts, and sew it with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, with softening medicines and bandages, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a crust forms from the cleft and suture or burn, then it is necessary that you find a flat cleft under the hair of the eyelids, also according to what has happened previously.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the discussion on the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that it runs in this operation, according to what is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	It itself is of many diversities in form: and the prudent artificer prepares his skill with whatever method is possible for him, so that he makes it return to the natural figure, or near it, and the infirmity itself, according to what is convenient for him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the eye with the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many men, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the whiteness of the eye, and it prevents the same from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore you should insert the extremity of the spatula under the eyelid and raise it up, or stretch it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a subtle spatula, which is not sharp at the point of the incision, but rather dull for a short time: so that the weak one is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and cuts the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you excise the adhesion with facility, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Pour then into the eye salty water, with water to wash it: or instill into it from a syringe made thus, from dissolved lye with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen thread: and put over the eye a woolen cloth soaked in the whiteness of the eye: and use it for three days with dressings, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the incision of the nail and the elevation of the flesh of the tear ducts.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nerveless: and is similar to a subtle, hard callus.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerveless, similar to the humidity of frozen white matter: which when it touches iron, or a hook tries to seize it, it is cut off, and the hook does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin except from the larger tear duct, until which it goes gradually, until it covers the use, and prevents the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is: that the weak person should put his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with the pincers of a pair of forceps, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert in it a horse hair or an ox hair, or a cow hair: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle for a little while, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the thread the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were to sew it with the thread up to its posterior.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a subtle spatula, or with small forceps: and remove the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that it does not happen from the cutting that there is a frequent flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with pincers alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then let it be scraped with a gentle spatula, of which this is the shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the spatula touch the cornial tunic, and there happen to it a rupture, and the pupil be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, cast into the eye something of ground salt, or made from zinc oxide, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	For if the nail is not nerotic, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor can a pincer be fixed in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicines, and healed as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	For if you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the weak person, and take a subtle, gentle, and fine-pointed spatula, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scratch the nail from above with subtle scraping.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	What if you see that it itself becomes rarefied and broken, and the scraping impresses on it, then distill from your hour on the eye of what has been done with lye or with red or with rough salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation over it, until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in your eye to the contrary: then cease that, and cure the abscess, until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with scraping, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The flesh of the tear duct, if it harms the eye with great annoyance, should be suspended with a hook, and a portion of it cut away: and let not the cutting be ultimate, so that the flow of tears is not interrupted.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then pour into the tear duct either red orpiment, or made from lime, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision of the cataract, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	There is born in certain eyes of men a red flesh, composed or overlaid, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps converts the eyelids to the outside: and it is like the rose of the pomegranate.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for it is also that the weak one places his head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with hooks converging to it: and hold it with one forceps or tongs.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until the whole of it is finished with the incision.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so that you do not harm it during the operation: and let your incision be what you cut with, or with the spatula, which we described in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which the hazel is collected, according to the form it will take after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When the wound is completely healed and all the alguardenici has been removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt or distill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines, and put on top of the eye a poultice made with egg white.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If some alguardenici remains and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot aposteme: then leave the eye, and cure it with what settles the aposteme.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the operation until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do likewise for the flesh that grows on the eye from this condition.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you should omit the cure of the whole weak eye from natural or accidental cause, by operating with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that the member can tolerate that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the collection of pus from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Pus is a red vein that forms over the eye, and prevents the sight from performing its function: and weakens the eye with the passage of time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary therefore for you first to consider if the eye in which there is pus, is strong and does not have any sickness except for the pus: then collect its pus.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is that you should instruct the weak person to put their head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your wisdom: and let the hook be subtle for duplication, according to this shape, or let there be two hooks graduated on one body, according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with subtle forceps with subtlety, and remove the blood hour after hour, until you see that the veins are removed from the eye, and dissolved: and beware lest you damage the eye with the extremities of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and you should be firm in your operation indeed: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have excavated, then pour into the eye a green or red liquid: so that its acidity eats away what remains of the cataract.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for some days, until the pain is soothed: and it is secured from a hot abscess: then repeat over it the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Of the reduction of the nose to its proper shape.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call it Arissat's fistula, which you will treat with a cautery, or with a medicine of burning acid, according to what its description has previously stated.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no ingenuity in it: unless you find a collection of pus above the abscess at its birth, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see in it a corruption or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called a head scraper.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made from Indian iron, and let its head be round like a grindstone, which is dotted with the dotting of a file, or the dotting of a fine awl: and place it over the corrupted place of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it between your fingers, and you press your hand for a little while, until you know that the corruption has already been scraped: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicines of contracting and astringent qualities.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of blood is stopped: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and is not complicated, and no accident occurs in it: then you should know that it has already healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no ingenuity in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this method.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you scrape the bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is scraped, then take an instrument according to this method, let it be a metal extremity, triangular: and its wood be a pyramid extended up to the extremity, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then put that on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and stretch out your hand from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the instrument, until it penetrates the bone, and the weaker one feels it: by which he finds the wind to exit from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Then restore the place with medicines that dry and constrict, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh grows, and the place becomes hardened: then the matter that was flowing to the outside, returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter on the weaker one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of the prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the Eye protrudes with its entire mass, and no harm occurs to the sight, nor diminution: then it is necessary that you release the weaker one: then you bleed it: afterwards you put cups on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put on the Eye an ointment that is made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the Eye above with a plaster with many powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of bandages is: that you take soft cloths, many, and double every cloth from them over four; make many of them; then put them one on top of another, a second according to the quantity which the Eye needs; then tie over them with a hard cloth tightly bound.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the applications with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the bandages and loosen the eye by day and by night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the ligament is again softened, then it is necessary that it be tied much; then remove the ligament after a day and a night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye has already returned to its own tunics, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, and bandages, and binding, and applications, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the incision of the conjunctiva.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When there occurs a disruption in the conjunctiva, then it protrudes and proceeds out of the eyelids like a grain of the conjunctiva, and the form of the man is disfigured because of that, and one must make an incision on it: then the operation on it is, according to what I relate; and it is, that you insert the needle at the root of the conjunctiva from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle where there is a double thread on the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate; and let the first needle remain according to its own disposition.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the conjunctiva around the needle; and tie it very tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then pull out the needle, and put over the eye a soft wool on the white of the eyeball; and leave it there until the thread falls away with the conjunctiva.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with that which comforts it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when a suture is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is perforated with a subtle spatula, which penetrates to the depth of the eye, and the white humidity flows out, and the eye descends, and immediately enters: then it is tightened, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of Cataracts.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnati, is not but a cloudiness, which gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is, that you make the weak person sit on a prepared seat, or a directed one.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head of it with your hands on both sides, and move it, until you see the cloudiness penetrate to the lower parts of the eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is fixed, and does not descend, and the light is freed: and the weak person sees things as he used to see: and if it does not descend below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the descent of the cloudiness is not prepared with what we have said, then make the weak person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a subtle spatula, and probe with it above the corneal membrane slightly at the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the corona, until the cloudiness comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then let it be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of the water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken of the type of water in division, and what is suitable for perforating, as the discourse declares and explains, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you should make the weak person sit between your hands in a square shape, opposite the light, near the torch: and bind his healthy eye, and pull it strongly: then with your right hand touch the eyelid of his eye, if the eye that has water is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand the cotton, if the eye is the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the cotton near the crown through the thickness of the radius in the same white part of the eye visible with a lesser tear duct: then push the cotton with force: and you rotate it with your hand, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the cotton has now reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the length of the journey of the cotton to the depth be the length of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see it in the same pupil of the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the cotton to the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then the water descends at once, then the weak person sees that thing above which he opens his vision at once, and the cotton in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then the water descends, then put it down secondly, except that the cotton goes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is thus fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the cotton with ease: and you rotate your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in the water something from clear rock salt: and wash the eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside the eye the whole poultice, or a cloth soaked in rose oil, and the whites of the eye: and tie it with that to the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, however, and those who are of our time, put on top a layer of beaten cumin with the whites of the eye.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	What if the magda does not penetrate to the entrance of the eye on account of its hardness, because it is from humans, whose eye is very hard: then you should take a spatula, which is called Alberid, this being its form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Make a perforation with it therefore to the conjunctiva itself as much as possible, and do not put your hand in the opening: and it is not but that you make a way to the magda place subtly.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the magda, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your operation, prepare for the weak person a dormitory decently made, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark house: and prohibit him from all movements, and from coughing: and give him food that soothes his nature: and let him not move his head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark house, and try his vision: and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then put back the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary to do that at the time of curing, or immediately after the incision: but rather, it is necessary to avoid that: because water ascends quickly through vehement sight.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If however a hot apostema occurs: then it is necessary to release the eye before the seventh: and treat it with that which calms the apostema, until it is calmed: then free its vision, and put on its face an oral remedy which regulates its vision for some days, it being in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should go out from the house gradually and return to his own home.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that a disciple is not excused from witnessing several times on the operation for then he will be confident over the procedure.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed there has come to us one of them who are from Alayrach, who said that a perforated magdan was made in Alayrach through which water is sucked.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	For I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of types from a magda, so that one who is ignorant of them will stand upon them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from their own copper: and let their extremities be with the same subtlety triangular, and the extremities pointed.
Formae magda.	Forms of a magda.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the treatment of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes there are born in the nose diverse fleshes added to it, among which there is something that resembles a scorpion of many feet: and from it is flesh cancerous, stone-like, of dark color: and from it is what is flesh soft, not of dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In the one therefore which is from these fleshes soft, not deceptive, nor cancerous, you should make the weak one sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and thrust a hook into those fleshes: then draw them to the outside, and cut what you have grasped of them with a subtle sharp spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	What if something remains of it whose removal is not possible: then scrape that with one of the subtle instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If however the blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs: then apply to it what is necessary: or it is one of the malignant abscesses, then cauterize him quickly, until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then vinegar and water, or wine, should be thrown into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If however the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then know that he is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If however the moisture does not penetrate according to what is necessary, then know that there is rotten flesh inside it in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then therefore it is necessary that you insert a thread of linen which has some thickness, and knots on it many knots: and put between each knot the quantity of a finger, or less: and let the weak one push, so that he puts one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or with what is possible for him after he made something similar to adzer: and pull his smelling thing, until it reaches up to the caassum, and comes out above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times indeed do boys similar to this in schools of Atto: and it is an easy thing for one who wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then put the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then as a servant cut the flesh with the sawing of the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already caught with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread: and put into the nose after wiping away the blood a linen cloth which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put at the end of the thing a tin pipe into the nose, for some days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If it needs a cure which will dry it out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making a head purging, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or of brass: which should be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed pipe, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell-like instrument for making a head purging, should be full, and uncovered: which should have a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil in it, or whatever you want from juices, and flowing things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of nasal polyp.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	A polyp often grows at the end of the nose and increases and grows with time until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that, it is necessary to remove it at the beginning of its appearance and eradicate all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put on the place a cautery or a medicine that burns which stands in place of it.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If the cutting of it is delayed until it becomes large, then consider if it is stony, hard, of a dark color, of little feeling: then do not touch it with iron: because it is a cancerous aposteme.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen that he who cut a bad aposteme, and it happened from it a great evil to the man who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the aposteme is of a soft touch, not of a dark color, and you see that cutting is possible in all of it, then evacuate the weak part, and cut it without fear, without anxiety: and treat the place with what dries and constricts, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	We know that when there is a solution of continuity in one of these cartilages, the operation is not very reliable, except in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore when anything of that sort happens to someone, that you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then bring the lips of the wound together with a suture, afterwards treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the separation are already separated, and each part has become healthy, then it is necessary that you should scratch out every part from its own skin until it becomes bloody.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bring the two lips together with a suture, and tie them, and powder over it the blood of dragon, and ground frankincense: and put over the powders a piece of Diafiac plaster, or some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it tied for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then untie it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads come apart by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of the suture is that you bring together the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have described in the suture of the belly: or bring together the separation with a thread, as I have made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of knots of the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many men have lumps occurring inside their lips, hard excrescences like grains of herb, and some of them are small and others large.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you should turn back the lip, and find the lump, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it on every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with a powdered zeolite, until blood is stanched.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then let it be wrapped with vinegar, and the place where there is a styptic be treated with it, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the cutting of the flesh born above the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Frequently there grows above the gum a flesh that the ancients call bullock or alveus, but which we name "addiat".
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It is necessary therefore that you suspend it with a hook, or that you hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on the place zeeg powder crushed, or other powders styptic and astringent.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	For if that flesh returns after the treatment, for it often returns, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes there collect on the surfaces of teeth from the inside and outside part, and between the gums rough, foul, and blackened cortices, and sometimes they become stained, and yellow, and green, until corruption comes from that to the gum, and the teeth become foul through it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary therefore that you make the weak person sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, in which there appear to you rough cortices, and things similar to sand: until nothing of them remains, and do likewise with the blackness, and greenness, and yellowness, and other things until they are clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is in them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good: and if not, then repeat the scraping over them on one day, and on a second, and on a third, until at last there comes a stop to it in that which you use.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that the tooth requires razors of diverse forms and many figures, according to which your operation is prepared: namely, that the razor with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the razor with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors should be prepared by you, which you will use.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you treat the tooth for its pain with all ingenuity, and delay in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not that the vicinity of the tooth supplies it when it is extracted: since it is a subtle substance: until when there is no excuse for extracting it, then it is necessary when the weak one is forced to extract it, so that it is strengthened and certified by you, the aching tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the pain deceives the weak person, and he thinks it is in a sound tooth and extracts it: then the pain does not go away, until the diseased tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of bloodletting practitioners.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the aching tooth is certified by you itself, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides: then move it with your fingers or with subtle forceps at first little by little, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in it, with good positioning, and hold the weak head between your knees: which you have already held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to straightness, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under the tooth from all sides with ease, and constrain its movement, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the dense is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a cloth and tie it with a thin thread of a radius, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction on it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you act carefully with scarification around the gum on all sides abundantly.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and it returns over the weakness from that evil which is greater than its pain at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and boldness over the eradication of it, beyond what we have administered.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause great weaknesses to come upon men, which are difficult to break, and all the roots of it remain, or some of them: or so that they extract it with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often testified to that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then let it be glued after the eradication of it with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	What if a flow of blood happens from the places (for it often happens) then take something of gum and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the gum does not adhere to you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shape of the thin forceps which move the dense at first, should be of long extremities, short handles, thick, so that they do not double when pressed with them on a tooth: they should be as you see of thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not release themselves, nor double: of short extremities, and let them be made from iron or wrought and properly made iron, with straight extremities: and in their extremities let there be teeth, some of which enter into others, and squeeze with a decent constriction, strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the extremities are formed in the shape of a parrot's beak, which is called ciconia, and they are of strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains after the eradication of a tooth that breaks, then it is necessary to put a cloth soaked in butter on the spot for one or two days, until the area softens: then insert into it forceps or tongs: whose extremities are similar to a parrot's beak which is called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This form indeed is of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their extremities be made like file or like toothpicks.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If then it does not come out for you with these forceps, then it is necessary that you dissecet above the root and remove all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small lever, whose shape is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let its extremity be short, somewhat thick: and let it not be fragile, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If then the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to use with these other instruments whose shapes are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first one has a triangular extremity, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the triangular extremity is slender.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And also use with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and iron tools which preceded in the rasping of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And also use with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this shape, triangular twisted extremity, in which there is a certain thickness, so that it does not break: and let it not be fragile.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that the instruments of teeth are many: and similarly the rest of the instruments are not accounted for, and the skilled artisan, subtle in his art, finds by himself the instrument, according to which he signifies to himself the operation and the difficulties.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since there are pains for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If the bone is broken from the jaw or from other bones of the mouth, or becomes putrid: then probe over it in its place with that which suits it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a gest, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be in it something of thickness little by little, so that it may be tightened, or the bone may be held with it, and it does not flee and is steady, until the bone goes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is rottenness in the bone, then scrape the bone itself from its rottenness, and cure it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the sawing of prominent teeth above the others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth do not protrude according to their natural course, a foul shape is made by it: and especially when this happens in women, and girls, namely those with venereal ailments.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and does not have a place, or it is possible for its sawing, nor its smoothing: then extract it: and if it is connected to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made from Indian iron, of sharp extremity, strongly.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cutting be that which you cut with it for many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that another of the teeth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is prominent and exposed for its smoothing: then smooth it with a file made from Indian iron, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely made from Indian iron, and its handle smaller by a few points, strongly: like a file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is smoothed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed and falls: then clean it, and finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	What if it is dense, from which a part will be broken and it injures the tongue: then it is necessary to smooth it also, until the roughness of that breaking is removed, and it is made even, and flattened, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Of the gold wire filling of teeth.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth undergo a concussion and commotion from a blow or a fall: and the weak one cannot chew on what he eats so that it does not fall: and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment was not effective: then the idea for them is to be fastened with a gold wire: because silver turns green and putrefies after days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be moderate in fineness and thickness according to the quantity that it can hold between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the filling is that you take the thread and insert double its length between two healthy teeth: then weave with both ends of the thread between the moved teeth, whether it is one or several, until you come with the web to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving until the part from which you began: and pull your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not moved forward: and let your constriction by which you tighten the thread be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not protrude.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the overflowing ends of the thread with scissors: and gather both, and shape them with forceps: and hide them between a healthy tooth and a moved tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue: then let it be thus tightened while it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it becomes loose or is cut, tighten them with another thread, and it will stand with that for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the filling of two healthy teeth, and two moved teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it happens that one or two teeth fall out after the removal of each and they are retained in their places as we have described, and remain; and this is not done except by a skilled and experienced artisan.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when something is fitted from the bones of the jaw and made into the shape of a tooth, and put in the place where the tooth was lost and tied as we have said, and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes the ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is to open the mouth of the weak one on your lap, and elevate their tongue: then cut that nervous ligament across its width, until the tongue is freed from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	What if there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then put a hook into it, and cut across its width, until you cut the ligament and the knot is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a fissure in the depth of the flesh, and you cut the artery there, and there occurs a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then let the area of the incision be colluted with rose water, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a plaster of flax, which the weak one should hold all night, so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however there occurs a flow of blood, then put on the place powdered gum.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a lenitive cauter, which is suitable for it: then treat it with the remainder of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the removal of the Ranula that occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes there occurs under the tongue an aposteme resembling a small frog, which prevents the tongue from performing its natural function, and perhaps grows to such an extent that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation for this is to open the mouth of the invalid before you, and examine the aposteme.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If you see that it is of a dark or black color, and hard, and the invalid has lost sensation in it, then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it inclines to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then apply a hook to it, and cut it with a subtle spatula, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	What if blood gushes out during your operation, then put over it pounded alum, until the bleeding stops: then return to your operation, until you extract it with its appendage.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be cleansed with vinegar and salt: and treat it with the rest of the treatment suitable for that, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the cure of an aposteme of two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur in the throat two glands, that is, tonsils, which resemble two almonds, which occur at the back of the throat: and are called two Amigdalae: which when you treat with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is a hard aposteme, of dark color, with little sensation, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red color, and its root is thick, then do not touch it with iron either, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will perforate it or it will rupture by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is subtle: then it should be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, that you consider before its operation, if the apostema of its tumor has completed quiet heat, or is diminished by some diminution: then make the weak sit in front of the sun, and its head be in your bosom: and open its mouth, and the servant receives between his hands, and presses its tongue below with an instrument, which has this form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made from silver, or copper, which is subtle like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When I press the tongue with it, and the tumor is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and extract it to the exterior as much as you can, except that you draw with it something from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, which has this form that follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is assimilated to forceps: nevertheless its extremities are curved, so that the orifice of each of them is directly opposite the other's point: hence take care that it be made from iron or tempered steel.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not at hand, then cut it with a spatula, which has this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same species of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the cutting, let the weak person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there happens to him a flow of blood, let him gargle with water in which the barks of pomegranates have been boiled: or leaves of myrtle, and similar things from astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped: then take care of him, until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And whenever abscesses appear in the throat besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut them therefore equally as I have said in the cutting of the two tonsils.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I indeed have already treated a woman for an abscess that had formed in her throat, which was pulling towards the trachea, with little sensation, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already forbidden her both food and water: and she would have reached death, if she had remained one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, until they went out above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I proceeded therefore with haste, and I fixed a hook on one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion was pulled out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where it was grasped coming out of the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to it what had come out of the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess: then I cut off from it a part of it, and there did not flow out from it except a little blood: therefore the throat of the woman was cured, and she began at once to drink water, then she took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not therefore cease to cut into that abscess many times for a long time: and the abscess was succeeding in the place of what I had cut, until it was prolonged too much and with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I heated therefore, and cauterized the abscess in the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood therefore from increasing: then I walked away from the place, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Of the cutting of the abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the cold descends to the gum and becomes an abscess and is long: then it itself is called perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it itself is called a gum boil.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not work: and you see that the hot abscess has quieted from it, and is subtle: then it is necessary to cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is gathered from it round, and is not in length, and is bloody, or of a dark reddish color, or black, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to avoid cutting it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear regarding the weak place.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore when you see it according to the measure which I spoke of from its whiteness, and its length, that you make the weak one sit before the sun: and press its tongue with an instrument, whose description has preceded: then fix a hook in the gum, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of the two instruments which I have spoken of in the cutting of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the cutting use that which we have described in the cutting of the two tonsils: and treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the weak one trembles from the cutting: then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization on it is not, except with sharp water: and it is, that you put the head of the weak one in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press its tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with lime that is not extinguished, and put it not thick, nor subtle, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, whose form is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremities of it in which the medicine is placed be hollow, like the hollow of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And put the instrument with the medicine on the wound itself: and let the weak person be lying on their side, so that saliva runs out of their mouth from the inward medicine, so that nothing from it descends to their throat, and harms them.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you apply it to the wound for the first time in the quantity of a half hour, until you see that it is already blackened and the biting of the medicine has sat.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take a piece of cloth, and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and dip the cloth in medicine, and insert the radius with the cloth into the tube above, until the cloth adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it alone: for it will dry out and fall off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	What if you judge that you should repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization cleanse around the wound with a cloth soaked in butter, and purify what is around it from the medicine: and wash with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated outwardly with poultices, and inwardly with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This species of cure is healthier than incision and less frightening.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the wound is treated with what is more subtle than cauterization and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamentum, and hyssopum, and origanum, and rue, and ssacah, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar things from the herbs: and gather all of them, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be covered with a decent lute: and let there be in the middle of the pot an opening, over which an instrument concave is placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made from silver, or bronze: and the extremity is introduced, in which there is a grain, into the mouth of the infirm, until the vapor ascends to the palate over the tube, until the palate becomes very obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then let it be rubbed repeatedly over the same spot, until it is scratched.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you make this cure at the beginning of the appearance of the apostema.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For a plaster adds to the apostema: and it is not necessary that you do that unless at the decline of the heat of the apostema.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not present to you, then take a cane, and place the bark of an oak on the extremity of it: so that the mouth of the infirm does not become scorched: for the bark of the oak prevents the vapor from scorching the mouth: and this is from good cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Of the extraction of thorns, and bones from the jaw.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times a bone, or a fishbone, or something else sticks to the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore that you extract what of them is apparent on which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument at the seat, and it is revealed to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the infirm vomit before it is digested by the foods in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For a foreign body will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the weak person swallow a piece of nap, or a root of lettuce, or let him swallow a small piece of dry bread: or let him take a piece of dried sea sponge and tie it with a thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it reaches the place where are the spine or bone, and is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument made of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a Rod a little, and at its end let there be a curvature, which it introduces into the throat with ease: and let it have its head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let it beware of the touch of its epiglottis, so that coughing does not happen to it, and let it push the mouth, or bone, or let the doctor introduce it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the weak person introduces, this is better: on account of his knowledge of the place of the annexed thing: and he pushes downwards, or pulls his hand with an instrument upwards, all that according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of a bloodsucking creature.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a bloodsucking creature is treated with what I said in the division on curation with medicines, and it does not work, then consider in the throat of the weak person before the sun, or at the sun after you press his tongue with an instrument that I have described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your sight then falls upon the bloodsucking creature, extract it with a small hook, or with delicate fingers.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	What if it is not possible with these: then take a concave tube, and introduce it into the throat of the weak person until near the throat: then introduce into the concavity of the tube ignited iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Let him do that many times, and let the weak man abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full drink of cold water, and open his mouth in it, and let him spit out the water, and not swallow anything of it, and let him move the water with one hand after another.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For a leech indeed falls when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the weak person with cemephis, or with ase with an instrument that I described for fumigating the womb.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, because it itself will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which there are burning prunes of a womb with fire, and the pot is covered with a cover, in whose middle there is a hole, and let the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw in the fumigation, and let the weak person put his mouth on the end of the cannula, and let him close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not come out, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	Because if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the weak person endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that it comes out with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls onto the same sight.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see, except that it has this curvature which is introduced into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to a bird's beak, which is called cicoria, in which there is roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses and their cutting and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of many modes, according to which the treatment of them is remembered, namely one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in the perforation of them, and their cutting from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is from the species of abscesses in itself, and that which it comprises of humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is because of the places, in which it happens in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess happening on the head is different from an abscess happening on the anus: and an abscess happening in a fleshy place is different from an abscess happening on the joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of the abscesses there are some which should not be perforated, unless after the maturation of the pus in them and its completion: and of them there are some which should be perforated while they are raw and do not mature according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an abscess happens near a joint and its existence is prolonged until the putrefaction of what is in its surroundings perhaps corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, which is a cause of more likely contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member: for if you delay the perforation of it until it matures, it will harm either that or through that principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, perforate it therefore while it is immature: and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, unless that which is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its termination what does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of the perforation of the apostema, which has matured according to its completion: and it is at the sedation of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the apostema: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the apostema, and of the more prominent elevation: and let the perforation be going in the length of the body, if the apostemata are in the parts of the hands and feet, and the places of the armpits, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and at last in all equal places, to which there is not a reflexion.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those however which are reflected, let it go with the perforation according to that membrane.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the apostema is in fleshy places, then it is better that you omit its perforation, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to its completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, the course of the pus is prolonged from it, and there is much filth and foulness, and perhaps the lips of it will become hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some apostemata are perforated according to the width of the body, by necessity: or according to that which the membrane needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer in small apostemata a small perforation, and in large apostemata a large perforation: or many sections by similarity of the magnitude of the apostema.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are of the apostemata, in which it is necessary that the skin be concave: and let it be cut when already it has been made like a cloth, and it has been made at the end, which already is dead: as that which happens to many, such as buboes and dubelles.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And of them there are those which cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from them is that from which an incision is made as the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an abscess in the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from them are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered, and similar to them from the incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That one indeed which has no head, as are lenient superficial abscesses, ought to be pierced by a superficial piercing, or only a flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is thick, and has already collected much purulent matter, and you pierce it, that you not hurry and extract all the pus at that hour: but rather extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then stop up the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do that many times according to the gradation, until it goes out: especially if he is weak and of little strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit man: for the vital spirit is often resolved from the animal with the going out of pus: and perhaps the weak person dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Beware therefore this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your piercing, by which you pierce the abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and take care.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then administer dressings made from linen, or old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and there are many openings of the piercing, it is necessary then that you insert a dressing into every opening, until they reach the bottom.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, or have hollowed it out around: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when a fabric is woven, or wool from linen without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then anoint it, and treat it with what is necessary from the ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	And if there occurs a flow of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which the cloth is soaked in them: and you put it on the place of the flow of blood many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	And if the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary that you administer a treatment and a cure and powders, which I have described in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	And if it is in the time of winter, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you pour in powders with wine, and hot oil: and you put them on the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you put powders soaked in water, and oil, or wine and oil, and all of that is cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you loosen the abscess, and clean it, and administer in its cure what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the cure of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess, in what way it is a path to its cure, chapter by chapter, individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the section of abscesses which occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	There occur on the skin of the head small abscesses, and they are of the species of Knots, which are contained in sacs, and these are attached to them: as if they themselves were husks of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their species are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty: and some of them contain humidity similar to slime: and some of them contain humidity similar to friction and poultices: and similar things, and some of them are hard stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the cutting of all, and their extraction, there is no fear, provided that in their cutting it does not cause a contrariness of the arteries.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their cutting is that you try them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains humidity, then dry it by a cut according to the length of the superficial cut: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with a cut from line b to line g. When therefore the humidity is evacuated, then scratch out the cyst which contains that humidity, and do not leave anything of it deeply.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it returns many times, if something of it remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then submerge the wound in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it corrodes what remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over the wound with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you apply it to it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then treat the wound with ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	What if the apostema contains a fatty knot: then cut it according to this form, having the form of a cross: and apply ointment between the lips of the incision, and scratch it out from every part: and examine your skill in the extraction of the tunic which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however the artery makes a contrariness to you, then do that which I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do similarly in the case of a stone, from cutting and cure, the same as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the cutting over a stone apostema is easier: since there is little blood and humidity.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And whenever there are certain apostemata which are on the head in certain men, with which there is not deep humidity.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is: that I cut into an apostema on the head of an old woman, and I found the apostema like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if anyone were to strike it by throwing something at it, it would wound.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other accidental apostemata on the head, apart from these, namely the apostemata which occur on the heads of boys, and at the roots of the ears, let the dissection of all of them be a superficial dissection.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation of them always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of blood may be alleviated to the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat it with what is suitable for it from the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the dissection of Tumors on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These apostemata often occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur on the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above those which occur on the neck, there is one, and many: and they are generated from the nearby area: and every tumor of them is inside its own proper tunic, as it is in knots and apostemata of the head, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these Tumors.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them are some that are stony: and among them are those which contain humors: and among them are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in that one which you see among them of good disposition to the touch, whose manifest proximity is to the color of the skin, and it moves in every part, and it is not attached with the nerves of the neck, nor with the gullet, nor with the artery, nor is it deep: it is necessary that you dissect it with a superficial dissection from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line, and along the line, and extract it from every part: and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need them, as we have said in the case of apostemata of the head, and extract it little by little.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is above the caution, that the vein or nerve is not cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the spatula be not sharp, so that it does not add your hand to the incision, or disturb the weak, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you cut the vein, or artery, it prohibits you from operation, then put on the wound pounded zegi, or some powders that absorb blood, and tighten the wound, and leave it, until the sharpness of the swelling subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is absorbed by a tunic of flesh, therefore return to your operation, until you finish.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your index finger, if anything remains of the small spurs: therefore cut them, and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	What if there is in the root of the spur a large vein: then it is necessary that you do not cut that spur from its root: but rather it is necessary that you tie it with a double strong thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you have already steeped in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire spur is cut, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and sew them immediately, after which you see that nothing protrudes in excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that something remains in excess because of the size of the spur, then it is necessary that you proceed to cut its root, and extract it: and administer the suture which we mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what of the spurs contains humidity, pierce it with a superficial piercing: so that the place of its maturation appears to you: and put the piercing from that which follows below the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer a dressing with an ointment after the perforation, and similar things to it, so that it corrodes what remains from the corruption, until when you see the wound is already clean: then treat it with a generating ointment of flesh, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Of the cutting of the epiglottis by an abscess that occurs within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this incision on the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it: and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those having synanche, it is necessary that the incision of the Epiglottis be deviated: since no passage can be made through it: because all the veins and the lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those indeed who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use the incision of the Epiglottis, to flee from the destruction which is made by the suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary therefore when we wish it, that we cut the Epiglottis under three circles of the Epiglottis, or four, a small incision in width, in what is between two circles in quantity, so that the incision is in the sifac, not in the cartilage: and this place indeed is convenient for the incision, because it is deprived of flesh, and the vessels of blood from it are distant.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	What if the doctor is timid, then it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then let him pierce the skin, until when he reaches the canal: let him divert the vessels of blood, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then let him cut the sifac which we have described: and it is indicated above the incision of the canal from the phlegm that exits from it, with what disrupts it, and from the cutting off of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the hour arrives in which the anointing is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and suture it itself alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medications which make flesh grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Said Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this speech which we have narrated is not an exposition, except when they see that one of these apostemata has already strangled the throat of the weak; and the weak has been lifted up from death, and his breaths are about to be cut off: they proceed to cut the Epiglottis, so that the weak may breathe over the place of the wound by some breathing, and may be saved from death: and for this reason they have ordered to leave the wound open, until the evil of the disease is consumed, and its evil is for three days, or thereabouts; then therefore they have ordered to suture the wound, and to treat it, until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I have seen with my own eyes is, that a certain servant girl took a knife, and thrust it into her throat, and cut the part of the canal of the lung.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to the cure of her, and I found her to rattle, as is the rattling of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I probed therefore from the wound, and I found blood which had come out from the wound a little.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was confused therefore that she had not cut the vein, nor the trachea: and the air came out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I treated therefore the wound and her wound, and I cured it, until it was sound: and nothing happened to the servant girl, except hoarseness of voice: and she returned after days to her better dispositions.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Hence therefore I say: that in the cutting of the Epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the surgical incision of the throat hernia
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This condition called hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, secondary to body color, and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is secondary to two methods: for it is either natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one certainly there is no ingenuity.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, however, is secondary to two methods: of which one is similar to fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other method is similar to an abscess that forms from a knotting of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it is not suitable that a presumption be made regarding it with iron, unless in that which is small: and you will examine it, and investigate it with an introduction.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty knot, and it is not suspended with any vein: then cut it, as knots are cut: and extract it with what it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then probe the whole of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with what is proper for the cure, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the surgical incision of the type of knots.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of knots, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division: and it is necessary that I describe here the difference between a Knot and an Excrescence: since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when there is an Excrescence, there is heat, and fever, and vehement pains, until the ebullition of the surplus is satiated, and the putrefaction is complete: then indeed the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	With a Knot, however, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them in cysts, which is their proper sac, and it is secondary to body color: and its shape is like a seed, and it forms like a boil, and it is larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are divided into two types: either fatty or containing humidity.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary therefore, when you come to the cure of a Knot, that you try it, and examine it first with an instrument which is called Intromissum, according to which its form will appear in the chapter which is after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining abscesses and all Knots is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you move your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then you put your hand finally according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then you extract the Intromissum, and examine what comes out in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a running humidity comes out, whatever the color may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, according to what I said concerning other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if humidity does not come out in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty: dry therefore above it with an incision having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scratch the skin from every side with ease: and guard the kistin if you can above it, so that you extract it healthy with the Knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If however the kistis bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it by fragments, until nothing of it remains.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or much of it remains, the Knot returns according to the amount.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it overcomes you and a little of it remains: then fill the wound at the completion with certain corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and put on top of it what sits on the abscess, a hot application, and treat it with the remaining cure, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If it is a large knot, then sew its two lips, and cure it with what flesh grows around it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If there is a contrary vein, either pulsating or not pulsating: then press, and fill the place of the zegi with trito, and leave it tied for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies, and the ebullition of blood quiets down: afterwards return to cut that which remains of the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	On the forms of instruments for cutting and boring.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	These are the forms of the introdgers, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made from iron of Al-fulud, a quadrangular shape at the extremities, so that they fasten the entry into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the Experients, and yes, that is, the perforators: and one of them is named beris, that is, the perforator: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are joined so that they investigate through them the abscesses and the exits and the fistulas and the buboes from what is between them of bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, slender, like large needles with which they sew under the skin, namely of citrus, or of copper, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones of them are those that are made from citrus.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And they make the Experients also from black lead, which are joined so that through them they investigate the fistulas, whose concavities are reflections, so that they reflect with their slenderness together with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Since some of them are long, some of them are medium, and some of them are short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its stricture.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The forms of ulcers, and they are of many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Since some of them are simple, namely those which have one curvature: and they are of three species, as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And some of them are blind ulcers: and they are of three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And some of them are ulcers having two curvatures, and they are of three species: and some of them are ulcers having three curvatures, and they are of three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which they cut and excavate knots and apostems: and they are of three species: since some of them are large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which a section is made are acute, the other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed thus, except so that with them there is a judgment in the excavation of knots regarding the fear of cutting a vein, or nerve: and so that it may be healed by this, and it finds tranquility for a time from the burning which it found at the excavation of an apostem.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are forceps, and they are of three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of copper, and they are similar to a file, with which the file is sharpened: and on the broad extremity there is a point of Spatumilis hidden: and in it there runs to the interior and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of Spatumilis which are hidden between the fingers for the perforation of apostems: and the weak do not perceive them: and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of cauteries with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They should be made from bronze or brass, rounded, and a little long, as you see: and they should be to subtlety.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is fitting that you should have those kinds of large and small bloodletting instruments: so that you can cut blood with speed when necessary, and then when medicine is not present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	But you should not use them for bloodletting in every part of the body, and you should not use them except in fleshy places: such as the arms, thighs, hips, upper arms, breasts, belly, groin, and similar ones to these, from the fleshy arms, humid.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes small instruments similar to the rinds of gourds are made from them, according to their shape: with which blood is cut when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the cutting of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made rounded according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the treatment of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men become inflamed during their sleep (that is, when they begin to have an emission in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts: and they remain as foul apostumes.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	He who therefore abhors that, should cut above the breast in a lunar section, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then scratch out all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill the wound with incarnate medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and cure it, until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If the breast however declines to the lower parts and becomes soft because of its size, as it happens with women: then it is necessary that two sections similar in figure to the moon be found on its two upper sides, each of which is connected to the other at both ends, until there is a greater line containing the lesser, according to this shape from line b to line g. Afterwards scratch out the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If you do not close the incision of what it is necessary for you to cut, on account of the discomfort of the weak or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a submersed corrosive ointment, and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then cure it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Of the perforation of the apostema, which happens under the tongue.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These apostemas which happen under the tongue, are of the species of hard Strophulons, which contain cysts, and of them are those which contain humidity.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Which therefore are of those which contain humidities, it is necessary that they be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b to line g, when therefore all that is in the apostema is evacuated of blood, then fill it with old oil, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let the plaster be removed, and let it be cured with an ointment suitable for that, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	Which if the apostema is of the species of nodes of Strophulons, then cut over it, as we have said in the section on Strophulons equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however the wound extends in this so that it emits pus, then administer to it a cauterization, according to what we have said in what has been previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Of the cutting of the apostema which happens on account of the Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the Artery is broken and the skin which is above it becomes consolidated, then often an apostema happens from this: and similarly it happens to the Veins also, so that an apostema and inflammation happen in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is recognized that an apostema and inflammation are on account of the Artery and Vein, are: because, when an apostema is on account of an artery, it is long, gathered in the depth of the body: and when you press the apostema with your fingers, you feel as if there is a hissing.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is on account of the Vein, is round in the obvious body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the cutting above this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and the groins, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is a great fault.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is necessary therefore that his treatment be managed with iron, and that which is also among them, whether it be in the extremities or in the head, it is necessary that it be managed.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Above that therefore which of them is from the inflation of the orifice of the Artery, make an incision in the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with forceps, afterwards the Artery: and free it from its coats, until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert under it a needle, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the Artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place, which is between the two ligaments with a spatula, until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment that generates pus, until the ligaments fall away: afterwards treat it with ointments suitable to it, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	What if the abscess is on account of a cut of the Vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what you can from the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the needle under the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be in it double thread, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the abscess with a good ligament: according to what I said to you about the ligament of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you wish to extract the thread, then insert another needle with a different thread under the whole staple at the site of the incision of the instrument: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the staple in the middle of itself, until when what is in it comes out: then cut the excess skin, and release what has been tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on it a poultice which you have submerged in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment, which is made with bandages and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the staple that happens from a twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as a staple occurs in the artery and vein, similarly a staple occurs in the nerves: which occurs from a blow or occurs from excessive labor and similar things: and it happens most often to those in the places of the joints, or heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a grave staple.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is pressed with force, one feels in it a weakness similar to numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a staple collected in the depth of the body, but rather it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and it does not proceed to the front, nor forward, nor backward to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	What therefore is in the joints, does not need to be entered with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps a contraction occurs.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that which of them is on the head, or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small staple, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and excavate it: then remove it, and close the wound with a suture: and treat it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the cutting of an apostema that happens in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	It happens to certain men many times in their bellies and in the rest of their bodies, thelils, which are called Fungalias, because of their resemblance to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Of which the root is subtle and their head is thick and their lips are inverted.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there is one of them that is small, and there is one of them that is greatly enlarged.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have indeed already seen a man, and in his belly there were two thelils, which were more similar to mushrooms than the others: there was no difference between them, they were white, of small root, and their lips were inverted, and they ended, and moisture flowed from them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I cut them therefore, and I found one to weigh about 8 and a half ounces and the other about 6 ounces. And the operation in cutting them is, that you consider then, if it is weak, humid, and the color of the thelil is white, humid, with subtle root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and let cauteria be present to you on the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled during the cutting of it: prepare therefore if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Which if you see it weak, pale and timid from the cutting with iron, then take a thread made from lead and bind with it the athelul: whose method is what we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then put on the stricture of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not therefore cease to bind with lead, as many times as it impresses on the thelil, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without labor.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the thelil is thick of root, then in the cutting of it there is something to be feared and dreaded: especially what is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	It is possible to cut through the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware that you do not cut into the black bile which is of a foul color, of little sensation, and of a foul appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess: and I come with a warning and a reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of the elevation of the navel.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The elevation of the navel occurs from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from a tear of the diaphragm, which is above the stomach: and there comes out of it either gut or intestine, depending on what happens in the remainder of the rupture.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been previously stated.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from flatulence constricted within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is on account of a tear of the diaphragm, and an issue of the gut: then it is a color similar to that of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and appears in different situations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is on account of the protrusion of the intestine, then its situation is with what we have narrated, of a more vehement diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a gurgling sound: and it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bath, and vehement labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If however it is on account of humidity, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor does it constrict, nor is it added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	For if it is on account of blood, then with these signs appears an abscess turning to blackness from the tumor.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is on account of flesh that has grown: then it is a serious abscess, thick, hard, and it is fixed according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If the swelling is due to excess flesh, then the touch of it is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation regarding it is that you should consider then if the prominence of the navel is due to blood of the artery or vein or excess flesh, then it is necessary that you should abstain from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and dread in it, as I have taught you in the chapter, in which I said that apostema occurs due to the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	What if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or hernia: then it is necessary that you should instruct the weak person, so that he may hold his breath, and stand standing upright.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with a branding iron around the entire navel area.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards instruct him to breathe again between your hands over his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then apply a bandage around the navel area over the place that you marked with the branding iron.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards extend the middle of the apostema upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it around strongly with a thread or with a cord of firm silk binding, and let the knot of the binding be secure.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the extended apostema above the bandage.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find that it has already been caught by the bandage: then pull out the secured one, and insert the index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen: and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut away its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If on the other hand the artery or vein is opposite to you: then surround it abundantly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert two strong threads into them: and insert the two needles around the area that you made around the apostema in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the aposteme in four places above the needle, and if it is useful, remove the needle and leave the place until the rotten flesh falls off by itself, or cut it when it becomes subtle and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is suitable from ointments, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	What if the elevation of the navel is from the thick flesh in it, or from moisture: then it is suitable to concave the aposteme, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what consolidates the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	On the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of cancer, and how it is the way to cure it with medicines: and to beware of it with the cure of it with iron, so that it does not become ulcerated: and we have spoken of cancer generated in the matrix, and caution in its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that whenever cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer which is in the breasts or in the hip, and similar members located for extraction of all of it, especially when it is beginning and small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When however it becomes old and is large, it is not suitable to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself was not able to heal any of them: nor have I seen anyone before me who has approached that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to precede and dissolve the weakness with black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomize it if you find it with a manifest fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weakness for preparation, in which it will be treated with operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then apply to the cancer ointments that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterward press it from every part with the skin, according to the scrutation, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but express the place, and wipe away all gross blood with your hand, or with any instrument that is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if a profuse flow of blood is contrary to you from the incision of an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remainder of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have now explained in the division of the species of Dropsy, and how the collection of water is made: and the signs of each species, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron, is not but the species of ascites alone: and it does not approach with iron the species of tympanitis: nor the species of hyposarca inwardly: for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of Dropsy, tympanitis, with medicines, and your medication has not been effective: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if debility has already befallen the weak person, or if there is another infirmity with it besides Dropsy: such as if there is with it a cough, or a loosening of the stomach, and things similar to these: then beware that you do not treat him with iron: for that is to be feared.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see the weak person of overflowing strength, and there is no sickness with it besides Dropsy alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation on him is, that you should lift up the weak person standing between your hands, and your assistant behind him presses out his stomach with his hand, forcing water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spiney spongy bone, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It has two sharp parts, is long, with a pointed extremity like the Spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	But in it let there be something of shortness little by little, so that you do not transpierce with it during the operation to the intestine, and wound it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of dropsy from the side of the intestines, then it is necessary that you should lengthen with the section from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, downwards directly above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of dropsy is because of liver sickness, then let your section be on the left from the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is because of the spleen, then let the section be on the right side: and it is not necessary also that the section be on the side above which the sick person wants to lie, so that the superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that section, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and rub, as if you are scraping it out: and let the quantity which is scraped out be the quantity of a nail, or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then scrape through, until the spatula reaches the empty place: and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the hole an instrument, whose form is this.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made from silver, or copper, or gold, clean and polished: which has a small hole in its lower part, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side and one on the other side: and its end is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: on its upper end is a handle.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument penetrates the water, then it itself descends immediately on the instrument, and thus evacuates from the water at once half the quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Since if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, then perhaps the weak person dies at once through resolution of his animal spirit: or a fainting fit that approaches death befalls him.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the weak person signify to you from the virtue of his pulse, and from his goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is, that it is retained at once on account of the skin which retains the opening that is above the sifac: about which I have spoken, that you should perforate it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the second day, if you see the weak person tolerate it: and withdraw also from the water a small quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there does not remain from the water except a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If you are afraid for the weak person, and you leave a large amount from the water: then treat it with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in bath and sun, and await its thirst: and treat it with medicines evacuative, until it is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after extraction of the water: according to what I have spoken in that which preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary places not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 45.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant goes out from the womb of its mother, and the head of its bladder is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary therefore to help with the perforation of it at once when it is born with a very sharp and fine spatula, according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put in the hole a thin nail made of lead, and tie it: and leave it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When the skin is raised to pass urine, it should be removed, and wiped.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in the lead, it is possible that the urine which enters on the place, will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He whose hole is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those however in whom the hole is not in its proper place, are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because among those who are born with it, the hole is at the end of the virga: wherefore she cannot urinate to the front, unless she lifts the virga with her hand upwards.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation for her, because the sperm cannot pass to the womb according to the right direction: and it is a foul and grievous disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation for that is, that the weak one is placed on her back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of her virga with your left hand with vigorous extension, and cut the head of the head from the place of the priapus, with a needle, or a sharp spatula: as is the incision of a reed, or as you peel something, so that the middle of it comes to resemble the head of the virga: and so that the hole falls in the middle according to what is proper.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware for yourself during the operation of a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For that thing has happened many times.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Apply to it therefore that which stops the blood, and cure the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	On the matters concerning Albucasis which occur on the foreskin and head of the virga, and the corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 6
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These things often happen to the albather on a branch, and it is an eminence of rotten flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And some of them are malignant, and some of them are not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	You should therefore suspend the non-malignant one with a subtle hook, and cut it off, until you cleanse it completely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on it a plaster submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it after that with the dyafrincon ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	Which if the albather is malignant, of foul color, then you should administer to it a cauterization after the incision of it and its rasping.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If the albather is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of the albather is inside the foreskin and part of it outside: then you should remove the albather that is inside first, until when it has consolidated, then treat the one outside: because when you treat them both at the same time, the foreskin does not heal unless it is perforated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now they also occur on the testicles and a blackening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	You should therefore cauterize all that has already turned black, and what will decay or is already decayed.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply on it after that a mixture of honey which has already been mixed with the flour of roasted grains and the crushed herbs of tritorage.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remainder of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If there is a flow of blood, then administer a cauterization with lunar cauterization, according to this method.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cauterization is a remedy for two conditions at the same time, namely for a flow of blood and for an ulcer when it becomes decayed.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	Which if the head of the branch is eaten away and destroyed entirely in one hour: then you should insert into the mouth of the penis a tube made of lead, so that the weakened man urinates on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the skin to the head of the virga, and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose virga is healthy, and it is not necessary to circumcise over it: and when adhesion occurs because of a wound or apostema, it is necessary to cauterize it with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the virga is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	What is difficult to discern with exquisite care, then it is necessary to cauterize something from the head of the virga and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	What is, that the prepuce, when it is subtle, is perhaps perforated on account of its subtlety quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the prepuce and the head of the virga with a subtle linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then let it be treated with styptic wine, until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants, and the cure of errors that occur to them by accident.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds: nevertheless since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we indicate in this operation the better method, and the easier way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: since they do not use it in their laws, and it is not except what we have acquired through experimentation.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	What is, that I have found the greater part of artisans and phlebotomists using purification by circumcision with a razor, and with forceps: and they use a cauterized wound, and a ligature with a thread, and an incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have already tried all these methods, and I did not find a better purification than with forceps and a ligature with a thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Since in cleansing with a lancet, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two tunics: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut and the inner tunic remains: hence it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleansing that is done by the digital method, that is, with a needle, which surgeons use, the cutting of the extremity of the member is not avoided: for perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron comes out and spoils your operation: and the skin of a child is brief by nature, and often they are born in such a way that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen it.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Cleansing with forceps and ligature with a thread has shown me a good experiment: for the forceps are proportional to the incision: therefore, because the sharpness that is above is as the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you press with your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation at one time: and there is made a compression of similar figure, containing the skin of the member from all parts, with which error does not fall in any way.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of operation is its own, that you cause to be extracted, especially a child, if it is one of those who understand for a little while, what you do not do, except that you bind the thread on its member only: and you let it go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be merry in every way that is possible for you, from the fact that he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands prepared in a standing position, and let him not be sitting: and hide the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into its branch and blow on the skin and pull it upwards until the head of the branch comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from the filth that has accumulated in the wound.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards tie below it for a short space a second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger, and thumb, the place of the lower ligature with good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and extract the head of the branch.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better) and put powder on top: and over the powder a cloth in which vitellus of egg has been spread, mixed with good fresh rose oil: and let it remain on until the next day: and treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of a fork is for cleansing purposes this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two extremities be blunt and let them be cutting: so that the branch of the nail does not come out on them: and let the length of the two sharp edges be as the length of the two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The error that occurs in cleansing is: because perhaps it escapes the inner skin entirely, or a part of it at the place of the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you stretch it out with your nail before the marking of the place: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	What if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If however three days have passed and what is under the branch remains inflated, marked: then let it be until the hot apostema has settled, and excise it with ease, and cut it according to that which is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the branch.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Treatment is therefore with that which consolidates the wound from powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders: and if it cuts into the skin above the measure, and it goes to the upper parts, it will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Treatment is therefore with that which we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of retained urine from the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction made from stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh that has grown, and similar things to these which we have spoken of as methods of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is on account of a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that he should be made to bend over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him stretch out his belly from the upper part of his back, and let him tightly constrict his breathing as much as is possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	The neck of the bladder is thus compressed towards the expulsion of the stone to the back, whereupon the urine is discharged.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	What if it is not solved with what we have said, and the thing is vehement upon the patient: then it is necessary that you administer the extraction of it with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: let it be of silver, and let it be subtle, thin, concave like the quill of a feather in subtlety of a radius, long in likeness to one and a half palms: to which let there be a subtle pipe at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of the exit of urine through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie at its end a wool or a cord, with a good ligature: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with forceps if anything overflows from the wool, truly introduce into the pipe with vehemence, like an Alzer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the siringa with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg: and make the weak sit upon a seat, and embrocate the vessel, and its own virga with humid oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the siringa into the virga with ease, until it reaches the root of the virga.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then fold it over double from the part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the siringa into it, until it reaches the bladder, and the weak person feels that it has already reached the empty space: and this is not done according to this order, unless the passage, in which it goes, is where there is a tortuosity.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with a wool slowly.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the catheter will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and make the catheter run through the urine passage: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do that, until the bladder is emptied, and the weak person finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of cleansing the bladder with a Clyster.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there happens to be an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is confined in it, and one wishes to distill waters and medicines into it: then let it be done with the instrument that is called a Clyster, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is stopped, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three holes, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is that which pushes, should be according to the quantity that fills it without addition, until when it is pulled with it, something is attracted from the humidities: and when it is pushed, it expels far away: according to what makes the clyster, with which naphtha is projected, that is, Greek fire in the workshops of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When I insert the instrument to project moisture into the bladder, I introduce the extremity of the catheter into the moisture, and pull with it that which pushes upwards, for the moisture is pulled into the concavity of the catheter.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then I introduce its extremity into the rod, according to that which we described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then I push the moisture with that which pushes it, for the moisture immediately reaches the bladder, so that the weak person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The shape of a thin enema instrument by which the bladder is enemad.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made from silver or gold: whose head is higher and similar to a small hook, and under that a hollow where the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a goat, and put in it moisture, with which instrument you will enema the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two hollows with a strong ligature and double thread: and warm that moisture a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the extremity of the enema instrument into the rod, afterwards tighten your hand over the bladder with the moisture with a suitable pressure, until the weak person feels that the moisture has now reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however the bladder is not present to you, then take a piece of parchment, and make from it a circle, and pierce it throughout its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as the nest is gathered: afterwards you put in it that which you use from moistures, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it in the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken about the division of the species of Stone, and its cure with medicines, and I have said the difference between the Stone generated in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs of all that: and I have said the Stone in which the operation falls with the hand and incision: and there is a Stone generated in the bladder specifically: and that which is fixed on the staff: and I am narrating that with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that the Stone generated in the bladder, happens most often to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And one of its signs is that urine comes out from the bladder similar to water in its thinness: and appears in it white sand, and the weak man rubs his staff, and labors with it, and many times it hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is erected, and goes out with that, the bottom, in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure of children is easy, as long as they are up to fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In youths, however, it is moderate, in that which is between them: and of whom the Stone is larger, the cure is easier: and if small, the care is the opposite.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we arrive at the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the weak person with a clyster, which will extract all the dung that is in his intestines: for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the Stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the weak person be taken by the feet, and shaken, and moved to the lower parts: so that the Stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or jumps from a high place many times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit prepared between your hands, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the whole bladder is inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and feel him from the outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then apply the proper thing at once with incision upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	What if it does not fall under your touch altogether, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand, if he is a weak boy: or the middle finger if he is a young man complete: and insert it into his anus, and feel for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it little by little to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and push it to the exterior against the place of which you wish to make an incision: and instruct one assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and his other hand, that he may remove the skin which is under the testicles on the part away from the place in which the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert a spatula or knife with an incision, the shape of which is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And cut in that which is between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the exterior incision be ample, and the interior be strict, according to the quantity that it is possible for the exit of the stone from it not being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger which is in the anus presses the stone near the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that because of the stone, in which there are angles and edges, its exit is made difficult on account of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from this it is smooth, like a gland, and round: and its exit is made easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore for those which have angles and edges, add to the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	What if it does not come out thus, then it is necessary that you apply above it: or tie above it with a device of the center, whose extremity is like a crescent moon, which ties above the stone and does not depart from it: or that you insert under it an instrument subtle, of curved extremity.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot exceed it, then enlarge the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	What if something of blood conquers you, cut it off with a razor.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there is a stone more than one, then first push the large one to the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards push a small one after that, and do similarly if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	What if the valve is very large, then it is ignorance to cut above it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it happens to the weak one of two things, either that he dies, or that there is a continual dripping of urine: therefore, because the place is not consolidated at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Indeed administer the expulsion of it, until it goes out: or instruments on the fracture with forceps, until you extract it bit by bit.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with turpentine, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and put on it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot aposteme may be seated.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then let the weak one rest on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you then loosen it, moisten the place with water, and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment diaphenicum, and the ointment baselicum, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however there occurs in the wound a hot and corrosive aposteme, and similar things: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prohibited from it: and that is recognized by the emission of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and apply all the species with what is suitable from the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the hours of treatment that you bind two hips, and gather, the causes of medicines which are placed on the spot.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	What if the stone is small, and it is in the flesh of the virgin, and it is fixed in it, and the urine exit is blocked: then treat it with what I will narrate before you proceed to the cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times indeed you will be exempt from cutting by this treatment, for I have already tested that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And there is, that you should take a perforator made of iron, whose form this is, triangular at the end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and bind with it the branch under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the iron perforator into the branch with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand on the stone little by little: and complete the perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For urine will be relieved immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the branch.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it itself breaks, and goes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If however this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prohibits it: then bind a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the same branch between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards loosen the binding, and cleanse the congealed blood which forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone, unless so that it does not return to the bladder: and another tie above, unless when the thread is released after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you, when you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upwards, so that it returns according to your complement, and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Of the extraction of a stone from women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If however it happens to any of them a stone, then the treatment is difficult, and it is prohibited because of many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or one of those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, that you do not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the remoteness of the place of the stone: where it requires a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	What if necessity provokes to that, then it is necessary that you accept a woman physician, well knowing: and she is rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you are deprived of them, then seek a chaste physician, subtle, and present a midwife well taught in the matter of women, or a woman who has begun to learn part of the art: make her therefore present, and command her, that she do all that you command her from the inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	At first what is, to examine if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If then he finds it, he constricts it under his finger, and then orders the midwife to insert her finger into the weak woman's vulva, and feels above the stone, after which she places her left hand on the bladder, and presses it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If then he finds the stone, then it is necessary that he moves it gradually from the orifice of the bladder to the lower areas with the greatest strength of his, until he reaches with it to the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he cuts above it at the opposite of the middle of the vulva at the root of the hip, from whichever side he prepares for it, and feels the stone on that side: and his finger is not removed from the stone, constricting under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he inserts the razor above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If then he feels the stone, then he adds to the incision a second cut proportional in quantity to what of the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among them is the small and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long and the round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its species, so that it may be indicated to you by this above what you are using.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If then the blood overcomes you, then apply to the place a poultice of toasted and ground, and hold it for one hour, until the bleeding stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone emerges: and do, so that you prepare with you from the instruments, which I mentioned in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may help yourself by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	For if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which was cut: then put powder on the place, and constrict it with decent stricturing bandages: and do not move it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	A weak woman will perhaps die from it.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood is satiated after some days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On the cutting of a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery collection is not a true hernia, unless it be an aggregation of humidity in the white vascular covering that is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is named a vascular covering.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own proper membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it becomes putrid: which is another egg, and is a skin of the testicle between the white vascular covering that we spoke of: and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this watery collection is from a weakness that happens to the testicles: for which reason this material flows out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this humidity has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For it is either of a yellowish color, or it is a bloody red, or feculent, black, or it is a watery white, and this is the one that is most.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white vascular covering that we spoke of, then the swelling is round in length for a while just like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the humidity contains it on every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if it is humidity in its own proper membrane, then the swelling is round with a part of the egg, and because of this a man thinks that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white vascular covering, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When I apply my knowledge of the colour of humidity, then I test the colour of humidity in the apostema with the square introversion, whose shape precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that which appears in the trace of the Introversion, I judge from that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we proceed to a cure with iron, then it is necessary to prescribe to the weak, that they should be bled if possible for them, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should be placed on his back on something high and a little elevated, and many cloths should be put under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right side, who should stretch out his arm to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the region of the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle along the length, up to near the breast; and let the incision be according to the rectitude of the equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white substance that comprehends; and cut out this and observe, or take care lest you cut from hence, that you cut it; and your cutting should be where it is suspended with the egg more: and subtly examine with the cutting according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the full watery substance with a wide piercing, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with forceps, and stretch the watery substance upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles that comprehends; and cut the watery substance as much as it is possible for you to cut it, or with its entirety, or in a piece, especially the broad subtle part.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully and thoroughly examine in the incision, there will be no security, lest the water flow back.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If however the egg proceeds outward from its skin during the time of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the womb, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then cure it as the remaining wounds, until it is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	What if you find the egg corrupted by blackness of another kind, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels, which are the suspensors, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspensor, and extract the egg: afterwards cure it with what we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water is collected in the two parts, then know that there are two pipes: therefore cut the other part equally according to what you have done in the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, that there be one operation, then do it: afterwards wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions a thread soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and put on the dressing a thread which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the navel: and put above double cloths, and they are poultices: and tie them above with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then let two cloths be taken, and they be sewn, and filled with medicated thread, according to this likeness: and let the extremities be made which are pressed from a cot, or a wet thread: and let them be tied with a bandage in the groin of the arms: and one extremity let it reach above the thigh up to the back, and the second let it reach to the part of the breast: and two extremities above the two hips below, and two other extremities above the two groins, and all the bandage be tied in the groin of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when this ramex is treated artificially with a cautery at the place of the section with iron; and it is, that you take a sharp cautery knife, and cut the skin of the testicles; and it is ignited, according to what we have narrated: until when there appears a white scab containing water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are absorbed.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then puncture that scab with it, and it is ignited, until all moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch the scab with forceps, and scrape it with a sharp ignited cautery, and cut it according to what is possible for you, until you eradicate the whole of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and less inclined to a flow of blood, and better than the operation with a section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If indeed an adverse condition makes itself known to you at the time of the section, or at the time of the cautery, whether it be a hot aposteme, or a flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary that you treat that which makes the adverse condition known to you from that with a cure which is suitable for it, according to what has been previously stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If however he is weak and timid, and does not look forward to this operation, because of its horror: then administer the puncture according to what I have narrated it to be.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is confirmed to you by that which we have spoken of concerning the signs, that the ramex is watery: then it is necessary that you make the weak person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then puncture the aposteme in its lower part with a broad spatula: and put the puncture according to the length of the body, and let it be wide open, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put a dressing on the place of the cut, and bind it, and let it stay so that the remainder of the water runs out: then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however the blockage is an obstacle to the exit of water at the time when you perforate it: and it is not except on account of that, because the white membrane makes a blockage in the opening of the wound, and prohibits the exit of water: then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which water of dropsy is extracted, whose form has preceded: or add for a short time in the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you should know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or around that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it accumulates, then it should be tapped according to the same method, and the weak days will pass.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of a fleshy ulcer.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that in the incision above this ulcer, there is a fear of inducing destruction in many conditions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Wherefore it seems to me that its neglect is beneficial for its healing.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I recall the operation on it, and the appearance of an apostema.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore, that many gatherings occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and this happens for many reasons.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an excess of sharp or acidic humor, which flows to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the gathering is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious gathering.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone-like gathering, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the knotting of the arteries, and their swelling: as I have already mentioned before: or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is therefore from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the condition of the gathering, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not proper to touch it directly.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is made from the inflation of veins is not dispersed from it by compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section on this species is made and on the rest of the flesh and it is as one cuts the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with the white siftach: and free the suspensor from the vessels, and tie up the vessels: and cut the suspensor after you have freed it from every part of the parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is proper that you should pull the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if an adhesion is between any of the siphacet or in that which is between the vessels: then it is proper that you free the whole of that adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however there is a nativity of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is proper that you cut the whole of it, and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine: afterwards cure it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the treatment of Varices, which is with Veins.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Uitis is an unresolved aposteme, which occurs with a certain wrapping, similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles: and it makes difficult movement and exercise on the infirm, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this sickness is fear, because of that which has preceded it, the memory remains.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	It is true that we should say the operation on it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is proper to make the infirm person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then strike the suspension of the testicles to the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the instruments that are nearest to the rod: and let another servant hold them, and let him stretch them with a vigorous stretching.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad sharp spatula a transverse section in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scratch away from every part, as we have told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards fix in them a needle in which is a double thread, and tie it in the first places to which the ties occur: and tie it again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut it in a straight section according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from foul corrupted humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which it is customary to generate a sanative, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not an evil through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If however the vessel occurs to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles with the vessels be extracted for this: so that the ovum is not deprived of nourishment, on account of the incision, and wither, or dry up, and is not a help with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Of the treatment of Intestinal hernias.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The coming out of this hernia is from a section, which occurs in the siphac extended above the navel on the groin side from the middle of the navel.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why the intestines come down from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the siphac or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy thing, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign is when it is from the extension of the wrist.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal in depth to the intestine: therefore, because the wrist compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign is when it is from a section of the wrist, because it causes sudden violent pain from the beginning: and it is a diverse abscess appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the outside of the wrist.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it comes out with the intestine a hernia: and this is called intestinal Ramex and hernia: and sometimes it happens with bloating.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces runs into the intestine and is retained there: and it is with that a danger of weakness: because it causes severe pain, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the cure of this kind of illness with iron there is fear: for which it is necessary to beware of the case in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of the operation is, that you should order the weak person, to reduce the intestine with his hand to the interior of its own concavity, if it has fallen back.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he should be lifted up onto his neck between your hands: and lift up his thighs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and cut the skin of the testicles along its entire length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix on both lips of the incision hooks, according to which you will indicate for opening the incision with them: and let the incision be according to the quantity that is possible, so that the egg can come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scratch the wrist, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white wrist is detected, hard on every side: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white wrist, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the wrist according to, and release with it the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the interior of the cut of the testicles: and with this extend the white sifach upwards, with your left hand: and lift the mouth with the sifach to the place of the incision: and instruct the assistant, that he should extend the mouth upwards: and you loosen the adhesion, which is behind the completed solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers, that there should not be anything there from the intestine entwined in the white and hard sifach.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If you find something of it: then push it to the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made a ligature from ten threads: and introduce it at the end of the sifach, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles that follows the incision: then cut the ends that project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over others with a figure that is in the form of a cross: and tie with them the sifach, of which we spoke, which is under the skin of the testicles with a vehement ligature, until it cannot allow any of the vessels, which nourish them to send to them anything: so that there does not occur from it a hot apostema.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put again a second ligature outside the first ligature, a distance of less than two fingers from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, let out from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity of the size of a finger: and cut the rest entirely according to its roundness, and remove the mouth from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles at the incision, from which runs blood and serum: as we have narrated in what was previously said.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer a wool submerged in oil, and put it on the wound: and administer the ligature that we have narrated.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white vitriarized sifach which we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligament, until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If its fall is delayed, then let it be bathed with warm water: and put on top of it what we mentioned, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the remainder of the treatment of wounds, until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning the Vein that has a wart.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	On this vein I have not seen anyone who dared to perform its cure with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones said that it should be done as we narrated concerning the vein which is with the Vitae.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is to bind the vessels after the section above it with facility below: then cut in the middle, and treat afterwards with what opens it, until the vessels fall: and treat the wound, according to what we said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the rupture that occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is little, and returns every hour: but truly if the time with this condition is prolonged, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the sifach which is in the groins, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the sifach extends: then becomes soft, and the place becomes calloused, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cauterization, as was previously explained.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this manner: and it is that the weak person lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the place of the rupture and the prominent part, a cross-section in width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then stretch the Alsifak and what is under the skin until when it is detected the white Sifach which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a rasp and put it on the prominent place of the Sifach and press it to the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew two prominent places on the extremity of the rasp from the Sifach and join one of them with the other: then extract the extremity of the rasp.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the Alsifak at all, nor stretch the groin, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal rupture.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you cut the threads, clean it and restore the wound, until it becomes consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the Sifach is contracted, and prominence of the rupture is not added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better in this place: since it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles often becomes softened in certain men, because of which the flesh that is between them becomes softened and its appearance becomes foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to cure it, to make the weak one lie on his back, and to cut the entire skin that has been softened above the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture: and if necessary, first remove the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is forbidden by our law, and because of that it would be permissible for me not to mention it in my book, and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it be in the science of medicine when he is questioned about it, and so that he knows the cure for one to whom it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other method is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our utility through them, such as mules, boars, and cats, and similar ones among animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by extraction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by splitting and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by extraction, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water, until its testicles soften and relax, and hang down: then we extract them with our hand, until they dissolve and do not appear to the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by splitting and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the spermatic cord, and cut above all one ovum with a single section, until when two ovum proceed: then cut what is after you have excised both, and do not leave on them any of the sifaket except subtle sifac, which is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by extraction: because extraction perhaps leaves something of the testicles, for which reason the animal desires coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the treatment of the hermaphrodite of two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodite from urine is a second two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	A wound of theirs is, which appears in what follows the space, or on the skin of the testicles, in what is between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine runs from what is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women however is one species, and is the woman's vulva above the pubes as the testicles of a small man entirely, protruding to the outside: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three species, two from men, and one species from women, is: that it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the cure of remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine exits, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the cutting of the tent-like thing, and the flesh that protrudes in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The prepuce perhaps is added over the natural thing, until it becomes foul and its appearance is ugly: and sometimes it becomes magnified in some women to such a degree, that it expands like in men, and reaches up to the coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore to hold the excess of the prepuce with the hand, or with a hook, and cut it: and do not go too deep in the cutting, especially at the root, so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The flesh that arises is the flesh that is born in the opening of the womb, until it fills it: and perhaps it protrudes to the outside like a tail: and because of this some of the first call the disease "caudate".
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that we incise it as we incise the tentskin and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Of the treatment of Alratica, which is a woman's ulcer not having been perforated.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is, that it is a woman's ulcer not perforated, or is a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from a disease which preceded it: and this itself comes either from flesh born added, or from sifach subtle, or from a spatula: and it comes either in the depth of the matrix, or in its sides, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and prohibits coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prohibits menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And its recognition is made by the appearance of an obstetrician, if the obstruction is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not apparent, then feel for it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the obstruction is from subtle sifach, and it is near to both lips: then touch it and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you put upon the two lips a poultice.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your indexes of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her thighs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the subtle sifach is broken apart, and the obstruction is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a woolen thread, and dip it in oil, and put it on the place: and let the woman apply it every day, so that the place is not consolidated by another thing.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the sifach is thick and dense: then it is necessary to cut it out with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the obstruction is from flesh born, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it: and let there be with you medicines which sedate the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus mixed with the whites of eggs.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide tube made of lead, so that the wound does not heal quickly, and it holds for some days: and administer a bandage made from dry linen, then the rest will be cured by treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there arises in the matrix a nativity of other flesh: it is necessary therefore that they be cut according to this method: for there is not an apostema which is cancerous, for an apostema is cancerous which is in the matrix, nor does it become contrary with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, of Athehelil, and of the redness of the buttocks in women's wounds.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are the openings of the veins, until from them flows much blood continually.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil: and I have already spoken of the division of their species, and their signs: and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the matrix, and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those of them which are in the opening of the matrix, upon which the sensation falls, are those which can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you send the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the hemorrhoids with the forks, or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then sprinkle over them at the flow of blood from one powder of incisions without biting: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and incense, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards put her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	For if the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and crushed pomegranates, and gall, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over its back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore blood is drawn with it, it is good: and if not, make blisters adhere to the back and the breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and soak it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the branches of aulalat, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the aposteme has rested, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The Albarth root is similar to the heads of alhaasse, and its appearance is rough.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said equally in the treatment of ailments: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Of the perforation of the uterus which occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 23.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There occur in the matrix many kinds of apostemes, such as cancer, and the aposteme of stones, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot aposteme.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already spoken of all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of them, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of the hot aposteme which occurs in the matrix, when it is among the apostemes which collect pus, and you should know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the aposteme in its beginning is acute with percussion and inflammation and fever: and you see it to be red: if sense falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps against maturation, until when the acuteness of the accidents has rested.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that has two seats, and she should lean back or lie on her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her abdomen: and her hips should be expanded, and she should put her arms under her thighs, and tie both with a ligature close to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the matrix is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes in those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you administer this instrument, that you fix with the radius the depth of the woman's matrix: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the matrix, and harms the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you put pillows on the surface of the depth of the matrix: so that the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the matrix is prohibited: and it is necessary that the midwife puts a thread which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that she holds the instrument, and that the servant turns the thread, until the depth of the matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by the hand, and is soft and mild: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the sanies are evacuated, then it is necessary that you put on the wound a bandage submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and put on the bandage, and extract the section from the depth of the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put outside on the matrix, and on the pubes clean wool submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and wound are washed, it is cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled: then anoint with ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	What if the wound is hidden within the matrix, then it is necessary to prohibit the cure of it with iron, but rather to cure it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The doctrine of obstetrics, how they medicate living embryos, according to an unnatural birth figure.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the figure of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs of it are, that when you see a woman pressed at the lower parts, and desires to smell the air, and is alleviated above what is above her from the birth, and there is a hastening of the exit of the embryo: then know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and its exit is over its head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press her womb, so that the embryo may come down quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and is cleansed from those superfluities of a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But that which is besides this birth, is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus comes out over its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hands come out: or its belly comes out: and perhaps it is inverted over its neck, and similar things from unpraiseworthy figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary therefore for the obstetrician to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure of them, and how the device is in it, and is signified by that, and is established upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus moves up above its head with its natural exit and presses upon the woman, and parturition becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength is already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her; and fumigate her vulva with a decoction of fenugreek, and with humid oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert her little spatula between her fingers and find the secondine with it and cut it with her nail until what is in it runs out from the humidity; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus comes down.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not come down, then it is necessary that the woman be given a clyster made from fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her after the clyster to be compressed: and make her sneeze with a concoction, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If both hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you push them back with ease, little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not pass into the birth passage, then put the woman on a seat and lift her feet up; then strike the seat against the ground; and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall with the striking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies: then cut them off, and extract the remainder of the fetus; and tie its hand with cloth, and pull it out gently: for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The embryo comes out over its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out over its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus little by little; afterwards pull it out evenly.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and stretch it out little by little.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When the suppurating matter comes out up to the hips, then order him to be compressed and make him sneeze with the confection, for it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have described, then reduce the fomentation little by little, until you put him according to his natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will come out then with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	What if it is prohibited with all that we have described, then take from the mucus of the altea, and the oil of sesame, and the dissolved gum, and strike everything in a mortar with a good stroke, then smear the ulcer of the woman and her lower abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water, until she gets the hypogastric region affected.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that her lower parts are already warmed, then make for her a seat of myrrh and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she has held the seat for one hour, then make her sit on the seat.

Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this form, then insert his hands gradually into the introitus.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman will be raised over her neck, and her feet will hang down to the lower parts, and she herself will sit reclining on a bed, and will clasp her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press above her abdomen gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under her feet from the pubic area, until it is prepared in the lower part.

Then attend to the reduction with his hands, and straighten the fetus according to its natural figure: and make the woman sneeze, and order her to compress herself, until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus emerges over its shoulder, with hands outstretched, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife holds the hand of the fetus, then she should turn it around gently, and straighten it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is straightened, then put on its neck what we have prepared from oil and mucilages.

Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If I suspend it above the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel, so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.

¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins often are born, and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	But truly that is extraordinary, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five is a thing beyond nature, and they do not live fully: and the afterbirth contains them, however many they are, as one secundine: and they are separated by a siphach, distinguishing between them a tied ligament at the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out just as one fetus comes out with a natural and easy delivery, and they come out with an infamous delivery, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	What if some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach that which we spoke of, concerning unnatural positions, then treat them as we have described: and let it be with subtle skill, and do what is done with ease and slowness, and be ingenious according to every figure with what is prepared for him from the guiding ingenuity towards health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has been verified by me, that a woman aborting has expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which was done for the measurement of the glorious wise one.

¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76, Head or Chapter Seventy-Six
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division of medication, and it does not come out, and you need to use an operation with the hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of healthy strength and does not have any of the accidents for which loss is feared over her, then it is necessary that the woman should be placed on a bed, on her back, and her head should be bent downwards, and her thighs lifted up: and a servant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body does not extrude during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then the mouth of the matrix should be moistened with humid oils, with mucus of the altea plant, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucus: then she should insert it into the matrix with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should seek with it the place where the nails are fixed from the fetus, and the places suitable for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend on its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its armpit, or in the places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however it has descended on its feet, then in its breast, and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand, and put its curve in what is between the fingers of the left hand: and insert with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have spoken of, until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he should insert on the opposite side another hook or a third, if necessary, so that the contraction is equal and does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with an equal extension, and the extension is not just according to straightness, but rather it should be moved to every side, so that the exit of it is alleviated, as happens with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is fitting for what is between them, that the extension should be made gentle.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from the side, so that she turns it out with them, what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If a part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks should be moved to another place that is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If then a hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to push it back, because of its constriction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until when the whole comes out, cut it at the joint of the arm, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you do the same with the other hand, and with the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the head of the fetus is large, or there is a constriction at the exit, or there is water collected on its head: then it is necessary that a sharp Spatumile be inserted between the fingers, and that with it the head should be grasped, and the water extracted: or it should be broken with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, he should do if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary that the shoulder be cut: or it should be extracted with a misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	What if the head protrudes and is constricted at the fork then it will be found until the humidity that is in the chest is poured out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it does not become complicated and nor does it press on for the exit: then cut the head bit by bit, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	What if the lower part of the belly is an accumulation or there is dropsy in it: then it is necessary that you perforate it, until humidity runs out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the matrix is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is constricted at the belly or chest: then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped over your hand: and find the belly or chest, until what is in them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however the remaining limbs are delivered and the head returns: then the Midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If indeed the mouth of the matrix is open, then she should insert her hand into the depth of the matrix, and seek with it the head, and draw it with her fingers to the mouth of the matrix: then she should insert in it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	What if the mouth of the matrix is constricted, on account of the hot apostema which has happened to it: then it is not necessary that she should labor over it, but rather it is necessary to administer an effusion of humid things, and ointments: and administer plasters: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	What if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it will come out evenly: then administer what we have said regarding a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	What if it is not possible, then cut bit by bit, and extract.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said regarding hot apostumes which occur in the matrices.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	What if there occurs a flow of blood, then let it be stopped with astringent waters, and administer the remainder of the cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have indeed already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was, then she became pregnant on top of it with another, afterwards the other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, a postule occurred to her after a long time on her navel, and it became inflated, until it was opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called therefore to her cure, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound was not consolidated.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I put therefore on it certain strong attractant plasters: and the bone came out from its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed for her, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was astonished therefore at that, since there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought therefore, that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I examined the wound, and I extracted many bones, with the woman being in her best condition: and she lived for a long time afterwards, and a small amount of pus came out from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not confirm this extraordinary thing, except that there is science and assistance in it, for what the medical artisan administers with his hand from the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of necessary instruments for extracting the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 78.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	This figure below is the form of a Strictor, which has equal books, and on which are two equal vertiges at the extremities of two wooden pieces.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	Truly this Vertige ought to be finer than the Strictor, and that it should be made either from ebony or boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	The width of each piece of wood is about two fingers, and the thickness of each one is about one finger, and the length of each one is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two additions made from the same type of wood, which have already been fixed to both, whose length is more than half a palm, and the width of each one is about two fingers or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two vertigines.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the Vertiginis by which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from ebony wood or boxwood, according to the likeness of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, on the extremity of it there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a palm, and the width of each one is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you want to open the matrix with it, then make a woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging, what is between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two joined additions into the matrix, and you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you want from the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of another Vertiginis which the ancients called the shape of the Impeller by which the fetus is pushed out.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The shape of the Almisdac, with which the large head is pressed, and it is similar to the forceps, which has teeth at the extremity, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made with a wrapping, like forceps according to this shape, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it cuts and presses.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The shape of Almisdac with which the small head is bound.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The shape of a bandage having one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The shape of a bandage having two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The shape of a forceps with which there are serrated teeth, with which the head of a fetus is bound.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of scissors having two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of two broad scissors.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are exercised, and the more their kinds are multiplied, and the more they are prepared by the artisan, the swifter he is at his operation, and the higher he is among men, on account of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not therefore despise any of them, so that it may be prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	Their necessity is indeed inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the extraction of the afterbirth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the afterbirth is retained with the part, then it is necessary that you should order the weak one to retain its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a condiment: and bind your hand over her mouth, and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it then comes out by this means, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and pierce in the cover a hole: and put in it expelling herbs of the matrix, such as calamint, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and sesame, and lignous cassia, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a bundle of reeds over the hole of the cover of the pot, and another extremity into the mouth of the matrix: and let her hold it until the vapour penetrates to the concavity of the matrix.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the second one will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the Midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or flaxseed oil.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then let her insert into the womb, and search for it with that the second one.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she has found it, then let her take it, and pull it out little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it is attached deep in the womb, then let her insert her hand, according to what we have described, until when she finds the second one, and pulls it out little by little according to what is proper, so that the womb does not fall during violent pulling: indeed it is necessary, that it be turned with ease to the right and left sides: then let there be added to the amount of the pulling.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It itself will cut then, and will be separated, and will come out from the adhering.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	Which if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and from a medication of an ointment with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If however it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware that you do not fatigue yourself over it in repeated attempts at extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is necessary indeed, that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, be tied to the thigh of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then anoint her with the ointment called tetrapharmacon.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will putrefy it after some days, and dissolve it, and bring it out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Truly however when it putrefies, a bad smell rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak woman.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary therefore that fumigations suitable for it be administered.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Certain of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and fig and sycamore.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of an instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of the secundina and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let a bowl be made similar to an alcama or from clay: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be put on the coals: let her hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and let another be repeated.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the cure of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many of the boys are born, and their anus is not perforated, whom a subtle fistula has already closed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary therefore, that the midwife should perforate that fistula with her finger: and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp spatula: and let her beware of the arm, lest she touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put on top of it a woolen cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it will close, then put a lead pipe in the opening for many days, and let it be removed when the boy wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now the closure of the anus has also occurred from the consolidation of a wound or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that the consolidation be cut, then cured with what we have said about the cure and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the cure of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas that occur in the lower parts are a knot and a thickness that occur near the anus of the fundament or in the space of one of the parts: and it is one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that knot becomes old, it opens, and a watery white humidity or subtle pus runs out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when there are some of these fistulas that penetrate.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are recognized by that which comes out of the evacuation and by the flatulence when the weak one uses the evacuation and perhaps comes out of the worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are among them fistulas when they are in a space penetrating up to the bladder and up to the passage of the virga.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are among them penetrating ones up to the joint of the hip and up to the knot of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that by which the penetrating fistula is recognized up to the anus, also from the non-penetrating one, it is that you insert your index finger into the anus and you insert a subtle probe made of brass or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuousness.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	That if there is tortuousness in it, then insert into it a subtle probe made of lead or a hair from the hairs of horses, until you feel the probe or the hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	That if you do not feel it deeply, nor does anything come out of the opening from the evacuation, nor flatulence, nor worms as I have said, then know that it is a non-penetrating one: proceed therefore to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or to the passage of urine, then its signification is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition from this that the place be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it is penetrating up to the joint of the hip or to the socket of the hip, then its sign is that the probe penetrates up to that place, if there is no tortuousness up to the mouth: and the finding of pain in the surrounding area of the part, and that pus always comes out of it: and that medication is not effective in it, nor is it consolidated with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and the treatment of them is labor and vanity to him, from foolish medicines, on which a form is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that which is not penetrating and not chronic, healing is expected with a plaster: according to what I tell you, and I have already proven: and it is, so that the weak person lies on their back under your hands: and lift their legs up above their hips, and their hips are inclined towards their belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then a probe of lead or copper is inserted, if there is a tortuousness in the fistula, until you know where the probe passes through.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If the weak person feels it around their anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel on your finger that the probe has already penetrated through and detected, besides what you feel between your finger and the siphac or flesh: then you certainly know that it is penetrating: do not therefore labor in it, since its healing is not, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They have said, however, that a callus is healed in certain men and from the medication which they hope for a remedy, it is to apply a subtle cauterium of ignes according to the width of the fistula, as previously described, and insert the ignited thing into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that two or three times, until you know that all those added fleshy growths which are similar to the filter of a bird's pen have already been seared.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with linen wraps in butter, until the seared growths come out: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it is not healed with any other cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe comes out and does not reach to your finger which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh or siphac: and you see the fistula in what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will dissect with the probe that is in the fistula, until the dissection reaches where the probe's extremity reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh parts that resemble the tubes of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if the blood overcomes you, and it separates between you and your operation so that it cuts off those flesh parts: then what is done is better and for a speedier healing, to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cauterization with fire brings together good habits, an attachment of those flesh parts, and a cutting off of blood, and a drying of humidities.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with bandages wrapped in butter, or pounded grasses, until the place emits pus, and those attached flesh parts go out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, that generate hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there are astringents and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then already it is healed: and do not repeat the treatment.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already penetrated to the depth of the anus, and is prolonged from the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and examine with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a thinness, and between you and it there is a covering of sifac or flesh, and it is near to the penetration: then there is no operation on that, except according to the way of confidence and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is, that one of the three methods is administered in it: either you cauterize it, as we have said: or you cut it, until you obtain its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert bandages, and a cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed far with the cutting, so that you do not injure the continence of the anus, and it happens over the weak point of the exit of the bowel without control.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	For a strong [wound] will be healed: either you will lengthen the dressing or clean it after you cut it close to the bone, as we have said, or with a probe, or with another instrument of a sharp extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filtered flesh parts which are in the cut, as far as you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then consider the restoration of the whole wound with the cut, and the upper orifice where it consolidates: and a remaining open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter above the weaker.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when a fistula is suited in this manner: and it is, when you insert the probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus: then take the probe of perforated extremity, which is like a needle, that is, preparing the skins, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wrapped from five threads, and tie around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it is penetrating on the edge of the anus internally near, then extract the thread from that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring together the two ends: and tie both, and leave it for one day, or two days: and as much as the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it well, until those fleshes which are between the two ends of the thread are cut, and fall: then cure the wound, until it consolidates, and is healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate by whatever method is prepared for you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you must not make it because of the lacertum, so that you do not cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the spoon for a patient with a fistula is pointed at one end and not pointed at the other, so that it does not cut what is not necessary.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows after the cutting of them, and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are two kinds of hemorrhoids.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are inside the anus, like vessels containing blood, or they are like a mass of grapes.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And among them there are small ones and large ones: and blood always flows from them, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But truly those that are outside the anus are for the most part small in humidity, from which flows a watery discharge or a little blood with constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of the one that is inside the anus, is to prescribe a poultice to sit on: and it is squeezed, until the anus comes out, and the fibers appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore suspend them with hooks: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they are not retained by the hooks, on account of their humidity and softness, then take them with a coarse cloth, or with a cloth dipped in woolen felt, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and powder over them after the cutting certain hot powders, so that they may serve in place of a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was previously said in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	What if the anus does not obey evacuation, then introduce a weak enema in which is a small mordication, so that it loosens what is in the anus and it obeys evacuation quickly when the weak one evacuates.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their treatment is easy and simple: and it is that you catch them with your finger, or you catch them with a hook, and you cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And he who is averse to cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take an unwound thread, and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw out the hemorrhoid upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and wind the two ends of the thread on the lower part of the needle, and let them be crosswise: and constrict the hemorrhoid with a strong ligature.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and withdraw the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and let one of them be discharged: nor press itself, so that it runs out from it an excess of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or cerate, and put it on the anus: and order the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it alone, until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments, and the remainder of the treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For many times it happens from dryness of the feces, and from constriction of the nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become old, and medicine does not penetrate into them: then it is necessary to scrape with the points of a spatula, or with your finger, until they become humid, and the outer skin which prevents them from consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them, until they consolidate according to what is suitable.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate: then treat them again with a more vigorous rubbing than the first, until they bleed much, and then treat them, until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inverse and non-inverse piles, and of anal fistulas, and of boils.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and pain happens from them when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore that what is around the nail be cut, and that it be held with forceps, or with a hook, and that it be eradicated from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it, and if you want to cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From dry Athelil, one is a small, rough, filtred, round eminence on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the treatment of it is, that you stretch out the Athelil, and cut it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with a needle, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you want, cauterize it according to what was previously said with fire, or with sharp medicine: and now both inverse and non-inverse Athelil are eradicated with an instrument that I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A boil is also a small, filtred, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going deep into the flesh: and when it encounters cold, it feels like the biting of a ant, and it occurs in the whole body: and most often it occurs on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the treatment of it is, that you take a small tube from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather: and put that tube on the boil, until the circle of the tube holds in the parts of it.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the cannula, until you reach what is in the vicinity of the anthill; and you will put it in the depth of the flesh, and you will eradicate the anthill from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you need to, do that with a bronze or iron cannula, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn to the underside, so that a covering is produced, in order that the grip on the finger may be alleviated and its own rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you need to, cauterize the anthill according to what has been previously stated regarding cauterization in the chapter on the cauterizer.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Of the forms of instruments which are administered for clysters in diseases of the anus, and of relaxation of the belly, and of colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes the clyster is made of silver, or of gold, or of forged copper, or of hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes they are made small and large from these instruments, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered for the treatment of little children should be little; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, thus also their clysters.
Clistere magnum.	A large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	A small clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cannula of it, that is, the upper head in which the thread is tied, should be spacious according to this method: and it should have a distinction so that the thread may be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus, should be rounded, that is, not open, gentle, strong, drawn to subtlety: and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the threads, and a little thicker, and there should be a thread in which medicines are placed from the intestine of an animal: or from paper, which is according to the form of a small asafoetida: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be perforated with many holes as the revolver suggests, and let there be a space which is between every hole the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread made from crude thread, which is of ten threads or about that, and apply to it the ureter like a sponge.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the ureter is placed in it, let it be tied at the head with strong constrictions between two distinguishing ligatures.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then tie it up with that.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle of the ureter depicted here, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of tying with it, is: that you fill the ureter or bladder with medicine, which is warmed according to the quantity of the tolerance of the weak person: and beware lest it be very hot or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the weak person should lean on his back, and lift his thighs upwards: and put under him a mattress, that is, a skin on which men lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the extremity of the clyster with oil, or with the white of an egg, or with the mucus of the fenugreek, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the assistant take the ureter with both hands together, and express it with vehemence, until he evacuates all that is in the clyster into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then extract the Clyster, and let the weak person lift his thighs to his belly.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	Which if the medicine compels it to come out, then let him hold as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is even more useful for healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If however you clyster him for illnesses of the belly, and his excretion is hastened: then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	What if there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or painful apostems, then let there be a subtle and mild suppository from those suppositories with which children are treated.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a subtle suppository placed on a strictured skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the cure of head wounds without fracture of bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head 83 or Head Eighty-three
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division on the cure of wounds that which belonged to the book, and I will say here the cure of them with the hand, and with medicines according to the complement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore, that wounds are differentiated according to what the wounds are made of, and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things by which wounds are made are often such as a throw of a stone: or a cut of a sword, or a blow with a knife: or a strike with a spear, or a stick, or an arrow: and similar to those from many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that are made according to the places of the body are such as a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver: and similar from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling the cures of certain wounds, so that I may set down this reasoning and rule concerning the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: since the discussion of complicated cases will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When there is a simple wound on the head and it is not a fracture of bone: consider then if it is from a throw of a stone, or something similar, and has only broken the skin: and it is a large wound, and above an uncertain apostem, and a hot euent: then hasten, and perform bloodletting on the head immediately: and do not delay it: and extract from it blood according to the quantity of its virtue: if there is nothing that prohibits bloodletting, especially if the blood which comes out of the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the weak man beware of overeating and wine and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If anything prohibits diminishment, then he will diminish from food and not approach meats nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the wound if there happens to him a hot aposteme, a plaster made with oil of rose alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are secure from a hot aposteme, then put on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and the air has not yet changed it, a powder which I will describe after a little while: and if the air has already changed it, then put on it certain ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large, or is from a cut of a sword and similar, and its lips do not come together with pus, then bring them together with a suture, according to what I will describe for wounds of the belly concerning their suture.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound has already been torn from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a little suspension, then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore to it hard flesh in place of skin, and order the weak person to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as are heads and cooked wheat, until he is like a pulse: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	What if you find in the skin a rotting, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut away the entire rotten part, and cast it away: then treat the area.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however in these wounds there is an artery or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then apply above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a spatula, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if necessity demands when that which we have said does not suffice, then cauterize it, until the blood is stopped.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however the wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy, light: so that you powder over them this powder: because it consolidates them before it changes their appearance.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of the powder for incarnation.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of olibanum and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: pound the whole thoroughly, and sift: and fill the wound with it, and bind with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it above with little cloths, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not become an aposteme.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine should not be eradicated from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when lime alone does that, when olibanum and dragon's blood are not at hand, and also dragon's blood performs the same operation in many great wounds, when it is suitable to be put on them and bound, and they are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	For if the air has already altered them by some alteration, especially when it is in summer time, then it is not in a position for the intention of this powder: therefore treat it with what we have said, so that you put on them certain digestive ointments: or put on them plasters made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat the remaining ones with treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens with a wound that there is a fracture of the bone, and it is small, then extract it with a gesture: and I will later speak of the treatment of fractures of the head in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of neck wounds.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference between its treatment and that of a head wound when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If the nerve of the neck has already been cut, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no cleverness in it, except that its treatment must be combined with what causes vehement constriction, such as lycium and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For they injure the nerves and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: for the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most elevated of the membranes: and let that with which it is treated be mild medicines, such as calx lota with sweet water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil and tutia, when it is also washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then administer a suture: or constrict its lips with powders.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound has depth, or if a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus has already collected, then perforate it in the most depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	For if an artery has been cut in the wound and a flow of its blood has followed, then separate it, or cut it off, and ligate it: or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the spongy parts of the throat have been cut, or all of it, and the alhaugei have been saved: then bring together the lips of the skin with a suture over the cane of the throat, and do not touch the throat, but equal it, and reduce it to its natural figure.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten it with a decent stricture, and diminish it for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments in which there is astringency and excitation, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then perforate it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them, or as many as you can: and what is not prepared, let it be, until the wound putrefies, and is separated and the protrusion is alleviated.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	What if the wound is fresh, then powder over it the powder that I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If however a bone is seen in the wound and a fistula forms: then treat it with that which I have mentioned in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On the wound of the shoulder blade.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a thrust of a lance or a dagger: and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore foulness exits from the wound, when it is breathed out from it by the weak, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	What if the depth is not to it, and it is fresh with its blood: then do not put on it powder from the first hour, nor tighten it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the weak person: but put on it an attractive ointment, and dress it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If indeed the ointment is not present to you, then put on the mouth of the wound old cotton, so that it sucks out what exits from it from its humidities: and make the weak person sleep on the wound, so that what accumulates in it runs.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed the wound has already passed three days, or more, and it does not happen to the weak person a spasm, nor a bad trembling of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see its other dispositions good: then know that the wound is saved.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Treatment is thus applied to it with bandages, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If the healing of the ulcer is excavated and it always opens, then you should know that a fistula has already been formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Treatment is thus applied to it from its own source or chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut of a sword or a knife, and it is superficial on the chest or back: then treat it with what was previously mentioned concerning stitching, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however it has already made an impression on the bone, and a fragment of it has cut in: then examine the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If indeed they are not separated, then leave them alone, until the wound becomes putrid, for the extraction of them will be alleviated.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment of treatment for other accidental wounds in other limbs, is the same as what we have already said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	On the wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestines, and their treatment.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs to the abdomen is great, moderate, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great one, therefore, sometimes the intestine comes out, or the contents of the intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Because their protrusion is more vehement and difficult to treat.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also becomes difficult from another mode.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows therefore, that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hasten to push them back into their place immediately: because they become swollen, open, and enlarged: which makes their re-entry difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Because of this therefore, a moderate disruption is better than the others: since with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of a vein is secondary to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common suture lines come together in the suture of the vein, and in the suture of the other wounds of the body; and two other sutures properly communicate with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	But they are more properly associated with the suture of the vein: and I will describe to you each one with exposition, and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, that when the wound is small, and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then it is on account of one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either on account of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said: or because there is inflammation in the intestine on account of cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is thus, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you immerse a sponge, or a moist cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil in water cypress, and cumin, and spike, and chamomile, and apply it to the intestine, until the inflammation is relieved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	And sometimes make a wine in which there is astringency: and it is better than water alone for relieving inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflammation is already relieved, then moisten the intestine with water in which has been decocted marshmallow or mallow.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that will be alleviated its entrance with something of little importance.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if the return of it is hurried after this cure, then make an incision in the small disruption, with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when prepared, than the incision: and there is no need to cut after necessity and lack of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted and acute, and the other part not acute, and the extremity not be subtle with the subtlety of Spatula, but rather more obtuse for a little while: and it is that which resembles a probe, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, then it is necessary that there be a reduction of it according to its natural shape in its own place, if possible, over that, because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the weak one lie on its back, and put its legs higher than its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then put its head and chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it is necessary, that you administer it in large wounds, and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, put it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make that the attendant between your hands, a careful servant, who holds the whole disruption with his hand, and bring together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then let him who follows sew from it something after something, and this is the manner of a common suture of one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's width.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then measure from the edge of the disruption a quantity of a finger's breadth, that is, of a doctor's, and insert one needle besides what you put thread in both edges of the skin, with two edges of the suture which is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and now you have brought together two edges of the skin, and two edges of the suture: and they become four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with double thread around the needle several times on both sides at once, until the two lips of the wound are brought together by a decent union.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then diminish the thickness of the finger also, and fix another needle in it: afterwards tie it with a thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to do that with what you insert from the needles, until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be medium between thickness and fineness: for subtle needles easily penetrate the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: because of that it is necessary that they be medium in fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not suitable that the needle be fixed in two extremes of the skin close together: so that the flesh does not penetrate quickly, and the wound opens before its consolidation, and they do not stretch also with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not injure the weak place at its sleep: and put pillows made of cloth on every side, which hold the ends of the needles: and leave them, until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For one or two needles, or around them, are sufficient for the suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common suture is to gather with the suture four ends: two ends of the skin, and two ends of the thread in place of one, with a needle in which there is an equal thread in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you penetrate with the needle these four ends, bring the needle back from the side where you began, so that the tied thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that it is a suture, like the suture of cloth that clothes are stitched with, and put between every suture the thickness of a smaller finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	Men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I myself sewed up a wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a major disruption of the wound the size of one palm, and about two palms had come out of his intestines from the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I put back that which after it had stood, his intestine outside of the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was then consolidated in the space that it had been, for about 15 days: and I treated it, and it healed: and he lived after that for many years, living out his natural term.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where no ointment was to be found, nor any of the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I put a old cloth over the wound, twice a day, and I persevered with washing it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	But I will describe two proper types of suture according to the account of the discourse.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with a sharp suture, and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle thus penetrates the skin, and into the flesh equally along the length and width of the whole body: leave the thread end on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer in the other flesh on the opposite side.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this same side of the flesh from the outer part to the inner: and leave the thread end which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other side from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration that you make it penetrate in the thread end of the flesh, which is on its side, until it penetrates into the whole.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then seize also from this same side and its extremity, which is the spleen on the other side, and extract the needle from the skin that it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it to that skin, and its extremity of the spleen, which is on the other side, with this extremity of the spleen: and extract it from the skin which is on its side, and make one suture, and another: and make that suture after the suture, until you have sewn all of it according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture, is that you should sew like those who sew pelles: so that you have one suture on one side of one extremity of the skin: and that you should pass it to the other side, until you complete.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of its own suture, which Galenus called.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech of his has been related, that they sew it according to a likeness, which some physicians do, so that they bring every part to its neighboring part fitting by nature: and apply the extremity of the spleen to its other extremity, and the extremity of the spleen to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I relate to you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you thrust the needle into the extremity of the spleen nearest to you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the interior in that alone: and let two extremities of the spleen pass through.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle around, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the interior in the two extremities of the spleen, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both around, and also make both penetrate from the interior to the exterior, into the two other extremities of the spleen, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of sewing is better than the common and easy suture, and it is a suture whose mention came before.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is the treatise of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the wound is reinforced with two stitches.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, you insert into them a single thread: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew skins equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the wound, then its suture is more difficult than that of the other places of the wound.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of the rest of the wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you treat a fresh wound with its own blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and sew it, and adapt it: then put on top an incarnative powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	That if the air has already altered the wound: then put on top of it certain ointments, which are present to you, until they produce pus: and fall apart the threads, and consolidate the flesh, and form a scar.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as is the treatment of the other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If however the medicines are not present to you, then put on top of it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, an old dressing: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not apply other medications in many treatments, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however you fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary to immerse a woolen thread tempered with warm oil, or in rose oil: and put it around the places that are between the groin, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	That if it feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in its intestines (for many times this happens) then clysterize it with a styptic wine, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already penetrated to the intestine, and an ulcer has been made which penetrates to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you should know that what is from the thick intestine is of easier treatment and what is from the thin is of more difficult treatment.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine which is called the Jejunum does not receive treatment from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, that it is from many veins, and their greatness, and because of the thinness of its body, and because of the closeness of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If what proceeds from the wound is feces, and you catch it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If indeed it has passed beyond the space, and already it has become green or black: then it is necessary that you constrict it with a thread above the place which has become discolored from it, so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the intestine there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and put two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so that the pulling of it may be alleviated by you, and the extraction of it in case of intestine, and the emission of pus of the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	The treatment of a wound which occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there occurs a disruption in the Intestine and it is small: then it is possible that it be restored in some men: because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a thrust of a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound became chronic, and a fistula was formed, and there came out from it a discharge and gas.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I applied therefore the treatment, until I was not confident in its healing: nor did I cease to treat it subtly, until it was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the weak, that which would happen to the weak would befall a disease in its stomach: and there did not befall it from that a befalling disease.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And it remained in its better dispositions, eating and drinking, and blowing, and it entered a bath, and was exercised in its diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now certain experimenters have said, that when a wound happens in the intestine and is small: then it should be tied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you take the poultices of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and put one poultice among those that have an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it has seized upon them, and closed its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and is not loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another poultice near the first, and do not cease to do that with a poultice after a poultice according to the quantity of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it itself, and its own wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached to the intestine, until the intestine is healed and cured, and no harm befalls the weak.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible that the intestine be tied with a subtle thread: which is taken from the intestine of an animal, and attached to it after it has been thrust into a needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and much flesh comes out.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie at its end a subtle flaxen thread wound around.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then thrust that thread into the needle, and sew up the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it itself to a push.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of sewing with poultices and intestine is not but according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	One knows a wound that is great and large, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines: then there is no ingenuity except subtlety, and there is not its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound or abscess when it becomes old and chronic, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then it is universally called a fistula in whichever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is indeed a hard, white, calloused and blocked nodulation, with which there is no pain, to which is similar the hollow of a bird's feather: and because of that some people call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours wet, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is discharged at certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and is little: and it is thick, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already stated in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor is born in it flesh, is not that except on account of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of which is, or on account of the smallness of blood in the body: or on account of its malice: or because between it and above its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the birth of flesh: or because it is much filth and foulness: or because the ulcer in itself is rotten, and the matter which is applied to it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is inconvenient for its cure: or because corruption falling in the region is a type of pestilence, or by property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which difficult digestion of fevers occurs, and delayed healing of abscesses by nature: or because in it there is one mouth, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division; and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For some of them are Fistulas that pass to the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the diaphragm, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the composite joints: such as the hand, and foot: and some of them are which approach nearness of the principal member, and similar things.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which therefore of these Fistulas is in this manner, is from diseases of difficult healing, and does not receive cure, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	What if it is from the Fistulas any of whose depth does not penetrate to these places which I said: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and you use to penetrate to the knowledge of it, then take a probe made of brass, or iron, if the Fistula tends according to straightness, and inquire into it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If however in the Fistula there is crookedness, then investigate it with a probe of refined lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, with gentleness of its body, enters and bends around the crookedness.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	What if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to investigate about it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore stop up one of its openings from its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture that you stop it with, goes towards the other openings, and flows out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully and precisely inquire according to which method it is possible for you: to know what that is a hole, or a nerve, and is the long or short concavity of the Fistula: or is one Fistula with many openings, and stand on all that, with the greatest strength of yours: with your questioning, with which you question the weak, and the discovery of pain upon compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and causes occurring in the examination.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you stand upright over all those stations of urine, then proceed to cure according to confidence: and it is, as you consider then, if there is a fistula appearing nearby or in a healthy place far from the joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places that I told you: then cut the fistula according to what was previously mentioned in my narration, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh, which grows in its opening from flesh, or thelul, and similar things: and cure it, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If the fistula is of deep and distant depth, and is according to straightness: then it is necessary that you cut it as deeply as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply unbroken bandages in sharp medicines: and insert them up to the concavity of the fistula which you grasped with the iron: do that repeatedly, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remained in the concavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal by means of that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	When the cause of the fistula is an opening, and it is confirmed by you: then investigate it, and cut it according to what I have narrated to you: if nothing prohibits you from the vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	When the opening is detected by you, and there is in it something of corruption, and blackness: then scrape it, until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with what makes flesh grow on it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	What if it does not heal, and discharges pus as it was doing: then know that you did not attain the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Cut down on that second, and make a careful incision of it, and cleansing of the same with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If then it is healed, it is good: and if not, then you should know that the corruption is in the depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	There is therefore no ingenuity for you in it, except to entrust it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	What is corrupted of the small mouth, and it is possible for you, draw it out with subtle forceps that convene to it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If however there are many bones, then make a careful pulling of all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If indeed something from the humidity makes an obstacle for you, and there is no fear of incision or error: then cut those humidities and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed you are not prepared to remove the bones from the hour of your treatment, then apply on the wound what will putrefy it: and leave it, until it putrefies what is around those bones of flesh and humidity.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the section which you cut in your operation be bound with a bandage.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Below put on it, if you wish, cotton submerged in sulphur beaten with oil: or cotton submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some of the green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humidities putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, the removal of them will be facilitated, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If however there is one large bone, such as the bone of the thigh, or the hip bone, and similar to these, and a large part of it is corrupted: then scrape it with a final scraping, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If the bone which is in it has become corrupted, and is a large part, and the corruption has already affected the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it entirely up to the place where the corruption penetrates: then treat it, until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you a story about a man who had an injury on his thigh: so that you may take it as an example and aid to your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a man of youthful age, about thirty years old, to whom pain occurred in his thigh, from a cause which moved upon it within the body, that is, from the interior, until the materials reached the thigh and it became an aposteme, a large aposteme: and there was not an external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	The time passed with it until the error of the doctors, until the aposteme opened, and many materials flowed out with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And the treatment of it was put off, until the thigh became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus, and the bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	A multitude of doctors treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art among them, until I was called, and I saw his thigh, and the materials which flowed out from those openings with a great flow: also the whole body of the man had already wasted away, and its color was citrine.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I then inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached to the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I thoroughly examined all the openings: and I found that they connected to a sinus coming from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I cut around one of those openings, until I exposed a piece of bone: and I found it corrupted, which had already been gnawed away, and was blackened, and putrid, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I will scrape off what has been detected by me and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I scraped off what was not in the bone except that corruption which I cut away and scraped.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I will now eradicate it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it is not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I felt and probed on the bone a second time above the first detection, and I found continuous corruption with the bone, and I scraped off what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I probed then on it again, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut out about one palm from the bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this iteration in the operation of it, and its section, would not have been necessary, except because of the disposition of debility and infirmity, and the smallness of its tolerance, and my fear concerning it of death: for it happened to him in every hour from an excess of evacuating bad syncopy.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was healed therefore by a complete healing: and hard flesh was born in the place of the bone, and good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he changed in his dispositions: and walking did not cause him any harm at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If the bone is prominent in the place of the body and already broken, then it is necessary to scrape it, according to this method: and it is that you take a ligature, and tie it on the extremity of the prominent bone: and tell someone to pull it upwards: and put another ligature made from coarse wool over the first ligature.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it above the flesh that is under the bone and stretch out the extremity so that you pull the flesh to the lower parts and you cut the flesh above the place you want to saw, so that the saw does not wound the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Put a stick or a board under the lower bone decently: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be above the corrupted place for a little while, so that the corruption is not in the concavity of the bone, and does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels to saw itself instead of another.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	Which if the bone is corrupted and is not prominent, namely the continuous part of it with a part: and the corruption is in the middle of it or in a part of it: then cut the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then put a stick below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues from the other part: and let the sawing be according to the length from the corruption for a little while, according to what we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	Which if the corruption is in the joint, cut out the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no ingenuity in it except for scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	Which if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or in the sole of the foot: then the matter in it is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is necessary that you investigate how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it and clean it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever ingenuity is straightened for you: when the vein or nerve does not make a contradiction for you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the incisions and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the situation of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and size, and smallness, and hardness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Wherefore it is necessary that you prepare every kind of instrument suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you above the species of an instrument which you need when there is lengthy study with you.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the modes of this art is a testimony of the modes of diseases: then indeed you will find by yourself that which suits it from instruments for every weakness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I will establish for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will pose as examples on which you will stumble, and a test by which you will experience regarding others.
Forma Serrae.	The shape of a saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the other saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of a saw depicted should be made from iron.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper bow be sharp, its edge of iron: and its handle of boxwood, and let it be made pyramidal.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of a razor for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be according to the shape of the head of a star-shaped key: and its points be according to the shape of the points of a lancet.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not fit, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they are corroded, or the mouth is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of a larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The shape of a middle-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The shape of a broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of a razor in which there is a cavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape of another subtle razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of a razor with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of a small razor, of subtle handling.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of a razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape also of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a file, and the extremities are like a saw: it is shown in many places from the rasping of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of a rasp that suits the rasping of that which is perforated by bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremities are triangular, and it is sharp at the extremities.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from Indian steel.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And it is similarly necessary that all the things we have spoken of be made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Of the cutting of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities rot, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated that corruption with medical cures, and the cure is not effective: and you see the corruption falling upon a member, which nothing has struck: then it is necessary that you cut into that member as far as the corruption has reached, so that the weak man may be freed from death, or from an evil which is a greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign to which this happens is that the member becomes blackened, until it rots: as if fire has consumed it, or it has rotten after the blackening: until the rottenness is cut into, as far as that which follows the member, and creeps into the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	It is suitable therefore with the cutting of it, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain poisonous things: such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and weasel, and similar things.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption or sting is in the extremity of a finger, then cut into the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, so that it may not proceed as far as the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it out from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption, until it takes hold in the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades into it, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If on the other hand corruption passes through and you see it around the elbow then there is death of the weak limb.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from the cure, is a quantity of virtues.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And do similarly for the foot, when corruption invades into the toe, then cut it at one of the joints: and if it takes hold in the body of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	What if corruption has already gone beyond the knee, then there is no ingenuity in it, except to let go and abandon the weak one to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting a limb or sawing it is to tie a ligature below where you want to cut, and tie another ligature above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one assistant stretch one ligature downwards to the lower parts and let another assistant stretch the upper ligature upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures with a broad spatula until the whole flesh is laid bare.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then let it be cut or sawed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is fitting that you put a linen cloth on all parts, and the saw does not touch the healthy place: and an injury added to the weak one, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however there is an issue of a flow of blood internally while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or put on it certain powders that stop the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage suitable for it, and take care of it, until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man with his foot, the same thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What is it, that a blackness occurs on its foot with a burning which is similar to the burning of fire and that corruption first occurs on its toe until it affects the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	It put out a man from itself, after it had seen the corruption befalling the limb with its swelling, which it found from the pain and burning of it, and it befalls at the joint and it was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, that same corruption occurred to him on the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me and I attempted to cure that excess with what I applied on the hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body, and the excess did not push back, and it began to enter into another finger until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called for me to cut his hand and I was unwilling to do it, hoping for a pushing back of that excess from me, and I also feared death for him in the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's strength was on the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he had given up hope in me, he returned to his land, and he came back to me because of that, which he had done hastily, and he cut his whole hand, and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not add this account except as an aid for that which falls from the type of this disease and as a signification which is signified and according to which it is acted.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of abscesses, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members and the space of the abscess extends until it makes a collection of pus: then it breaks or is perforated, and what is in it of pus comes out, and the empty place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it like cloth that has already been worn thin: and it does not reach to the end in its corruption, nor does it press on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called an abscess: and it is not called a Fistula: nevertheless if its space extends until the corruption presses on any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or a false passage.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the treatment of it is that you cut the entire wound as it was previously turned out, and especially when it has been subtly divided and made like a cloth, and you are confident because it will not adhere to the place due to its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere and it does not follow from it the last corruption of the union, and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster, and it is so that you should consider regarding the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it is of foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ginger, taking equal parts, mixed together in a vase, and decocted over fire, until the medicine turns red, and comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need, and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the sinus with it, and constrict its opening, and put the medicine into it for the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression: do this for as many days as until the sinus is cleaned and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you clysterize with water of ash, when this medicine is not present to you, and it is that you take the ash of grapevines or the ash of holm oak trees, and cast water upon it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then mix it and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the sinus has already been washed out.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	What if the weak one is not able to tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor water of ash, then clysterize it with water and honey, in which something has already been mixed from crushed ginger.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clysterize it with honey and wine mixed together, since it is a property of honey that it cleanses and washes, and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of dryness and astringency in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do that several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has already been removed: then put a suppository on it along with what makes flesh grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is that you take from the plaster dyafinicon, and dissolve it with rose oil and styptic wine, or put a suppository on it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	What if the orifice of the sinus is constricted, in which the cannula of the clyster does not fit: then widen it with iron for a little while: or put a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment or in royal ointment on it, until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also too wide, then bring its lips together with a suture: and reduce from it the quantity in which the clyster can enter without obstruction.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated upwards: then make an incision in the lower place that is in it, so that the pus may run out downwards: for when pus is confined in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	What if it is not possible for you to make an incision in the sinus around its lower part according to what you want: then try to prepare a membrane with a preparation so that pus may run out of it with ease according to what you have prepared.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try that nothing of the pus remains in it at all: and take consolidating medicines which are put on the wound, suitable for what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that it makes contact with the whole sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps directly at the orifice of the sinus a hole, slightly larger than the orifice of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread from mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole: and put it over the orifice, positioned lengthwise away from the orifice of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it is eased: and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days, once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That one, however, which is above the orifice of the sinus, is that which you remove at every hour, so that what accumulates in it from pus may exit: and so that you know, whether that which flows out from it is a lot, or a little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether the master of it feels pain in it, or there is not pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is not an abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your medication is thus extended, and you see the material which exits above the orifice of the sinus, then know that the sinus already adheres, or approaches adherence: then therefore loosen it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you loosen the wound, then change the dressing to another, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If however there exits from the sinus after a long space subtle pus, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, since there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act to the contrary of that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however there exits from the sinus after many days undigested pus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adherence of the sinus is delayed, and its condition is prolonged: then add to the desiccation of medicines, true ones which doctors make, so that they are medicines in their own humid substance, and in their own dry virtue: such as the ointment dyafinicon, when there is added to it an excess of addition from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And of the greatest last thing by which it is cured, is that you take the ointment dyafinicon, and dissolve it with rose oil, and apply upon it old equal wine in its own substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now perform a similar action to this, when you do not have the ointment of dyafinicon present, melt the honey, when you have decocted it, until it becomes thick and anoint with it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh and aloe and benzoin: grind all together, and pulverize it over the honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then smear over it a cloth, and bind it over the wound: and anoint it with honey which you have decocted, until it has thickened: and pulverize the spices over it, and put over it a cloth, and bind them.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when the treatment is administered there is aristolochia longa, and roots of celestial lily, and it is lily: and flour of the herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or mixed, grind them, and sieve them: and pulverize over the honey which I have described, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the matter of the wound should be prolonged, and it is not healed by this treatment: then know that there is a corruption in its depth: or now it makes an impression on the bones, or on the remaining hard members, or on the ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of Fistulas, according to what has been previously stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the treatment of a panaritium and a worn away nail, and an incised toe, and a cut.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A panaritium is an abscess that grows under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it grows on the other toes.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When it is prolonged and the treatment of it is neglected, and it becomes an abscess with a hot abscess: or it becomes rotten, and it emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it entirely rots it, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the bone, until it has a foul smell: and the extremity of the toe becomes large, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you raise your treatment with what we said in the division, and your treatment does not work: then it is necessary to cut with iron all the excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cauterization is a strong remedy.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the additions of empty nail now press on the flesh inside, and begin to pierce it, and wound it: then it is necessary that you put a fine pumice under the angle of the nail which pierces the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut that flesh with ease, and put on top of what remains of the flesh from medicinally caustic and corrosive remedies, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the corruption has already made an impression on the bone, then it is necessary that you cut out that bone, and extract it: for it will not be healed as long as the corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	What if you see corrosion and corruption entering into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to which a previous mention has been made.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however a bruise of the nail or a blow occurs, and there is severe pain in it, then it is necessary to perform bloodletting on the weak part first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp razor from top to bottom across.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And beware, lest the cut penetrate to the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause through that a severe pain on the weak part, and it will be a cause for the growth of extra flesh in the location.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with what soothes pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger which is added to the birth in some hands of men is perhaps entirely fleshy and perhaps there are bones in some of them and perhaps there is a nail in it and some of them are born at the root of the joint or they are born in some nodes of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	That one which is born at some nodes of the finger does not move and that one which is born at the joint of the finger perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	The cutting of that one which of them is fleshy is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, you cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The treatment of that one whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one which is born on the finger at the last node, then it is necessary to cut the flesh first with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The joining together which occurs to the fingers, often happens either from the birth of the man, that is, it is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is necessary therefore to cut away that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then put between them lint or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them, or put between them a subtle sheet of lead, until the place is consolidated according to what is necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if there occurs a joining to some fingers with the palm, then cut away that joining according to what prepares and suits the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On the Incision of a Varicose Vein.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are varicose veins, which are enlarged, and full of melancholic superfluities, which occur in many parts of the body: and they most often happen in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and laborers.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is necessary therefore to administer a strong purging of the body from black bile by repeated strong purging.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then perform bloodletting on the patient in that vein which is called basilica.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of them with an iron instrument is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is, that they should be cut and black blood extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is, that the vein should be lifted up, and entirely extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First immerse the leg in warm water abundantly, until the gross and foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the weak leg from the upper part of its thigh to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then lift, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from above it is necessary that you should perform bloodletting on the weak one first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the vein to the lower part until a quantity of blood comes out which you see is sufficient and which the strength of the weak one can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods which generate black bile, and also evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and that harms the weak one.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The lifting of it is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Scrape the weak leg, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then insert it into a bath, or soak it in its sheath with hot water until it becomes red and the veins become swollen, or let it be exercised with strong exercise if a bath is not available to it until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin in the direction of the vein's section along its length, or at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and clear the vein from every part until it becomes apparent to sensation, and at its appearance, that which you see is a decline from redness to blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it emerges from the skin, you see it as a white thread, as if it were a tendon.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert the needle under it, until when it is raised and comes out of the skin: suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut another section near that section, three fingers apart.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then clear the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it becomes apparent.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise it with the needles as you have done, and suspend it with another hook, as you have done at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section, or several sections, if it is necessary for that purpose.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then raise and cut it at the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you pull it out from the section which is higher, or higher than all sections, until when the whole comes out: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to be pulled out and raised: then insert a needle with a strong thread double, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert the needle under it: and move your hand to every part, until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it be cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to elevate it, and from it an injury will occur to the weak part.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have extracted it entirely, then apply to the wound a wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and treat it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	What if the vein is contracted, having a twisted condition with an involvement of parts, and it is not as we have said according to rectitude: then it is necessary that you find on it for all the part of its twisting, and the place of its involvement.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you elevate it entirely: and beware at your dissection above it lest you cut the vein, or wound: for it will be difficult for you to elevate, or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Preserve therefore your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of the incision by which a vein is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of a blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have curvature like the rest of the hooks, nor is it of sharp extremity, so that it does not wound the vein: and it is of thick flexibility, gentle: for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein with its subtlety: indeed let it be superfluous grossness, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the saphena vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands of little tenderness, that is, in which no herb or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as occur in bodies of serpents and worms, ascarids, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the inception of this vein is a severe inflammation which occurs in the thigh.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place should be warmed.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that warming, as if it were a root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore the extremity of it appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight is one or two drachms, and tie it, and let the suspended lead hang from the thigh.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something comes out from it to the outside, wrap that in lead, and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	What if it is prolonged a great deal, then cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root until the whole thing has come out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and returns into the flesh: and causes an aposteme to form, and decay in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Wherefore it should be treated gently and extracted gradually, until it comes out entirely from its end, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein comes out in some men what is five palms long.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has happened to me that a man came out with it twenty palms long.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If however it is cut during the time of your treatment: then introduce the needle into its opening, and perforate it with a long needle, with a thread, until everything that is in it of material comes out: and administer putrefaction to the place with medicines for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the cure for apostemes.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle of the foot, or in the foot itself: and there are many openings to it, and a branch comes out from each opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Treat it itself, as we have said in the division, and with what has been mentioned beforehand.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On the excision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called bovine disease in a certain land among us: therefore, because it often happens to cattle, and there is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it wanders throughout the whole body, going up and down: and it is shown to the sense during its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks out wherever it breaks out on the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes happen, that is, intestinal worms, and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared on account of its wickedness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when it wanders in the body, and rises to the head, and reaches the place: then perhaps it opens in it, and emerges, and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure it, and extract it, then it is not done unless during its movement, and the appearance of it to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore, that you tie what is above it, and what is below it with a strong constricting bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it: then put a cauterization with fire on the place, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And what is feared most, is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then tie beneath it the eyebrow with a good tight bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is fitting that the weak person should use a cleansing of his body with medicines that dissolve rotten and foul humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Of the cutting upon the disease of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called in our land Nakir, and it is a pain which occurs in certain members, then it changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I indeed have already seen it, according to what I relate to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a weak woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she exposed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for one hour, I saw a swelling enter with the tendon, as the worm enters, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be, so that it is like living silver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain therefore receded from that place and became fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it wandered throughout her whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed therefore at the swiftness of its change from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I indeed had not seen this disease before with my eyes in this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However I saw many who find the pain changing from member to member, and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is anything but because she was one of those who are from villages with a body dried out by detected veins, hence the changed condition appears to the sense.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this method in those who are delicate and have humid bodies of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you apply the treatment and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to your eye, as we have said, then tie above it and below it quickly: and cut above it, until that constricted windiness comes out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with purging of the body, and with that which expels windiness, and cleanses them with foul-smelling pills, and pills of serapion, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are differentiated according to their own kinds and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is this: that among them are those which have large and small heads, and are concave, and obverse.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those which have barbs.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those which have stars or studs.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those however which are according to the limbs in which they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the limbs are from the principal hollow members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and their likes.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any of these members, and death signs appear to you, which I will tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you should hasten the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in most cases.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and exits through the siphac which is above the brain, are: because there occur from that swelling of the brain, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflation, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood exits from the nostrils, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white humidity similar to poultice exits from the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there exits from it something similar to the washing of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from cure, and extract the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left breast: and he feels with it as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in a hollow thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of a pulse: and black blood runs out from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it is followed by coldness of the extremities, and a cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore, that death descends without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung, is the exit of foamy blood from the wound: and the vessels that follow the neck become swollen, and the color of the weak person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he exhales a great, high breath: and seeks an attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	For if the arrow falls into the membrane, which is in the breast: then it is near the short ribs: and there is made a great panting with vehement pain, with sighing: and all the members of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it will come out of the wound with some undigested food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly and is fixed in it, something of dung will come out of the wound, or a piece of the intestine, or the gut which has already been torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope in its cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	What if an arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out, and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the weaker parts, then you should know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder, and arm, and spine of the back, and elbow, and hip, and leg, and their likes among the limbs are saved according to various dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery or a nerve: and it is not a poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I relate to you what I have seen concerning the removal of these arrows, so that you may understand through it about your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is, because to a certain man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore extracted it from him on the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye below his lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not take out more of it except a small end, with which it adhered to its wooden shaft: and it was a large arrow among the arrows of Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there were no notches.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no bad accident happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and this is that which has barbs.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I cut on the same thing between two fingers, and now it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was careful with it, until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the man into whom it had fallen in his belly, and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed for him, and nothing of his condition had changed, I cut above the arrow, and I probed above it, and I extracted it, and he was healed, and no bad accident happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound was consolidated above it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Afterwards it was after seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound was consolidated above it, and the arrow remained inside her, and nothing of her condition was changed, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen into his face, and the wound was consolidated, and it remained, not finding much pain for him, and many things similar to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from one of the king's nobles, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and it had declined to the right side a little, and the arrow was totally hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called then to his treatment after the accident of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the wound of the arrow constricted strongly.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I examined it with a subtle probe, and I did not feel it, and he himself found puncture and pain under his right armpit.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	The spear was removed, therefore that puncture was from the extremity of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I applied a plaster to the spot with a plaster in which there was an attractive and digestive virtue, trusting with me that it would bring forth the place and the sign of the arrow would appear to me so I could cut above it, and no accident happened in the place indicating that the arrow had contaminated the spot.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I treated it diligently with a plaster for many days, and no accident occurred, and the wound was consolidated meanwhile; and he remained weak from the extraction of that space for some days, until he felt the arrow on a certain day inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I applied therefore to that wound a sharp medicine, corroding for many days, until it was opened: and when I probed it, I felt the extremity of the arrow subtle which adhered to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the extremity of the arrow appeared visibly to us: and he stayed with me for a space of time around four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	After the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and to move it, and it did not obey for exit: then I did not cease to subtly contrive, and to ingeniously work on it with modes of ingenuity, until I began on it one day with well-made forceps, according to which the shape of them will come in the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And physicians indeed judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it therefore, and the wound was consolidated, and the weak one was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you put that rule and meaning on that which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood with narration: nor does the book comprehend it, and the skilled artisan compares a little with a lot: and with what is present, above that which is absent: and finds a new operation, and a new instrument in the descent of extraneous things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not come out of the members in which they are fixed, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by traction from the place into which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite part of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, is an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place: and is drawn, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	For if it does not obey to exit at the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its attraction is alleviated, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and does not obey you to exit, then leave it also for some days: and move it with attraction and motion every day, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	For if it does not obey you to exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone on every side with a subtle drill, until the arrows are freed.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already proceeded into one of the ventricles of the brain, and there appear from below some of those accidents which I mentioned: then abstain from drawing out the arrow, and leave it, until its condition becomes calm after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	If an arrow passes through to the spleen, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, unless it is only in the body of a bone, and does not penetrate through to the spleen: and he remains weak for some days, and none of those accidents happen to him: then devices are used in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If the arrow is fixed strongly, and does not yield to attraction: then apply drills around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If the arrow has already been concealed in a location of the body, and is hidden and concealed from sensation: then investigate it with probing.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then attract it with certain instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot reach it, on account of the constriction of the wound, and on account of the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is not there a bone, nor a nerve, nor a vein: then probe above it, until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	What if there are to it nerves that hold it, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side, with every device that you can, and devices, if it cannot overcome the protrusion of the flesh in the fracture of the ears, and the twisting of them, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use twisting of your hand, with forceps on all parts, until you make it come out: and manipulate with ultimate subtlety, so that the arrow is not fractured, and its attraction and extraction are not made difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	What if you cannot overcome it in one hour, then leave it for some days, until those things that are around it putrefy.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for the tunic will be loosened, indeed if a flow of blood makes a contrary condition for you, then administer what we have said from the cure in its chapter: and keep your strength away from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer the ingenuity in every way that is possible to you for the removal of the arrowhead: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have narrated to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, that you do when you pull out the arrow, that the weak part be according to the figure, according to which it was in the case of the arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is a greater help.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow which comes out from the opposite part of another, or already proceeds from it something to the exterior: or makes a gibbosity of the extremity of the arrow by sensation from the upper part of the adjacent skin, and you see it prominent: cut therefore over it, and let the section be according to the quantity that the forceps can grasp in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull out the arrow: for it itself becomes easy to exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If indeed it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow presses into the bone, and enlarges itself: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for some days: then repeat it, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	What if the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the wood has fallen, and you want to administer a push: then introduce to it a concave instrument, so that its concavity enters into the tail of the arrow: then push it with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the arrowhead is barbed, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is alleviated through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	Which if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary, that the barbed flesh, in which is the poison, be cut out: if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	Which if the arrow falls in the breast, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and is near to that which you touch with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting the vein, or nerve, and extract it.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Of bloodletting of the vein under the tongue, after the bloodletting of the head.

The benefit of bloodletting of the two veins which are under the tongue is that the bloodletting of the head is for the obstructions which are in the throat, and for ulcers of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins which are bloodlet in the elbow, are those in which bloodletting has become a habit for all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And bloodletting of the ears is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad myrtle-shaped bloodletter, or with a razor to subtlety declined, or by cutting with a knife-shaped bloodletter, and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is, what suits for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are broad and subtle kinds according to the abundance of veins and their constriction The form of the myrtle-shaped bloodletter is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it suits for opening concave, full, protruding, visible, thick veins, and those which contain gross, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this bloodletter is of lesser width, and of more subtle extremity.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it suits for bloodletting of subtle veins, which contain subtle citrine blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On the bloodletting of the basilisk.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	However, the basilisk which is one of these three veins is for bloodletting a youthful remedy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	For it extracts blood from illnesses which are under the throat and neck, because of that which follows the chest and stomach: and it suits the bloodletter to bloodlet with it, so that he may beware, and be above fear of it, for beneath it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs, and adds to the puncture of the bloodletter, he will wound that artery, and there will occur a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Wherefore it is necessary, that the bloodletter does not bloodlet with a puncturing bloodletter: but rather cuts with an Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	For if the basilisk does not appear with a manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you displace it, and change to another, or that you seek some branch of it: or in place of bloodletting, a ligature of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	It is itself evident, and cut it with a scalpel called an escalaparius, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you are going to perform venesection on the same, then it is necessary before tightening of the arm, that you touch the place until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark on the place with a cautery, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave section using a scalpel called Alnesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And let the incision not be deep so that the blow falls through the space to the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, an inflation in the place which you marked with a cautery, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: avoid it therefore.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	For if you see blood at the venesection jumping out, like a child's urine, and it is subtle, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then press closely, and put your finger on it with a long pressure, afterwards remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the blood is therefore cut off (for it is often cut off), then tighten the arm, and release it: and let the weak one beware of its motion: and let him be above its fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for some days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not stop, and overcomes you: and your medicine is not present at the moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For the extremities of it contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the cortex of a mat and bind it: take one middle piece, and tighten it over the place of the vein with a decent stricture, with a ligature and poultices until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with what preceded, recalling from the place powdered abscesses the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many conditions, because of the smallness of the wound's location, and the possibility of ligation from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Of the bloodletting of the dark vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The bloodletting of the dark vein is beneficial, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because it is composed of the Basilic branch and the Cephalic branch, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the bloodletter to be careful with it, so that he is above fear from its bloodletting, for beneath it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the puncture of the bloodletting, and finds the nerve, there occurs on it numbness, and the healing of it becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If however it is hidden in some men, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then it is necessary that you place your bloodletting where you will bloodlet with a cut with Alnesil, and divert the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	For if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The bloodletting of the Cephalic vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the head and helps against diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish, to bloodlet it by pricking with an olive or myrtle phlebotome: because it is a savior of all veins, because there is not beneath it an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Truly it is fitting for you at bloodletting, to divert with the bloodletting the head of the arm as much, and to seek a more tender place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first prick, to repeat over it with bloodletting several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	A true abscess sometimes forms in certain men when not bloodletting on the first percussion, but that abscess does not harm him in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of Bloodletting, and precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of Bloodletting, however, and its accidents from it, in whose correction you ought to consider.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First therefore it is of what you ought to know, that bloodletting is not administered, except in the conservation of health, and its preservation, and caution against the approach of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that bloodletting is performed on one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that bloodletting is done at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in summer, and autumn, and winter after digestion, when signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And bloodletting is done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Bloodletting which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour: but when convenience and necessity demand it, at night, or day, and every hour, and every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not fitting that children be bled, until they have fourteen years upon them.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the aged be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When anyone wants to be bled for any reason: it is necessary, that he cleanse his intestines before bloodletting with a mild clyster, if there is much retained dung in them: so that the veins do not attract from the intestines during bloodletting putrid and harmful superfluities to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should blood be let from a patient who is suffering from nausea, that is, satiety; nor one who is drunken, nor one who is vomiting from intoxication, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor the weak with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let bloodletting be performed again after a colic passion, and vomiting, and flux of the belly, and multiplication of coitus, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and everything that dissolves virtue from the bodily or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider in subtlety of humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let a bath be taken, if nothing prohibits it: or let exercise be undertaken with some exercise, so that the blood may be made subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And let bloodletting be applied to his chest, around the third day, as we have said: and take care, that his chest may be emptied on that day from all bad animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and punishment, and excessive coitus, and things similar.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present the things with which usage has created a habit in men from aromaticity, and fragrance, and rejoicing and similar things to them according to quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the bloodletter sit on a cushion, which is higher than the cushion of the one being bled: afterwards let him draw out his arm, and let the bloodletter rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tie the bandage with a binding, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the binding be tempered, because the binding when it is unequal, or by excess in binding, then prohibits the flow of blood: or in loosening, then also prohibits the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after tightening it is suitable that the hand of the bloodletter is rubbed together meanwhile until the veins become swollen and are revealed to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the bloodletter wipes the bloodletting instrument with a little oil, his own old one.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his index finger of the left hand on the vein beneath the place where he wants to perform the bloodletting, so that the vein does not flee and the puncture is made.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For there is a vein which you do not find like a fleeing cord during bloodletting: and of them is one that is full of wind: and when you place the bloodletting instrument on it, it contracts beneath the instrument, and the bloodletter is deceived, and the instrument does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is constricted: therefore it is necessary that the bloodletter be steady, and be solicitous in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he puts down the bloodletting instrument.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then the vein is opened with one stroke, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then strike it another time in the same place, or above it with speed, if the location is not discolored.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	What if it becomes discolored, or the skin becomes weak, then leave it for a day, or two days: and do not tie the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps the warm discoloration will attract.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let blood again, if it is loved.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	What if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly: and so that not more blood comes out than you want: then strike the bloodletting instrument again in the same opening, according to what is right, and add a little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it with speed, before the location becomes discolored, for a discolored location is in many men during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If then you see that it is already an aposteme, then you do not repeat anything on it, for it does not excuse anything with you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something on it from the dregs of oil, because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your bloodletting, which you perform on veins to prohibit the flow of blood: and they make that the Tyrus and Alfarach, and Sagzenea, when it is put from one of them on the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is refined and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	What if it happens in the place of bloodletting a large aposteme, for it often happens, especially to him who is not accustomed to bloodletting unless by chance or is opening a small vein, then apply and put on the place a sponge soaked in hot water and salt, warmed a little: and bind it for one hour: because it will be resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do that after the blood has come out from the same vein, when its flow is complete, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	What if something of blackness or greenness remains in the place after days, it does not harm: and if you wish, put on it some aloe, or a solvent of myrrh: or something from the juice of mint, that is, calamentum or something similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And often indeed apostemes and swellings occur with bloodletting of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore put your hand on it, then if you find softness upon compressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Beware therefore, that you put on it something of what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make for him a plaster with that in which there is a styptic, so that the place may be induced.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you extract from a man all the blood according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the color conquering over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out, until it becomes red: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it go out, until it becomes subtle: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs the extraction of blood twice, that phlebotomy of the vein be increased, and the phlebotomist be large: and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he extract it in the veins, and that the opening be narrow: and better what is administered in phlebotomy of the vein is, that it be a cross-section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of a nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is customary to faint at phlebotomy of the syncopis, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a moderate bread infused in water of granated myrobalan: or secaniabin, if he is warm: and extract from him blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a frigid complexation, then let him receive before phlebotomy bread infused in syrup of myrrh, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in syrup aromatized with perfume.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If that should happen with syncope during phlebotomy, and is the cause of much blood exiting: then it is necessary to take in a drink of meat water, and subtle odoriferous syrup: and to use aromatics with galia, and to bind its chest with them: and to use the remainder which we said in the division on the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wants to evacuate his arm and release his blood a second time: it is necessary for him, for whom phlebotomy is on account of much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to release the blood little by little according to the quantity of his strength over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Who indeed wants to evacuate his arm and release his blood a second time, and his body is strong: then let him do that after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wants to attract blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines: it is necessary that he be evacuated on the second day, or on the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and it causes fever to happen: it is necessary that blood go out from it at once, and a large quantity be extracted from it: and the opening be widened until syncope happens: after which you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you put your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not happen in place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For it often happens, when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when the use is to release the arm and release the blood a second time, since the opening of the vein has already been closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, so that pressure be applied on it with vehemence, and the curved part be extended quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a disease of the vein, or it diminishes itself, until it is bloodlessly cut with a knife.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove it with the sharpness of a knife the blood clot that has formed in the mouth of the vein, and put on top of it something salty dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put on top of it some tyrical of alfaroch, or sassenea, and apply it with a gentle compression, until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If then the vein has already become an abscess, then cut it, and do not cauterize it, until the abscess has settled.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	What if necessity demands to release the blood with a knife, and there is no excuse, then either perform venesection on it above that place, or on another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The veins of the arm are cut at the place of the axilla and basilic, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its venesection is that the weak hand should be inserted into warm water, until it becomes red and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then let it be tied above it with a moderate constraining bandage.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then perform the venesection across, little by little, not in width, nor along the length, and let it be a wide opening, and your venesection should be where you are going to tie above the joint of the hand for a little while.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	What if the flow of blood is blocked, then put the hand again in warm water, and let the blood run in the water, until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however you are in summer days, then you should be excused from putting the hand again in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And the flow of blood is put into warm water mostly in winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And phlebotomy of this vein is beneficial for all veins, since there is not beneath it a pulsating vein, nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the right hand vein is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that you bind the arm with a string or your hand, after you have inserted it in warm water until the vein becomes inflated and is demonstrated to sensation strongly.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then let the blood flow across by being cut.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in anything.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful, lest you injure your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For beneath it are bare nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow out into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it in warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein and is prohibited from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have extracted a quantity of blood as needed, then put oil and salt on the vein, so that it does not close quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly it is necessary to do with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen, and do similarly in its phlebotomy as you did in the right hand equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of phlebotomy of the saphena vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menses, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and thighs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the weak person inserts their foot into warm water, and makes a friction on it until the veins are filled, and binds above the joint of the foot with a cord.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the vein that is near the heel appears above the thumb and many branches spread from it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	I perform a venesection on it in its thicker branch or at the heel in its gathering, because it is better and healthier.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you perform a venesection on it on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it under the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your venesection where you perform it from a transverse direction, as if you wish to cut it, and let the venesection be with a needle.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If on the other hand the flow of blood is stopped, then immerse that foot in warm water, and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the one performing the venesection misses the vein at first, then repeat the venesection towards the upper parts for a little while, for the location is healthy, and you will not be harmed by it when you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the other foot's saphenous vein equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel on the wooded or forest side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the indication for venesection of it is, for pain of the hip, when it is on account of hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its venesection is, that the weak enter the bath and be bound, and let the leg be constricted on the side of the hip up to above the heel with four fingers, with a thin thread, for it does not appear except on account of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then perform venesection on it according to whatever ingenuity is possible for you, or with a transverse direction, and it is better, either to cut it with an incision, or to sever it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The location of it is a savior, and it itself is hidden in many men with strength.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	What if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the sense at all: then phlebotomize some branch of it, and it is that which appears on the back of the foot, and the one turned towards the ear: and beware of the nerves, and make to flow from the blood a quantity which you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the tightness, and put a poultice on the place of phlebotomy, and bind the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it will heal quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On Purging, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Purges are made from hORNs, and from copper, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And purging is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification, and extraction of blood: and the other is purging without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this purging which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the purges which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the purging of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the purges of Alhagdahim, and they are two sides of the neck on both sides together: and the purges of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower mouth: and the purges of the two shoulders: and the purges of Alachosos above the end of the tail: and the purges of the two elbows, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and the purges of the two thighs: and the purges of the two haunches.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And the venesection which does not extract blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that the virtue does not fall out from them, as is the case with it from bloodletting.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	And it is not necessary that venesection be administered with or without fire for any of the ailments which occur due to overfilling, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	What if necessity calls for venesection from an ailment, or because of habit, we administer it at every hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	What is it, for there is a man in whom when blood is multiplied in him to the point that he needs its extraction by venesection, he finds in his head heaviness and dizziness.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And there is one of them who finds overfilling and redness in his face, his head, and his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And there is one of them who finds itching in his face and his forehead and darkness and dimness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there is one of them who scratches the place of his venesection.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there is one of them whose laughter is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And there is one of them who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or he spits up blood from his tongue, and spews out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there is one of them whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there is one of them who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and wounds, and blows, and things that are similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something of those things, and it is specifically during the third quarter of the month: we prescribe then that venesection be done, after two or three hours have passed from the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The indication of venesection of the neck is: because it helps against heaviness in the head, and what flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	And it is necessary, that it be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is a substitute for the place of bloodletting on the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted that it be used by one who is of a cold complexion or in whom there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it does great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that it is not fitting that the old use it, and in whose head there are cold diseases.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	He who is excessive on it, generates upon himself forgetfulness.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that it is necessary that you instruct the one performing the enema, to put his hand with the enema for a little while at the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Enema or Alkehel is in the place of bloodletting of the dark vein and the royal vein, and because of that it alleviates asthma, and constriction of the breath, and splitting of the instrument of the breath, and coughing, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the enema Alkehel be administered for a little while, because if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The enema of the cluster, alleviates accidental pains in the head and diseases of the eyes and half headache and perforation and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in the place of royal bloodletting.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the one performing the enema, not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The enema under the chin alleviates ulcers in the mouth and corruption of the gum and similar things from diseases which are in the mouth: and it stands in the place of bloodletting of the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The enema of the spatula alleviates to relaxation, which is caused by retention and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The interior dissection of the two parts of the inner ventosation constricts the juice of the phlebotomy of the three veins, the Basilica, the Fusca, and the Cephalica: because it itself draws blood from all those tiny veins that are in the flesh: and those tiny veins draw from other thicker veins, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Ventosator not to proceed too far in the scarification, because the area is bare of flesh and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The ventosa that is ventosed on the alchausos constricts the hemorrhoids of the anus and the lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Ventosator, that the ventosa should be large and made of copper: because the area requires strong suction, and perhaps delicate ventosas would break: and let the scarification be made with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The ventosas of the legs diminish with a clear decrease: because they draw blood from the whole body, and relieve ancient pains in the kidneys, bladder, and uterus: they provoke menstruation, and relieve bothor and amenorrhea: and they take the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and the alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they greatly weaken the body, and cause syncope to occur in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of the alhorcobeni ventosas is similar to the benefit of the ventosas of the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the positioning of the ventosas is that you should place a ventosa in a vacuum at first, and apply suction with tempered pressure: and do not prolong the positioning of the ventosas, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place of equal arrival: and do not cease to repeat this and continue it, until you see the area already red and inflamed, and the appearance of a blood rash: then scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of tender flesh among men, of rare pores, it is necessary to make an incision once, no more, so that the location is not ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the one who performs the operation to enlarge the incision and make it a little deeper, and to moderate the suction with ease, speed, and his own movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	What if there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to make an incision twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance, the way is opened for the subtlety of the blood and its thinness, and in the second instance, for the scrutiny of the exquisite extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is very foul indeed, then let a third incision be made, so that it attains the ultimate.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And in the end, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little at a time, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	What if we wish for multiple extractions of blood, we make multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make a deep incision, and the limit of equality in the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is it that should be administered from oils for the positioning of the cupping glasses, and what the one who applies the cups should beware.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case, for one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are constricted, it is necessary to anoint the locations of cupping with opened, gentle, resolving oils: if it is in summer, such as oil of alkiri, or oil of violet, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or sarsaparilla, and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the ulcer is gross and cold, then let the oil be myrtle or balm oil or almond oil or pine oil, and similar to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the ulcer is of open sores, of tender flesh: then it is necessary to prohibit oil, and it is necessary that these sores be washed after application with rose water, or cold water, or solvent water, or gourd water, or purslane water: and similar to these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of much humidity, should wash the sores with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumach: and similar to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whose ulcers are gross, should wash their sores with old wine, or with water of senna, or a decoction of catmint, or chamomile: and similar to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the application be applied in a bath, or in a heated room of a bath, and it is necessary that it be administered after exiting the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that someone sleep after the application.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that should be regulated for a person with an ulcer, or one who will be bled, before the application.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that it is necessary to consider first: then if the person with an ulcer, or one who will be bled, is bilious, and there are acute and inflamed blood: then it is necessary that he take cooling things, such as cold granules: and also an enema with vinegar and lettuce, and wormwood, and buckthorn: and similar to these.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And let his foods be gentle, and the flesh of boiled sheep, and seasoned dishes with verjuice: and similar to these.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And he whose complexion is cold, should take in a drink syrup of honey, or of almond, or wormwood made from seeds: and take fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and it is prescribed that he use a small amount of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put its food, which is cane sugar, and pease, that is, small peas, and the flesh of pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is suitable, that the drink of venesection and bloodletting should be more than food: and it is suitable, that there should be given in a drink to certain men in hours of tyriaca alfaroch, or medicine of musk, that is, muscat, or alesselite before venesection, and before bloodletting, or after: so that the principal members are comforted, and the blood is thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not suitable, that they should take it in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Of Venesection without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Venesections without scarification are those that are applied to the liver, and spleen, and gout, and to the abdomen, navel, and kidney area, and armpit: because these members do not suffer scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through them, unless there is an attraction of blood from one member to another member: as we apply Venesection to the breasts in illness of flow of nasal blood.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them, to release from the member a cold and congealed venesection in the member: as we apply venesection to the abdomen, and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes pain for that reason, because it resolves that venesection.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	And it is also applied to the kidneys, when there occurs in them a stoppage or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by the virtue of its attraction, it perhaps opens up the blockage, or eradicates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it does similarly when it is applied to the liver and spleen for a third venesection in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these ventoses are administered with a poultice for so long as there is a wound.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And they are administered full of warm water for illnesses of the pleura and that is so that the ventose is filled and it is large with hot water alone or with water in which have been decocted herbs which are suitable.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of a ventosa administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	The width of its opening is two fingers wide, according to what we have formed: and its quantity in depth is half a palm: and there is on its side in the place which is around the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity that an needle enters it: let it be made from bronze or citrine, with thick edges, smooth, equal, polished: so that it does not harm the member at its position above it: and let there be in its middle a transverse rod of bronze or iron, where a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this large ventosa is made, larger than the one we described, and a little smaller than that one, according to the illnesses and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the ventoses of children, and of thin people are different, than the ventoses of men, and of those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this ventosa with fire on the member, is that you light a flax with fire from a linen thread, or a small candle made of tallow: and place it above the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the ventosa: so that the fire is lit around the lower part of the ventosa, so that the body of the infirm person does not get burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then let it be placed on the member: and a finger is on the hole which I mentioned, until when we hold the ventosa: while we press, we remove the finger, and vapor will go out above that hole, and the ventosa will come loose at once.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then apply a second dressing to it according to its size, and change it, if you need to.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the case of a poultice that is administered for a sickness of the pleura with water, there is no rod across, nor an opening: and it is not administered unless to fill with water, and is placed on the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger this poultice is, so that it can hold a lot of water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the suspension of bloodletting.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodletting is not administered to many, unless in those members in which it is not possible to apply poultices, because of their smallness, such as the lip and the gums, and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a member bare of flesh, such as the finger and the nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that they should be veins from bloodlettings which are in sweet waters, clean from rottenness.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be left for a day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be treated first with bloodletting, and with poultices.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wipe the weak member until it becomes red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards, something is placed on it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they fill and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with a poultice, then it is almost the last in treatment: and if not, then wipe the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and rub, and squeeze out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	What if the flow of blood is prolonged after the operation of bloodletting, and it is that which flows back: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and put it on top, until the flowing back is stopped.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if the blood is multiplied, then powderize over it astringent powders, or gall, and similar things from styptics: until the blood is wiped away.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or let half roasted broad beans be placed over the place and left until they stick to the spot, for the blood is wiped away.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if iteration of bloodletting is required, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If the bloodlettings are prohibited from suspension, then let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or apply a fig or a needle to the places, until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they should be placed, for as soon as they feel something from the blood, they stick at once.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish that they fall, powderize over them something from ground aloes, or salt, or ashes: and they will fall at once.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on restoration and dislocation, and cure of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also many times necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures, and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, that the foolish medical men and the common people who have not inspected any ancient book, nor read a letter from it, throw themselves at this chapter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it happens that this method is deprived of the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have not found in it anything good at all, and I have not acquired from it that which I have acquired except because of the length of reading ancient books, and study over the understanding of them, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then to adhere to experimentation and study for the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from that in this Chapter all that my knowledge contains; and on which my experimentation was based, after I had shortened it for you, and freed it from the occupation of length, and shortened it by means of abbreviation, and showed it by means of declension: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declension, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In summary, and collections from the being of fractures of bones, from those in which a previous presentation is necessary, before we begin the remembrance of broken members, and divers, if of each.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is fitting that we say in the prologue of this Chapter, the sum of the discourse, and chapters, for whose understanding the artisan is first compelled to station himself upon their truth: namely so that you, and those who are prompt, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or fall happens to someone, then it is fitting that you should first hasten to phlebotomize him, and to solve it, or both at the same time: if nothing prohibits it, such as weakness of strength: or if he to whom it happened is a boy, or an old decrepit man: or if it is a time of vehement heat, or of strong cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, cold poultices, and flesh of birds, and of fish: and prohibit wine, and fat meats, and fill him with foods and every food which fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are secure from the hot abscess, and do not fear the effusion of matter to the member: then let the weak person return to his first regime with which his habit was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When a fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the food be weak and nutritious, with much nourishment, thick, heavy, in which there is viscosity, such as food made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and innards of birds, and eggs, and fresh fish: and coarse wine, and similar things to these.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the clotting of the fracture will occur more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that fractured bones, when they are in men who are in early old age and decrepit, it is not possible that they knit and consolidate according to their natural ability always, on account of the dryness of their membranes: and they do consolidate and knit which are from them at the end of leniency, such as the bones of small boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However nature does attach to the fractured bone from every part something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, with which it adheres and binds itself, until they are knit together and bound together, until it comes to an end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until something does not hinder it from its operations: and on account of this cause it is necessary that you put weak nourishing food, in which there are heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of members: for the fracture of the thigh is diverse from the fracture of the bone of the head: and the fracture of the bone of the chest is diverse from the fracture of the bone of the back: and similarly all the remaining members exist as diverse one from another: and I come with remembrance of every species of fracture exhibited in its distinct Chapter, separate from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures are also differentiated among themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because its fracture becomes bent, besides which stars are affected in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when a fracture of it occurs along the length of the bone: and its fractures are jagged, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as they are in a reed, when it is adapted to a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and it is a fracture with a wound and a disruption in the head: and it is a fracture, a small split.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every species has a device, or its own proper instrument for its restoration, according to which comes the recollection of it, distinguished in their own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that by which the fracture of the bone is recognized, is its crookedness and its own projections: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore the crookedness does not appear in its place, nor the sound at your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the weak one find great pain: then there is no fracture there, yet it is possible that there be a crookedness or a small split: therefore it is not necessary to move it with the hand and compression entirely, but rather put on top of it from the medicines, whose recollection comes after the moment that suits the place: then let the dressing be tightly bound.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that the place when it is bent and split into two, besides which stars occur in it, nevertheless every part is moved from its comparison: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to the rectification of it, equaling it before a hot apostem occurs to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however a hot apostem occurs to it, then leave it for some days, until the apostem subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equal it according to whatever method is possible from gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than of a bone, in which stars occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tie it, secondly what will help you is the recollection of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are wounds in the bone, then extension of this broken member is necessary from two parts, if it is the hand or foot: or with your hand, if the member is small: or with two cloths, or with a cloth and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be where you put the member on an equal place, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try, that you make those additions return with all ingenuity, and in any manner you can in their places: and beware according to your strength, that pain or injury does not happen to the weak part through your operation: and try according to your strength, that you apply one of the two bones with its fellow, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time, that you feel and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and equalize it according to the quantity of your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many of the foolish do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often cause a warm aposteme or contraction in the member to happen through their operation: as we have already seen that from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect afterwards equality and decent operation, and the tightening of that member, and rest, and tranquility: and warn the weak one about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware, that he not move it during his hours of watching and his sleep, and his turning, and his agitation, and at his evacuation, and all his movements with his utmost care.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he beware, lest the position of the member be a position which follows with pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain or injury in the disposition of the member's position: then it is necessary, that he changes it to another disposition from that with which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And let it heal with that, so that its position is equal and straight, so that no distortion occurs in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the stricture of a fractured member is, according to which I will narrate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured members differ in their smallness and largeness, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which therefore of them are small, such as the arm, and finger, and elbow, and things similar to them, then it is fitting that there should be a wrapping of soft cloth, fine.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which however of them are thick, such as the hip and leg, it is fitting that there should be a wrapping on them of broad, hard cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For a broad bandage connects a large member and binds it on every side with an equal constriction, so that it does not press into it a bruise.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after your reduction to put on a plaster suitable for it, in a gentle poultice over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap a bandage over the place of the fracture itself with three or four wraps, according to what the member deserves: and bind your hand for a little while with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and bind less than your constriction was, with which you bound the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the wrapping from the place of the fracture for a little while, and gradually soften the constriction, until you take away from the sound place a large thing.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another cloth, and wrap it again over the fractured place with wraps.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards go with the wrapping to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in constricting and wrapping, and softening of it, according to what we said in the first wrapping above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put among the dressings a sponge or a cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture will be straightened if there is crookedness in it and if not do not put anything on it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then dress over it another cloth.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards put equal stars of plaster made to measure immediately over these dressings, if there is not in the place an inflammation, nor a hot aposteme.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If however there is in it an inflammation or an aposteme: then put over it what will appease that aposteme and take away the inflammation: and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind over it then stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be from halves of a reed cane shaved formed wisely: or let them be from wood from which are made cribs, which are made from pine or jerid, that is, branches of palm tree, or calamus: and let the width of all star be according to this form and the same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	Truly it is necessary that the star which is put over the dressing be thicker and wider for a little while than the other stars: and the length of the star be according to what is permitted by the member from its size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the stars with another cloth, according to the first dressing, the same.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie above with threads properly, according to what we have said about the dressing: and it is that your dressing be over the place of the fracture more: and as much as it is further from the fracture, the dressing will be smaller.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be of soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the operation of stupid men who put their threads from cords of flax twisted, it is a great mistake: because the dressing falls with them beyond the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And the thin threads do not meet again because you will not achieve with them that which is desired through tightening.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not suitable for it to be less between the star and the star than a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	That which if a weak place is injured through the ends of the stars after tightening on healthy places: then put under them from lint or woolen cloth, until nothing is injured from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with a wound, and a disruption occurs in the skin, I come with the reminder of it in the second chapter according to its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken member needs to be tied with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Which is, that when a member is large, it is not suitable to put stars on it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the event of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, with which the ancients restored, which are put on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The method of a common plaster abbreviated, restoring a fracture, suiting many complexions, especially for women and children: because it is from that on which neither heat nor cold prevails.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, that you take from the powder of a mill, and it is the marrow of flour which hangs on the walls of a mill at the movement of the millstone: and you mix it as it is, except that you sift it with the white of an egg: and you put its confection not thick, nor subtle.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The method of another plaster, for restoring a fracture, and a dislocation, and a twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take madder, and lavender, and acacia, and elecampane, and mugwort: and juice, of each a similar amount, myrrh and aloe of each a similar amount, and of the remainder twenty: and sift all, and mix with water of the remainder: or with the white of an egg, if the complexation of the weak person is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then apply this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, quickly restores broken bones, and benefits many men.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another mode of plaster, which also benefits fractures and sprains.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugwort and mess, and white altea, of each a dram, myrrh and aloes of each half a dram, acacia six drams, Armenian bolus twenty drams, let all be rubbed down well, and crushed, and mixed with water or the whites of eggs: and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A mode of plaster for joints, and bones displaced from their places: and it calms the accidental pain to them, and the cutting of bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Let linen cloth be soaked and submerged in vinegar and decocted oil: and applied to the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And this plaster has not the virtue of restoration, but is good for soothing a hot abscess: and it properly expels pains.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A mode of plaster, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of the fig tree and the leaves of the wild papaver: and rub all together, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A mode of short plaster, administered for the restoration of a fractured bone: and when you wish to resolve the remainder of an abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of marsh marigold, and chamomile, and the flowers of violet, and the flour of the herb, all of one part: let all be rubbed and mixed with wine, if the member is not inflamed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the member is indeed inflamed, then mix it with water of moist coriander, or with water, and apply it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A mode of another stronger plaster for resolution, than this first one, when there occurs a hard abscess during the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe of the root of altea, and seed of linum, and balaustium, and mellilot, and samsuch, and flower of uiolarum, and camomilla, all alike, a single part, let all be mixed, and let them be made with water of willow, or with fresh water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All that according to the warmth of the member, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a broken member for its restoration, except a cerate made from wax and oil: none other: and he described it as being a mean between thickness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	To Galen indeed it seemed, that things which have an exciting of heat should be placed on a broken member for its restoration, such as myrrh, and aloe, and olibanum, and similar to these from those which we described.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of an emplaster that is applied for a lesion and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugath, and cicer, and cut human hair, or bird's wing, and altea, and salt in equal parts: let them be ground, and sifted, and made: and let an emplaster be made from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, however, according to which it is proper that the dressing remains, and then is dissolved, is such that you should consider at that time, if no pain happens to the infirm, nor itching, nor the broken bone moves from its place: then you do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens to him in the place a vehement itching, or an annoying pain, or inflammation: then dissolve it immediately, and remove the emplaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a soft marine sponge, humid: and submerge it in tepid water, and wash the place with it, until the itching is quieted, and the pain is assuaged.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then leave the limb to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put on it a piece of cloth soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for one night, until you are secure from the hot aposteme, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the subtle dressing and a small plaster, and do not bind it with your first constriction, but bind it subtly, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	Which if you see that the aposteme, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all the accidents have been removed entirely, then repeat the plaster and dressing as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	Which if none of the things we have spoken of happen to the limb, then do not unravel it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is left for twenty days, all that which appears to you from the solution of the limb, as we have said, until when the fracture adheres, and the coagulation of the flesh approaches over it: then also add to the dressing more than your entire first dressing: and also add in the thickening of the weak plaster, according to what the remembrance of it has preceded.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If however you see the place of the fracture already becoming dry and thinner than it should be: then know that nourishment is prohibited from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Moisten it therefore with warm water at every place where you unravel it, and let it be for three days, and alleviate the dressing a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation therefore nourishment runs to the limb, and it is healed quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	What foolish restorers do from a fracture of the limb, instead of other things, when it is not restored at first as it ought to be, and is restored according to twisting, is an error of their operation and great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said it in their books, and would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen any trace of them in all that, and it is better that it does not happen.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the making of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fractures are diverse, and its figures are many: and the causes of it are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture which occurs from a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the bone as far as it reaches to the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axe does in wood: and on account of that this species of fracture is named Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword strikes a part of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the cut does not penetrate to the end of it: and this species of fracture is called Kalan, that is, Absolute Removal.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture which is a crushing or an attrition: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which approaches the periosteum, which is beneath the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and there is a wound of these two fractures also, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone to the thinness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and on account of that this species of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And there is a fracture which occurs from a fall or a blow of a stone, and similar things, which cause the lamina of the bone to enter inward, and a concavity is made in its place: just as it happens to cauldrons of copper, when a blow occurs to them, and a part of them enters inward.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And that often happens in the heads of humid bones, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And there are for all these species of fractures separated dislocations, and I apply a vein with recollection of that entire thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these species of fracture by detection on them, and inquiry of them with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species of hairline fracture is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, and wiped, and anointed on it with a plaster: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the cure of a fracture, consider first the accidents of weakness: then if you see from the accidents what signifies a manifest sign of fear, such as vomiting of bile, and stretching, and loss of intellect, and cutting off of voice, and fainting, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar things to these from accidents in many dispositions, without doubt it will not be cured: and if you see accidents not terrifying you, and you hope for health: then begin the cure of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What is, if the wounded comes to you immediately after being wounded: and it is in winter days, then it is necessary that you should strive for removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in summer days, then it is necessary that you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it becomes corrupted what is under the bone from the pad, and those accidents occur which we have narrated.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	What if the fracture of the bone has already come to the pannicle touching the brain, and it is with bruising, and attraction: then it is necessary that you should cut the part that is bruised and attracted, according to what I relate to you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, that you shave the head of the wounded: and you detect on the bone according to whatever mode is possible for you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is least burdensome over the weak part.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	What if it happens to you upon detection of a bone with a flow of blood, or a hot abscess: then apply to it what is appropriate.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and you make the wound rest, until the abscess has settled, and you are secure from a flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the cure of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that will be done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is, that you cut the bone with a strict incising instrument: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another incising instrument wider than the previous one for a little while: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer also another incising instrument even wider also than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is, that you have a number of diverse incising instruments: some of which are wider than others, and some of them shorter than others: and let them be sharpened to the end of their extremities, and let them be made from iron or steel: and use facility in striking on the incising instrument, so that it does not strike the head, and wound it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary that you perforate around it, before you administer the incising instruments, with Awls which are called non-penetrating Awls: and they are not so called unless because they themselves do not penetrate to the end of the fleshy bone beyond what is behind it: on account of that an Awl has a round extremity above what is under its sharp head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents sinking and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to receive from these Awls a large number, each of which fits the quantity of thickness of the bone, until there is present to you an Awl for every cranium: whose sharp extremity in length and width is according to the quantity of thickness of that cranium.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the shape of three types of trephines, or chisels.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of perforating around the fractured bone is: that you put the trephine on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the trephine to another place and put what is around every hole the quantity of the thickness of the radius, or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors what is around every hole in the bone: and make it thinner than you can on that side of fineness, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, either with your hand or with some other one of the instruments which you have prepared for it: such as small files and subtle forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you proceed with every caution, lest the trephine or incisor touch anything of the brain.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have gone around the bone perforating, and it has been separated from the brain, if it was continuous with it, and you extract it, it is necessary that you scrape, and equal the extremity of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	Truly, it is necessary that it be thin and more subtle than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	What remains of the small bones, and the fragments: then take them with ease, with that which is with you of instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then cure the wound after that with bandages and ointments which we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And the method of another operation is easy, far from fear: which Galen said, and praised it with great praise: and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin to detect the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most vehement and most manifest: until when you have detected that part, and you have placed under it the extremity of this incisor, which has this shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-like part, nothing of the lens is cut away: and its pointed part on both sides presses in length, as you see: so that the lens-like part rests against the cataract, with its pointed surface pressing into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike above the incisor on one side with a small hammer, until you cut through the whole bone with ease, as it becomes visible: and you will be safe from the cloth, which does not happen to it by chance, what you fear will happen.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not more stupid than men, and more ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it away from it with the tip of the lens-like incisor, and would free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the cloth, and what is cut away from the bone is its surface, and remaining in it are roughness and subtle projections: then it is necessary that you scrape away that roughness, and remove those projections with subtle rasps which you have prepared in different quantities, so that it is possible for you to administer from them in every place the most suitable and straightest of them, according to what the operation leads you to, and the bone itself, broken, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your scraping, which you use to scrape the bone first, wider than those of the other scrapers.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it a still finer one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not stop doing that according to continuity, until you reach administering the thinnest and subtlest of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small fissures and subtle fractures, it is necessary that you administer care, according to what leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing which is not hidden from everyone, to whom in this art there is whatever study, and it stands upon that which we have written, and we show in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If indeed the flap is detected and retained, when you extract the bone: then it is necessary, that you take a linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and put it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth doubled or tripled, and submerge it in wine and rose oil, and put it over the first cloth: and make that as easily as you can over that, so that it does not press on the spleen.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer over it a broad ligament: and do not bind it, except by the quantity that the wound holds so much: and leave it with this care for one day, or two days, until you are secure from a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then undo it, and administer after that medicines with which there is excessive dryness: such as the roots of lily, and flour of herb, and powder of frankincense, and aristolochia, and similar to them: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the wound as are the dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer to it every medicine of the property of which is that it cleanses and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your virtue, that the wound in your cure is clear: and is not in it filth of ointment, nor foulness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not allow pus to gather in it at all: for when pus gathers on the brain's flap, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and great evil befalls the weak after that: and now it befalls the spleen of the head, when the bone is cleaned by it, especially when the care of it is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider then, if weaknesses that we have mentioned befall, you should know what is harmful without doubt.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackening does not occur, except from the medicine that is placed upon it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine, that it causes that blackening: then you should take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and bind them with a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the wound: afterwards treat it with species of cure that are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You should know that the nose does not break except in its two upper parts at the same time, or one of them: because it itself has two bones: since the lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break, and there happens to it only attrition, and twistedness, and curvature.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts breaks, then you should put a small finger into the nasal passage, and straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and this is done with skill.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest pain occurs during your operation on the weak area.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	What if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it: then you should straighten it with the end of a rod, on which there is a small knob.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed the fracture is in both parts, then do similarly to it: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, during the rest of a warm poultice.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a bandage from linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two bandages if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be in the bandage a thickness of such quantity that it fills the nasal passage.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And certain of the ancient restorers said that they should pour the linctuses into butter and change them every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That indeed does not seem to me, but rather it is necessary, that a linctus be poured into the whites of eggs, mixed with powder of toasted wheat.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then apply the linctus until the bone becomes firm and the cartilage becomes hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when a linctus is introduced into the nostril, a feather of a goose is placed in its stead, after which a soft cloth is wrapped over it: and this is done so that it may strongly hold the fracture of the nose, and so that the weak one is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not a necessary thing.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want, do that: and if you want, make linctuses.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	Which if it happens to the nose again while you are operating with a hot apostume, plaster the nose with cerate, or with a plaster infused in rose oil, or with a little of diacalendine.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If however the hot apostume does not happen, then it is necessary that you plaster it with flour of fava and powder of frankincense mixed with the whites of eggs.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put a soft swab over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture, or are crushed, then it is necessary that you cut above them and extract them with instruments which are suited to them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew up the wound, and cure it with that which brings flesh and consolidates from plasters suited to it, or from ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	Which if a wound happens to the nose, then it is necessary that you cure it with linctuses: and administer a pipe of lead, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Of the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken apart.
Caput V.	Chapter Five
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is dislocated and its fracture is not with a wound, consider then if its fracture is only a defect and does not break into two, and curves inward, then its treatment is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary therefore, if the fracture is in the right part, that you insert the index finger of the left hand into the mouth of the weak person, similarly if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand, and push with it the curvature of the fracture from within with ease to the exterior with your other hand from the interior part of the bone, and straighten it with that.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	What if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from both parts, according to straightness, until its equality is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If indeed a shaking or disruption has already occurred in the teeth, then tie them with a thread of gold, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put a plaster on the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over it a double-folded cloth, and put over the cloth a large strap made from the center, or a piece of leather sole, equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it from above, according to what the dressing of it prepares for you, and its application is suitable, until it is not destroyed: and order the weak person to rest and quiet: and give its food gentle sips.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If indeed you think that something of the figure has already changed in some way, then hasten and release it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from it, and apply a plaster made from flour of wheat, with the white of egg, or with flour of barley, after you have removed the plaster: and put over the plaster a gentle wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	Therefore let that plaster remain over it and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not disturb it, until it heals: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is bound many times in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	What if meanwhile a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its treatment, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For now a fragment is separated from the bone, or by sawing: then be subtle in this, that you remove those fragments of sawing with what suits you in the removal of them from instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the quantity of your necessity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those sawings, and none of them remain, or then the opening of the wound, if it is wide: and if not, put over it from plasters that suit for that, and flesh will grow on it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the Jaw, when it is fractured.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The Jaw is indeed fractured most often from the front part of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For it is broken and separated into two, besides which occur in that sawing: and it is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or it occurs with a bone sawing: and it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when the fracture is without a wound, is that you make two attendants be present, so that one of them holds the aid that follows the fractured Jaw, and the other stretches the neck towards the opposite side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then you should reduce the fracture with your fingers until its shape is restored, according to what is suitable, and it should not be prominent or sunken.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	What you squeeze in excess by extension, then it is suitable that you place under the bandage a sphere of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to the quantity of your need: and extend and elevate the splint, and bind the sphere with your hand, until it is equal to the fracture, according to what is suitable.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	What if you cannot draw the extremity of the splint to the outside: because it penetrates to the depth: then it is suitable that the weak one should rest upon his neck: and you place under his shoulder a middle-sized pillow, and your servant presses his shoulder downwards, until the bone of the splint which is in the depth rises upwards: and then you straighten the fracture, and reduce it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a false movement from the splint, and it moves: then it is suitable that you bind above it, and extract the same false movement with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then make an incision of it with one of the incisors that you have prepared for that purpose, after you have placed under the splint a tool that holds the flesh: and this tool is made of wood or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It becomes similar to an ear which does not have a hollow.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to that which you judge suitable for it from the size of the bone and its thinness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two extremities, as you see: and one extremity should be broad, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the disruption of the wound which you cut when you extracted the false movement of the bone is broad, and you are concerned about a hot abscess: then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or a hot abscess forms: then fill the wound with cotton pads, and poultices according to the quantity of the discharge of the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	What if a hot abscess forms, then soak a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it over the top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	Inflammation of a bone when it is without a wound, and without a cut, is treated by applying to the bone a plaster made from milled flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put a linen dressing on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then apply a ball under the nipple, if you suspect it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a hemiatem, that is, a rod which the Saracens hold, which should be long and of the width of one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a double poultice on top of the dressing and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a little rod from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the rod in place of the hemiatem, which falls on the fracture and the location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then put the hemiatem on the fracture as it is wrapped, and wrap it around the neck, and under the healthy nipple, and under the weak nipple: and bind it all over, and however you see that the bandage holds the fracture in place decently: and it is such that it should not be hidden from you, and altogether, so that the rod does not move off the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, it is necessary to look at the weak side every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	As often as the bandage becomes loosened, and you see the rod already moving: then straighten it, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put the bandage of the weak person on his back, and put under his armpit near his bandage a small pillow at night, so that with it the aid of it may be elevated from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the shoulder is elevated therefore through elevation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie his arm to his neck: and do not untie the bandage, unless an accident occurs from itching, or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see the surface of it towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the tightening, and leave it, until it is restored and knit together.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the shoulder is tightened and comforted according to the most part in twenty days: and sometimes it happens in certain men in less than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of the fracture of the Shoulder blade.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The shoulder blade is rarely broken, and in the wide place of it: and they are not broken from it except its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore the place is broken from it, and it breaks in the middle of it, and it is not recognized except by touch: then according to what is the figure of the fracture, prepare its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural figure in every way of skill, that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on the place powder of rose with egg white, and a soft cloth, and put over it a small pillow from folded cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on it a broad strap from thin wood according to the quantity of the whole shoulder blade, or a little more than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed under the strap there is a hollow in some place of the shoulder blade, then equal that hollow with a soft cloth, until the strap descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then with the thread from above with a long needle and moderate constriction and firmness of the star, so that it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament in every direction.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	As often as the ligament is softened, tighten it with a thread, and equal to the star if it is removed from its place: and let the weak one lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And a spatula of some sort is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore the number is completed, then untie the ligament: and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is one of the bones whose fracture is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If a piece proceeds from the bone and pierces under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the furcula from the sediment of a hot aposteme, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the Breast.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast is rarely fractured in its middle, and that rarely happens to it.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities are most often fractured and broken from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is fractured, which declines to the lower parts, and there happens to it a severe pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps it vomits blood, and it is declared that there is a fracture in the bone, and it is not hidden from sensation, The restoration of it is, so that the weak one lies on his back: and put between his Spatulas a pillow.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and gather the ribs from both sides or the sides with the hands: and adjust in its equality, according to every mode that is possible for it and is convenient, until the figure of the bone returns, according to what is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put on top of it a plaster and a dressing, and put above it a splint made from a thin board of willow or hazel, and similar things for lightness, after you have wrapped it in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then bind it tightly around the fractured bone, so that it is not moved: and take care with the bandage according to the roundness of the back, and tighten it with a suitable strap.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage every hour, and as often as it becomes loose, tighten it: and if necessity demands its removal on account of itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and remove it, and scrape away the plaster, and correct what happens with the method of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then put back the plaster, if you see it is beneficial for that face: and apply a bandage to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of the ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur, except in thick places which follow the back, and from the ends of them on the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And damage does not happen to them, except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from feeling on examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way, that you straighten the fracture with your fingers according to what is possible, until it takes on the shape, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply a plaster, and bind the fractured bone with a splint, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined to the inside: then there happens to the patient a severe pain and puncture, like the puncture that happens to one who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also there happens to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And already the ancients have devised in it with many devices: and among them are those who say, that you should apply foods to the weak which generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly may be inflamed, and distended, and the fracture driven outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed disapprove, that it not become a quick cause for making a hot abscess, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it has already happened, then he adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them have said: let something be placed on the windy place, then let it be sucked with strength, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Truly however it is feared, that the windiness may attract superfluities to the place, on account of the disposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them have said: it is fitting that the place be covered with wool which has already been soaked in hot oil: and little cotton balls shall be placed between the ribs, until it is full: so that there may be an even bandage when you wrap it around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then let the weak person be treated with a treatment for pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	That if the constraining thing harms the weak person, which it does not tolerate, and the mouth is pierced by a sharp pointed instrument, and we fear for the weak person: then it is necessary, that we cut above the place, and uncover the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us put on it an instrument that preserves the health, whose reputation has preceded: and let us cut the mouth with ease, and let us cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and let us treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	That if a hot abscess happens meanwhile, then apply quickly, and pour in cotton balls soaked in rose oil, and put on the place: and let the weak person be treated with what is suitable for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, it should also be bandaged over the side on which he sleeps, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter Ten.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	When a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and it rarely happens to them with a bruise, and similarly for the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When then this happens to someone, and you want to know, whether it will heal or not, consider this.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already having become soft and numb and dead, and he cannot move them or stretch them or clench them, and when you clench them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it and does not feel pain in them, then know that it will not heal, and in most cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them and feels the constriction with the fingers and the puncture in them, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe, and that the weak man will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if it happens to the vertebrae of the back in a similar way, and you want to know whether it will be healed or not, then consider his feet, then if you see that they are softened and it happens to them what happened to the hands, and when he lies on his back, gas and flatulence come out without his will, and when he is turned onto his stomach, vomiting comes out without his will, and when he is turned onto his back and wants to urinate and cannot, then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Do not then labor in its cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing of that has happened to him, the matter is easier.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what has happened to him is to prepare a warm poultice of the extract: so that you put on the affected vertebra rose oil alone, or with cooked egg yolks.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place over it that same thing several times a day, until when the hot aposteme is seated: then place over the spot one of the comforting, drying, and constricting plasters, and tie it over with a ligature: and instruct the infirm to use quiet and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the side on which he feels pain, until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	What if it happens with the friction of a rough bone, or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary to cut over the skin, and to remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some incarnation, from ointments, until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the last part of the bone of the hyoid breaks, and is at the end of the tail: then it is necessary that you insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and straighten the broken bone with the other hand, according to what is possible, and a secondary adjustment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put over it, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment that preceded, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the restoration of the Ankle.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the ankle are rarely fractured.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	What if they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not, unless it is a crushing in their extremities: and they split along the length, and bend inwardly: and there happens to the infirm a pain in the place, and a puncture: and the leg which is fractured becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is, that you extend your hand over it, until you stand on the fracture in whatever way is its figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	What if the fracture is only in its extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the straightening, until it is made similar to its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If the fracture is longitudinal, or it has already begun to displace inwardly: then make the weak part lie on its abdomen, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made it even, put a plaster on it: then put on it a splint of wood or of leather: and bind it tightly with a bandage which you do not fear to move the fracture, nor remove the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And make the concavity of those parts equal with what fills it, until the bandage takes it according to equality: and order the weak person, to sleep on its back, or on its healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If a hot abscess happens to it: then cease from the extension of it, and its restoration, until the hot abscess has settled: and put on it what settles it, according to what has preceded, then return to its restoration: and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If indeed an incision occurs in the fractured bone, or it becomes comminuted, extract.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the restoration of the fracture of helpers.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	A helper is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder blade.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a wooden board of moderate thickness, according to the shape that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two bands are bound on the two extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from a raised place: and the weak person sits on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches to its elbow, on which the middle of the wood is attached the curvature.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend from above something heavy, so that it extends it downwards to the assistant.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor adjusts the fracture with his hands at the same time until the fracture returns to its place according to what is suitable.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the weak one is placed on his own neck and his hand is suspended from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants, one of them to hold what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other to hold below it, and each of them to pull to his own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if force is needed, so that the extension is stronger, then bind below the fracture with a bandage and above it with another bandage: and each of the two assistants pulls to his own two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a bandage be placed above that place and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then adjust the fracture with ease without effort, until when the fracture is adjusted according to what is necessary, and a good application is applied: then bind it, if not a hot abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed a hot abscess occurs, then loosen the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put on it a piece of wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess subsides: then bind it: and the method of binding it is that you put a plaster on the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put a dressing made from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then bring the arm up to the shoulder itself, and put his open hand on his own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put on a cloth, and bind it around the arm at the shoulder, so that the arm stands in its place, if nothing prevents you from doing so, nor is anything altered by you concerning the fractured bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	What if something is altered on top of you from a broken bone, then use an astellis: and it is, that you put on the fracture itself an astellis which is wider and stronger than other astellis.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And you put between the entire width of an astellis a finger's breadth, and let the length of the astellis be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from each side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the astellis a bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your bandage be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture stretches, the tighter the bandage should be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If you see the astellis and the bandage as we have said, at the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do it: and if you apply a warm poultice, then remove the bandage and the astellis until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the bandage for all three days, so that there does not occur at the spot itching, or swelling, or is prevented the reaching of food to the limb, on account of the constriction from the excess of the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct the whole thing accordingly as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If you are above confidence, that nothing happens from it: then do not loosen the bandage, unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the weak person sleep on their back, and their hands on their stomach: and put under for support a mattress full of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider every hour of the night or day, that the shape of the broken limb is not disarranged, nor the bandage loosened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct the whole thing with your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give food to the weak person according to the order which we previously mentioned, so that it is subtle food at first, until the mouth begins to close: then it is necessary, that you thicken their food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is customary for the aid of the thigh to be bound for forty days, then it is necessary that it be loosened and a bath administered and medicine applied with ointments which rectify it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul or bruised, then you should not loosen the bandage from it and keep it on for fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forked bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small, and it is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is the one that is placed under the small one from the lower side.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps then the larger forked bone alone will break, or the smaller one, and perhaps they will both break together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the upper small forked bone breaks, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower forked bone breaks, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that breaks is the upper small forked bone, then it is fitting for the doctor in its restoration to apply a small extension with ease until it becomes equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the large forked bone is the one that is broken, then it is necessary to apply a stronger bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to shape the hand for its restoration and to extend its extension on a pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers, and let the joint be lower than all the fingers or the rest, and let the weak one sit square on himself, and let the pillow be before him, or in his direction, in height, so that the weak one does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the assistant should extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant should extend it similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should adjust the bone until he reduces it to the best shape that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	What if there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then try to reduce every fragment into its place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed a separated splinter appears in it, and it punctures the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration: then sew over it, and remove it according to the method which we mentioned in the things that were previously said.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a special chapter about that, so take the treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	What if a hot abscess happens at the beginning of your restoration, then cover it with a cloth made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be a medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a subtle bandage, until when the abscess settles: then remove the wax, and put on an prepared plaster made from powdered flour with egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on splints, and let the splint that is put over the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most arrangements: whether the fracture is in one forearm or in two forearms at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put your bandage over the place of the fracture stronger and more violent, and a little more with the bandage to the upper or lower parts of the fracture: or put on a softer bandage for a while, according to what was previously remembered at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture be gentle cloths, moist: and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread by which it is tightened from linen properly, middle between subtle and coarse, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	What if something happens whose correction is necessary, such as an itch which happens to a member: then it is proper, that you bathe the member with warm water, until that itch quiets, and release the member not constricted, until it quiets, then repeat the constriction.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	What if the constriction is already softened, and the wound already healed, and things similar to these: then correct that entirely with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prohibited from reaching the member, on account of the excess of constriction, then it is proper, that you soften it for a while, and release it for some days, until nourishment runs to it, then constrict it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If however nothing happens to the weak one of those things which we have spoken, then it is not proper, that it be loosed, unless after twenty days, or around these.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the hand of the weak one be suspended at its neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let its neck be equal, and let it be guarded by its strength from agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make it sleep on its back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of that is according to the dispositions of complexions, and the dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Of the restoration of fractures of the Hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture rarely happens to the breast of the hand and the joints of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to them, unless from repeated pulling.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture or pulling happens to the sole, then it is proper that the weak one sits squarely: and in front of him let there be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on the extended one.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant extends the broken bones, and the physician reduces them, until they are joined with a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is suitable to apply a plaster and a dressing, if not a hot abscess occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a bandage over it according to the size of the place, and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is near the bottom around the sole of the foot, then make something like a sphere from cloth, and order the patient to press on it with his fractured sole, then it should be tightened with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the bandage be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the foot, and it should be tightened according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary to place a bandage over it, and another bandage underneath on the sole, and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then apply a binding, as the hand turns, and extend between the toes with a ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	What if a fracture occurs to one of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be reduced according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then let it be tightened with the sole, and if you love him, place a straight small bandage on it, so that the fracture may be elevated and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then let it be reduced, and bound with the healthy finger that follows it, or let all be bound together in a row, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small bandage over it, as we have said regarding the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider your restoration, and after the arrangement of a hot abscess, and oppose with what is necessary, when something happens from it, according to which the account of it is repeated.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the restoration of a fracture of the hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often fractured and this is revealed by sensation, because it turns to the inner and back part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in such a way that one ligament is tied above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And a splint is applied over its surface.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then every ministering ligament extends to its own part according to equality: and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let the ligament be on the side of the chest, so that the extension falls upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician makes the bone equal with both his hands, until he reduces it according to the similarity of its natural figure: and the bone is joined with a good conjunction.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is fitting that you apply a plaster and a bandage, if an abscess does not occur on the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	For if it happens that an abscess occurs on it: then leave it for some days, until the hot abscess settles, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	And the bandage of it should be thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is fitting that you wrap around the fracture a hard binding, that is, a bandage: and fold it twice or three times: and let excess remain from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come out from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then scrape off what is excessive from the hip and the thigh from the aliment.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put on the hip in place of the fracture itself a plaster, and put among them one plaster upon the bone of the thigh.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the vacancies between the thigh and hip with soft cloths, so that it equals the bandage.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle above the place of the fracture, three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you stretch with a bandage away from the place of the fracture, the less and softer and more gentle should be your bandage.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then tie to both extremities a string, which you have inserted between the hip and thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie therefore with each of them three plasters that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then tie with the two extremities of the string downwards until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with each also tie the extremities of the plasters from the other part, so that the bandage is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the bandage upon it, while it remains, so that there does not occur to the limb corrosion, nor aposteme, nor inflammation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	What if anything of that should happen.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Treat it therefore with a solution for it, and correct what has happened from that entirely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed in the bone there is a fragment of bone which causes pain: then it is necessary that you should reduce it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, bind over it, and remove that, and treat with what was mentioned previously, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is bandaged, besides what plasters are added to it, as we said for the shoulder and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	In the restoration of such a fracture no feeble limping occurs.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, apart from applying the other leg to it, then it is necessary that he whose it is, always limps.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is constricted in fifty days, or a little added or diminished: all that is according to the diversity of complexions and the rest of the dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap of the knee.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the kneecap of the knee rarely suffers a fracture, but it often suffers an injury.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a fracture occurs to it, then it is not except for a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And the whole thing stands on that with feeling.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that what has been disrupted from its parts is adjusted with the fingers, until it aggregates and is joined according to what is possible from equality and facility, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster made from flour of fennel, or millet, with the white of an egg: and place on top of it a round bandage, if you desire that: and bind above a tight dressing fitting to it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have narrated in the other fractures: such as a warm poultice and similar things: so that you oppose every accident with what is suitable to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of the fracture of the shin.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the shins are two bones, of which one is thick and is named by the name shin: and the other subtle, and is named Fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both types of fracture what happened to the two bones of the arm: and because of that the restoration of it is made, just like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones are broken at the same time, the leg becomes crooked in all its parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a bone is broken finely, the leg becomes crooked to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a bone is broken thickly, you find it below: and it is one of those things which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and straightening, and binding of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	Truly it is necessary, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having many sores: that the extension should be smaller, and your alleviation more gentle.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg there is something from the operation over the arm: and it is, when you equal the stars, and complete all your operation, then take two splints of pine wood, which is administered in the making of sandals, which is put under the planks: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them those which have small thickness, and are not from the smallest: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each one a cloth with two wraps according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And put one part of the leg on one side, and the other part on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the bottom of the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two splints in three places, at both extremes and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when binding is prohibited, the leg declines to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now let a board of wood be administered according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be put on it, so that it may keep it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is especially necessary that you do this for a fracture when there is a wound proper to it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and examine it with utmost care for any abscess, or inflammation, or other remaining things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything happens from these, then apply to it what is appropriate, until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture does not occur in the heel itself.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot sometimes suffer a fracture, and the toes also suffer a fracture to some extent; and this does not happen to them except through injury in many instances.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture happens to the bones of the foot and you see those bones being displaced on top of each other, then let the weak one place his foot on the ground prepared, as when walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand and put your foot on what is elevated from those bones: afterwards press, or tread on it: and make it even, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put a plaster, and a dressing on top: and place under the sole of the foot a small plate, which has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with the foot a decent tightness, after which you wrap it with cloths and other things that it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three days or four have passed for it, then untie the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones even, whether they were fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore concerning these is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If some of the toes are broken, then restore them and make them even according to what I told you regarding the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put a splint on the toe according to the length of the toe, and let it be slightly wider than it: then place under the foot this plate that I told you about, and bind it with a decent tightness.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed what is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then put a splint on each toe of its own quantity, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the plate under the foot: and let it stand on one end of the plate outside the sole of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you, that you do not forget, that you consider all that I have told you regarding other fractures from accidents that we have mentioned: and oppose each accident with what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Of the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the bone of the pubis, and the rod of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is fractured, then make her sit cross-legged.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her forward towards the same back part for a little while, and let it be held from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with a cushion, until she fills it: and let it become in the vulva like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and her back be elevated little by little.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cushion comes out, until it becomes before the entrance of the vulva like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a pillow on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she wants to urinate, remove the cushion with ease, then she urinates: and reduce it according to the manner, in which you first introduced it: then let her return to her first pillow.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do that for seven days, or around, for the bone is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a bladder of a goat, and tie above its opening a reed canal, and insert the entire bladder into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the canal with force, until the bladder is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with a cushion, and let her stand for some days, according to what we have narrated, until she is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the pubis of a man or a woman is fractured, then administer in its restoration and its adjustment that which we have narrated regarding the bone of the ankle.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures which touch a little, especially to one who has something of study or usage.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book is this much, that the fracture itself signifies to you in many dispositions the right way for restoration of itself and its suture: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When a twig of a branch breaks, take the throat of a goose and insert the twig into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put on it a dressing made from cloth, and it will be dressed, and let it be for three days or around that time, and it will heal, if God wills it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of fractures of bones, when there is a wound with it.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is suitable for one to whom a fracture with a wound happens, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or the helper bone or similar to those, that you should perform bloodletting on him immediately: if the conditions of bloodletting are suitable for him, as we have mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary that you proceed to cutting it, so that you powder on it zeolite ground: if you do not have another thing at hand.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not postpone it, if there is no occurrence of an aposteme.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If a hot aposteme occurs, then leave the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the aposteme settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth day at all, for you will cause bad accidents to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the broken bone is prominent above the skin, then it is necessary that you try to reduce it, and equalize it with your hands with ease and a little extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If the extension of it and its equalization with your hands does not prepare it, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	It is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of that it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four according to the quantity which he needs for that cure in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be in it a small thickness, so that it is not doubled upon compression on it during the hour of operation: and let it be of sharp extremity, which has an edge at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be in thickness from the middle of it down to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the pointed extremity of it be placed curved over the extremity of the prominent bone: and drive it with that by one force, until when the bone returns and is equalized by a certain equalization.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Try therefore to make the extremities of the fracture equal to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	Which if the extremity of that fracture is subtle, and does not receive it with a good reception, then it is necessary to cut the extremity of that bone, until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed you cannot reduce them with what we have narrated altogether, then cut it with what is convenient for the incisions that we have said: or saw it with one of the saws in whatever mode is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape what remains in the bone from roughness and small cortexes.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and after its reduction it finds a weak intense pain, then know that the bone did not return to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer on the weak one great help, when your restoration which you do for the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then submerge the cloth in astringent vinegar, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And this is especially so in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not apply a cerate over the wound, nor anything in which there is oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer asterions at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And split the detected wound: so that you cut with a fork into the openings of the bandages according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution, lest you constrict the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many foolish physicians have done this: and they have caused to happen to their weak patients either death or corruption or ichor, that is, sanies.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your dressing be soft, gentle, a dressing diverse for the fractures and remaining things.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	For if the wound is bad, or it is a great wound, and you find certain evil accidents upon it which we have narrated, and you find pain in the suspended place: then it is not suitable to apply asterions upon it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them bandages of hard cloth in the place of asterions, and constrict it with these.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus: then remove from above it the cloth which you placed upon it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer plasters and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as the four-dragon ointment, and similar things.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the member be prepared in such a way, that pus runs out of it to the lower parts with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass over the wound and it does not consolidate, nor is the pus separated from it: then you should know that there are small pieces of bone in that place.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	It is necessary that you examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	Whatever of those small pieces of bone are separated, remove them, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them that are not separated, and pierce the membrane, and cause pain, try to cut around them, and remove them in any way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If there happens to the wound an obstruction, or a swelling, that is, an ecchymosis, or another species of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary that you oppose each one of them with what suits it from the cure, whose narration preceded in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in that which it is necessary for my speech to stand, and to which you should turn your attention when a bone is broken, and protrudes beyond the membrane, such as the hip bone, and the shoulders, and similar ones of the large members, it is that you should not attempt its traction, for many times death occurs from that, but rather leave it alone until it becomes putrid.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then cure the wound, if it seems to you, and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the cure of knotting in the healing of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This knotting often occurs during the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, which is near the joints: and it forms from that a deformed figure of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the member from its natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider then, if the knotting is recent: administer to it medicines which have astringency, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Take from these some or all and mix them with styptic wine, or with egg whites, or with vinegar: and put them on the swelling in a poultice, and bind them tightly around it with a good bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And tighten the binding, and do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another, until the swelling is reduced.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over it a plate of lead that has been hammered thin.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing all inflammation from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the swelling has already turned to stone and is constricted, and necessity urgently demands its removal: then make an incision above it on its upper part, and cut away the prominent excess: or shave it with certain scrapers, until it is removed: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On the treatment when restoration occurs, and a member remains after that in a subtle state, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of a bone is restored, and the member remains after that in a subtle, weak state: then this does not happen except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is the multitude of the solution of the ligament and its ligation not according to what is proper: or on account of the excess tightening of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from running to the member: or on account of the multitude of excessive embrocation at an improper time: or on account of the scarcity of blood in the weak body, and its debility.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment for it is to feed the weak person, and to make his body tender, until the blood is multiplied in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and gladness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put pitch on the member: so that it may attract much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And let it be constantly moistened with warm water until nourishment grows and it returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored to their twisted state.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When a member that has already been restored after its healing becomes twisted and the bone which was fractured becomes prominent or knotted, and is deformed so that the shape of the member is spoiled, yet the member is not prevented from performing its natural operation: then it is not necessary to take the advice of one who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have already been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed greatly to be censured, leading to death, or great fear, so that it is as if it were mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knot are recent, then it is necessary to moisten with warm water, in which have been decocted softening herbs, such as the leaves of marshmallow, and its root, and melilot, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made for it with a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon plaster.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let the juice of the root of marshmallow be taken and mixed with the fat of a hen or iris oil, and plastered on with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let the fat figs be taken and pounded with dove's dung and other things that are named among medicines diminishing consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is loosened with gentle, prolonged, and repeated rubbing, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the member should be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the twisting has already preceded and become strong and turned into a callus, and necessity to treat it with iron has been provoked: then it is necessary to cut above it, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and what is in excess from the knot or bone be cut away with subtle incisions: and facility should be administered in that with solicitude and study.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On speech regarding dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of any joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it is prevented from its motion, and the shape of the limb is deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes pains to occur on the weak part, and vehement injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore a dislocation occurs to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to the restoration of it, and not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes calloused, and perhaps with that the reduction of the dislocation becomes more difficult.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	On account of that, therefore it is not proper to move it, nor to extend it during the hour of its callous formation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Since it often causes spasms to occur, and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that occurs, then it is necessary that you hasten to the bloodletting of the weak part.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left until the callous formation subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then let the limb be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then let it be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And let every limb be treated with that which will bring its memory back to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, and also according to what preceded concerning fractures, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated except in part.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For they are moved from their places by slight movements and made slightly soft.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation, until they become soft towards the chest, until the saliva of the weak part runs, and it cannot hold it, nor can it close its mouth, and its tongue is involved with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation of it is small, then it returns in many dispositions by itself with paucity.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If indeed the dislocation is complete and entire: then it is necessary that the reduction of it be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and it is, that the assistant holds the head of the weak person: and the physician inserts the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the jaw of the dislocation between its mouth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts both his thumbs at the same time, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of the fingers of his hands are outside, with which he balances.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the weak person, that they cleanse their jaws, and release them for chewing to every side.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician balances the jaw, and drives the jaw, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	What if the reduction of it is difficult, especially if both jaws are at the same time: then administer a fumigation with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: nor do you delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are balanced, and the mouth of the weak person is closed, and not loosened: then put over them little cotton pads, with cerate that is made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is tied with ease with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the weak person sleep on their back: and their head be steady between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right or left: nor is it forced, or does it force itself to chew anything: but instead a gentle enema is applied to their food, until when the pains are relieved, and the jaw is knotted: then let them eat what they want, and administer it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let them not labor over the operation of their mouth with eating and drinking, and spitting, until the jaw is knotted and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	What if the reduction of two mandibles becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their place, then often fevers and constant sweating occur, and perhaps the weak belly is loosened, and perhaps pure bile is vomited.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see that, then know that it is a loss, and often he to whom that happens dies in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the elbow and the extremity of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The elbow indeed is not dislocated from the inner side, on account of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is dislocated whenever to the outer sides, and that is made clear by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, that the weak person lies on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then bind the place with your palm, with a strong binding, for it will return by itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put on it a plaster, and poultices, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities which follow the elbow and continue with it are not dislocated, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	What if it is dislocated for some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and adjusted according to what we have said, and what has been prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put on it a plaster, and poultices, and a binding.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the weak person to adhere to stillness and quiet, until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure, the extremity of the shoulder is reduced, when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder is not dislocated, except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of them is such that it becomes displaced towards the lower part of the nipple.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is such that it becomes displaced towards the part of the breast.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it becomes displaced to the upper part of the shoulder, and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not become displaced to the back, because of the blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not become displaced to the front, because of the nerve.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And most often it becomes displaced and protrudes downwards towards the nipple, especially in those whose flesh is scant.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it protrudes quickly in them and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, namely that it protrudes with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men a blow or a fall, and the shoulder becomes affected with a hot abscess, and it is thought on account of that, that it has already become displaced.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	You should therefore try it, until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the displacement is recognized when it is towards the lower part near the nipple, and you distinguish between a displaced shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find between them a clear difference, and you find at the head of the shoulder a concavity, and under the nipple upon feeling the head of the shoulder as if it were an egg, and the affected person cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it becomes displaced towards the breast or upwards, then you find a palpable feeling, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And the reduction of this displacement is easy, when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is that the assistant lifts his hand to the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your thumbs under his eyelid, and lift the joint with strength upwards to its place: and let the servant lift his hand, and stretch it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he should put it downwards, for it returns quickly by itself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however it does not return by what we have said, and there are many days since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the weak person should be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation which softens and soothes should be administered, such as if the roots of alteae, and foenugraecum, and mellilotum are decocted in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the weak person should be placed on his back: and a sphere and wool should be put under his eyelid, which is equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should put his heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the shoulder with strength, and pull the hand of the weak person downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another servant should hold the head of the weak person, so that it does not move downwards: for it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you make the strong man present who is taller than the weak person, and stand at his side, and insert his shoulder under the eyelid of the weak person: and lift his eyelid upwards, until the weak person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another servant should pull the hand of the weak person to the lower part of his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the weak person is lightweight: then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long stick be fixed in the ground, whose head is round in shape: like a mortar's handle: which is neither thick nor subtle.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then it should be placed under the weak part after they are placed on top of the head with wooden splints and bandages: and the weak part should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand should be extended downwards from the other side, and his body should be extended from the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	What if the reduction of it is difficult through all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is to take a wooden piece whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: which has a rounded head, so that its entrance may be alleviated into the deep wound, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then bandages of cloth should be tied over the rounded head, so that it does not harm the weak part.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it should be placed under the weak wound, so that the hand or arm is extended over the wooden piece to the lower parts: and the wood is tied on top with a bandage and arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm should be placed on the step of a ladder for width, and the hand extended to the lower parts, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint enters into place immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore its entrance is completed according to whichever mode is possible: then it should be placed under the wound a ball equal in quantity made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a plaster prepared from powder of milled material with oliban and albumen of egg on the whole shoulder, as it turns out above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tie under the wound a bandage of suitable material: and roll a ligature over the plaster above: and attach his hand to its neck, and let it be, nor move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that food of little nourishment should be given to the weak person, until the member is comforted: for it is swift to its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger dressing is applied after seven days, or five, and it is exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If then it becomes firm and is not softened, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the joint becomes dislocated many times, because of the moisture that happens to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that a cautery with three openings be administered to it, according to what was previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	What if all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not confirmed, and the plaster and bandage are applied over it several times, and it does not become firm, and it falls, and it cannot be lifted to the upper parts: then know that the nerves which are at the head of the shoulder have already been cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But a dislocation which occurs towards the breast and nipple, or to the back, is reduced with an impulse and extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining bandage and care are administered to it, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	What if after healing heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then let the weak one use a bath many times, until that heaviness is alleviated, and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the cure of dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and it dislocates to all parts, and especially to the front or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: since it is evident to sight and touch, according to whatever figure it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, that is shown to you manifestly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is injured, and it cannot bend the arm, nor touch with it its shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you should reduce the dislocation immediately, before there comes to it a hot aposteme.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot aposteme comes to it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it will not be healed at all, especially when it is to the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocation, and more vehement pain is to them: and many times death comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it, when it is among those things which are possible to reduce, is that the hand of it should be extended with two hands: and its arm should be stretched out, and the hands of the doctor should be above the elbow and below it, and he himself should push the joint with his thumbs or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he bends his hand with his own hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	What if the dislocation does not obey to reduction, then administer a strong and forceful extension: and it is that two ministers should extend the arm, and two ministers should also hold it, so that it does not move at the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then let the arm be turned to every part, after which a doubled and long cloth is wrapped over its hand, or a broad bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches with his hand the joint, let him anoint it with oil: that it may be among those things which help in the lubricity of the joint with facility.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he pushes the joint with a strong push, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary that there be put upon it a plaster, in which there is styptic and excitation with the white of egg: and let it be bound with a moderate bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm hang from the neck of the weak person, and let it be for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be undone.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the joint is strengthened in its place, then undo the bandage from it, and let it be.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not being well bound, then apply a plaster again, and a bandage, and let it be for some days, until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then undo it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however a heaviness occurs to it after the reduction of the joint, and the arrangement is in motion: then administer a moistening in bathing, and subtle rubbing, and compression, until it is alleviated, or put on the joint a plaster of fat, that is, the grease of the spleen.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then let it be bound, and let it be upon it for a day and a night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and put it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it sweats, then rub the joint with a moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over it the application of ointment one time, and a second, and a third with the entrance into the bath, until it is alleviated.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, put on it a cow's dung, moist, warmed with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It itself is alleviated, and returns to its own arrangement.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	Of the cure of the dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The elbow of the hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary, of the rest of the joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Truly however it is necessary, that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place becomes calloused: or else a warm callous forms on it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of dislocation in it is, that you put the weak hand of Mahassem on the table, and the assistant extends his hand; and the physician puts his palm on the prominence of the joint, and drives it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	It is nevertheless necessary that it be considered, if the palm has already receded to the ventral side of the hand: then the weak one puts the back of his hand on the table at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation proceeds to the dorsal side of the hand, then let the position of the hand be inward on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand be put on the table, so that the hand of the physician falls on the same prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster, having applied an apostema: and leave it, nor repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you over its reduction, after the days have passed, nevertheless the joint remains according to its curvature: and nothing harms the weak one, except that the hand becomes soft, and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves are cut or bruised.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no ingenuity in it, except that it be bound with a cauterization near its fracture.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not bind at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not return, then put on it the plaster that we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be bound and left for five days: afterwards let it be unbound and exercised, and the hand moved.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if its motion is hindered, and something heavy happens to it: then soften it with warm water and rubbing several times, until it is softened.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the cure of dislocations of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated to any side, or a finger to the back of the palm, or its front: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and hang it to the upper part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang it, and extend it, until it becomes straight on that day of its own.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night arrives, bind it according to the narration itself: and do not cease to loosen it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days, until it becomes tight.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do similarly with it, if it is dislocated to the joint of the hand: and bind it to the same part, and perform your first operation with it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do likewise with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Of the cure of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When there occurs to someone a dislocation of the vertebrae of the back, or a complete dislocation of the neck, or many vertebrae are displaced from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death quickly follows the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the bowel movement of the sick person goes out without control, and he cannot hold it: and often some of his limbs become paralyzed, or both thighs, or both arms of the same, or one of them: or one vertebra is displaced from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it happens that there is a displacement, which often results in the displacement to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is displaced to the back is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure of it is, that you should consider then, if the gibbosity occurs from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things to these, the ancients have already spoken of the methods of cure in lengthy discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whose profit is not returned with advantage.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I indeed have already abbreviated from that, whose little is excused by much of it due to my proximity to the intention: and my exposition which I expounded on it, and formed its instrument in a different way than that which they showed it, and expounded it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in the humpness which happens on the front side, there is no ingenuity, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which is done on the two sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, except that which happens on the back properly, with what I relate: and it is, that the weak one is extended on his face on a level platform near the wall: and a wet cloth is spread under him, so that his chest is not injured.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight stick is placed fixed in a hole in the ground, at the edge of the platform, around his head: and another stick around his feet at the other edge of the platform: and an assistant holds the stick, and it is not firmly set in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another assistant holds the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then tie over the head of the weak one, and under his armpits a soft bandage, firm: and extend the end of the bandage to the stick that is by his head: and tie it on that.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tie another bandage above his hips, and above his knees, and at his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages, and tie them on the other stick that is by his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then every assistant extends to the part of the stick a bandage, and the two sticks are not removed from their places where they are fixed: nevertheless they are not made firm, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician puts his palms on the spine with force, until it returns: or he puts a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he should tie his feet above the table, until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however he does not return through this treatment, then take a tablet whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And let the place on the side of which we have spoken, which is near the weak part, be where the end of the tablet enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then put the middle of the tablet on the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him pull firmly, until the vertebra is constricted and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a turnkey that turns with your hand: and it is, as you fix in the ground by the head of the weak person at the end of the bed two sticks, whose length is one cubit: and by its head at the end of the bed two sticks.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length that is between each stick be one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place where the turnkey runs: and let each stick be firmly fixed in the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round stick be inserted: and it is a turnkey on which a rope turns in the two holes of the two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And on its end is a hole, in which the stick is fixed, whose length is a palm and that which turns: and in two other sticks there is similarly one of them.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then pull the ropes that you have pulled on the chest of the weak person with the turnkey that is at his head: and the ropes that you have pulled on its legs with the turnkey that is at its feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then a servant stands at each turnkey, who turns his hand with a rope, with which the turnkey turns: and the doctor adjusts the vertebra, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the shape of the turn, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the spondilis returns and the location is evened, then it is opportune to apply an excitatory plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a swab.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards put on top of the plaster a bar from a board, the width of which is three fingers, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length such quantity as to cover the place of the gibbosity and over the healthy part of the spondilis.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then let it be bound with a bandage which we have mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the weak person use subtle nourishment, until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	What if something of the swelling remains in the place at the end of the healing: then it is opportune to administer medicines which soften and soothe, with the administration of the bar which we have described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now let it be applied on that plate of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when there occurs a swelling at the last of the spine of the back, and it is thought that there is a dislocation because of it, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Wherefore it is not opportune to prescribe for him with this medicine: perhaps indeed it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Of the cure of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the joints of the ankle and the joints of the shoulder do not undergo anything except dislocation only: nor does there occur to them what occurs to the other joints from a slight removal and concussion.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the joint of the ankle is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is, that it is dislocated to the front and to the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And mostly indeed it is dislocated to the inside: and a little is dislocated to the front and to the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation inward is that when you join the weak leg with the weak one, it is longer and its knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the weak one cannot bend its foot at the groin: and there is a place that follows the groin which is affected by a warm apostem, because the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of one to whom dislocation outward happens is that they are accidents contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one to whom dislocation forward happens is that it stretches the healthy leg according to its complement: nevertheless it does not bend it without pain which is in the knee: and if it tries to walk, it cannot step on it forward: and its urine is retained, and its groin becomes affected by a collection of pus, and upon walking its foot is stepped on at the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of one to whom dislocation backward happens is that it does not stretch the knee, nor can it bend before it bends the groin: and its leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this type of dislocation is that you should consider then if the dislocation is old, which has already become chronic with the person having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its disposition: then there is no treatment for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not suitable that a complete reduction be attempted on it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In the case, however, where the dislocation is recent and is one of the four types of dislocation: then it is proper to do this, that you should move the joint, and extend it inward and outward, and move it to the right and left: for perhaps it returns, and does not need other treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If however it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you should prepare a strong assistant, and let him extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage, which is tied above his leg over the knee: and another assistant extends his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under his armpits.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie it with a linen bandage over the hip joint, and hold the end of another bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let its extension be either from the front part of the groin to the region of the armpit, or from the back to the region of the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all of them be in place of one, until the weak one is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this indeed is a type of extension which is a common type among four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If the displacement then returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for every type to that which I shall speak of concerning its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of it indeed, when the displacement is inward, it is necessary that the weak one be placed on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then a bandage should be placed over the hip joint, on what is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upwards from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the region of the armpit.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong servant should take his arms, and hold the thick part of the weak hip, and pull it to the outside with a vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For it has now returned to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the other types of cure, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If however it projects above you, and does not submit to the entrance with this type of cure at all: then it is necessary that the two weak feet be bound together with a strong, linen bandage, over the two heels and over the two knees: and let the length of each be from its fellow as much as four fingers: and let the weak leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weak one should be suspended over the head of a wooden beam, which is in the house: and its length from the ground should be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong youth to support the hip so that it protects the head of the thigh, and let one weak youth suspend it, and let another youth push it, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In the reduction of it however to its proper place, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the weak one lies on a platform, according to what we have described for the one having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let a ligament be tied above his shin, weak in its proper place, and above his breast.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two sticks are placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a stick is placed added in the middle of the platform, fixed well: on which are wrapped wet cloths, so that it does not harm the weak one: and let the stick be between his hips, so that it is not drawn to the lower parts at extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then every assistant stretches to his own part, and the physician effects the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it obeys to the reduction, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, put on it a board, and press on it, as we have said in the case of a hump, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Truly however it is necessary, that the weak one lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the weak leg be extended quickly: and it is according to this same narration on the platform: and the physician puts the palm of his right hand on the weak groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he tightens it with his other hand, and with that tightening he puts it extended downwards to the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the weak one be extended downwards, and let it be elevated above the ground: indeed it is necessary that it be placed on a hard object, as it is necessary, which is also done if his hip dislocates outward, according to what we have said about its placement on two hips: and it is on its face, and the ligaments are extended: according to what we have said above.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression with a pad be administered over the place from which the joint protrudes, when the reduction is completed according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is that you stretch out the two legs of the weak one; and when you see them equal, and the weak one draws in its leg and stretches it out without effort: then you know that the limb has already returned according to what is necessary: then join the two hips, and put on a plaster, and tie with a bandage, that is, a wheel: so that it does not move to any part: and let the weak one adhere quietly for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then untie the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is already stabilized: therefore let the weak one walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see something relaxed: then reduce and plaster it, and tie it according to your first tightness: and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then untie it and make it walk slowly on both for some days, until it is well comforted.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	On the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee dislocates in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It dislocates outward, inward, and downward, namely to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you will make the weak one apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not stick to the hip: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is, that you make the weak one sit upright, so that he already stretches his leg if he can over it, and you stick your back to his face: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his knee adhere to your palms and straighten them between your fingers on his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply your palm to both sides of his knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And let another assistant stretch his foot until his knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres to the thigh gently, not with difficulty.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it and make the leg adhere to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three days or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then untie them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the weak person should not use walking for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If however the reduction of it is refused to you, then administer a strong extension with bandages, whose explanation has preceded in the cure of hernia, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the cure of dislocation of the heel bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone is sometimes moved by a small displacement, and sometimes it is dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either to the inside or to the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen and protruding on the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its displacement is easy reduction: and it is that it should be extended with ease by the hands and straightened until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the cure of it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the weak person sit upright and a strong assistant hold him firmly from behind on the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold with your right hand his foot from the upper part of it and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the place of the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left two veins.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch with the left, and strike the chest of the foot with the right turned calf without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then strike the chest of the foot to the leg in a third vein, and you will draw out the vein.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then it returns in one vein, or in two according to this method, and you see the foot equalized, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on it: for it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however the reduction of it is prohibited to you with what we have described: then make the weak one throw itself on its back on the ground, and fix a strong stake in the earth firmly, so that it falls between its thighs: and you have already wrapped a cloth around it, so that it does not harm the weak one.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take its thigh: afterwards the assistant will stretch the other foot, either with his hands, or with a bandage that is tied above the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every assistant stretch against the stretching of its companion: and the stake stand between the two thighs of the weak one, retaining it, so that its body is not drawn to the lower parts at the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician equalizes the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with swiftness.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and the health of its return is declared to you: then put on a plaster and a dressing, and bind it with strong bandages, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or avoid the nerves which are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not pressing on them and harms them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	What if the ligament is softened, bind it tightly: then loosen it on the third or fourth day: and prohibit the weak from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If a wound is bothered to walk before that time, there will not be safety unless a dislocation is dissolved upon it, and it becomes rotten, and it does not receive a cure after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	What if a hot aposteme happens to it: then it is necessary that you administer to its sedation what our narration previously mentioned in another place concerning the cure, and an embrocation, until it is removed.

Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated among them should be reduced with a little extension without labor: and that indeed is not difficult, indeed it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in certain nodes of the foot's back: then it is necessary that the weak person make his foot sit on an equal place with the ground, or on a board: and he stands as one walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and put your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then tread on it with your foot with strength, until it returns, and you see that it is now equal, and the prominence does not appear in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the arch of his foot a board that can hold the whole foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it tightly for three days with a suitable dressing.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured from the dislocation.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the species of dislocations with a wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of that kind happens, and you consider its cure and restoration, death often follows: and because of this it is not necessary that one should presume to treat it, unless he who is prudent in the art through long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not daring, nor presumptuous: and that he use in apprehension medicines which calm hot apostems: and commit the weak to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you wait, or hope for salvation from destruction with gentleness of sickness, and in which appears something of the hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	I therefore consider reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the thing, before there occurs a warm aposteme.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the limb returns, according to which you wish, then administer the regime that calms the aposteme: and treat the wound with that which suits it from dried plasters.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	What if the dislocation is with a fracture, and they occur in a separated bone of the breastplate, then consider removal of them, and do in that which we said in simple sicknesses from what preceded in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your virtue, and guard yourself from entrance into the way of fear: according to what my preaching preceded to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and more healthy to your body with them in your time.
