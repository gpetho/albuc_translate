On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Chapter 76.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have discussed in the section on medication, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use manual intervention, then you must consider.
If the woman is of sound strength and does not have any conditions that would threaten her life, then the woman should be laid on her back on a bed, with her head inclined downward and her legs elevated; an assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the fetus's extraction.
Then moisten the mouth of the uterus with softening oils made with the mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages, and then insert it into the uterus gently.
Then she should look with her hand for a place where she can secure hooks into the fetus, and find suitable locations for this.
Therefore, if the fetus is positioned to descend head first, then place the hooks in its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or its breastbone, or in locations near the ribs and under the hypochondria.
If, however, it descends feet first, then in its groin and middle ribs.
She should hold the hook with her right hand and place its curve between the fingers of her left hand; then insert it with ease and secure the hook in one of those locations mentioned, until she reaches an empty space.
Then she should fix another hook opposite it, or a third if needed, so that the pull is even and does not lean to one side.
Then pull with equal force, not only in a straight line, but move it in all directions, to ease its exit, as is done with a tooth during extraction.
And it is necessary that, in between these actions, the extension is softened.
If a part is held back, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert them from the side, to rotate what is being held.
If a part of the fetus emerges, then shift the hooks to a higher location; do this until the entire fetus exits.
If a hand emerges before the others, and it is impossible to push it back due to its restriction, then it should be wrapped in a cloth.
Then pull it until it fully exits, and cut it either at the wrist or elbow; do likewise with the other hand and both feet.
If, however, the fetus's head is large, or it is restricted in the exit, or there is fluid accumulated in its head, then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a thorny spatumile, and split the head with it to extract the fluid, or rupture it with an instrument called an Almisdac, the form of which appears with the other instrument forms in the chapter after this one.
Similarly, if the fetus has a naturally large head, then it is necessary to cut it with the algengematu or extract it with the misdach, as we have described.
Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges but becomes restricted at the breastbone, then it should be split until the moisture in the chest is released.
If it does not fold or permit exit, then cut the head into pieces as much as is possible for you.
If there is an abscess in the lower abdomen, or if there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary to pierce it until the fluid flows out.
If the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction toward the mouth of the uterus is smooth.
If it becomes restricted at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and split the abdomen or chest until the contents flow out.
If the other limbs have been removed and the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
If the mouth of the uterus is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the uterus, search for the head with it, and draw it toward the mouth of the uterus with her fingers; then insert one hook or two into it and pull it out with them.
If the mouth of the uterus is restricted due to a warm abscess that has occurred, then it is not necessary to work on it; rather, it is necessary to apply moist, fatty substances, apply poultices, and have her sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to straighten it; then apply the same treatment that we discussed for a live fetus.
If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary not to leave any part of the afterbirth inside at all.
When you have completed your operation, then administer what we mentioned regarding warm abscesses that occur in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, then let her sit in astringent waters and administer the remaining treatment.
I myself have seen a woman in whose womb a fetus had died; she then became pregnant again over it, and afterward that fetus also died.
After a long time, an abscess developed in her navel, and it swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus.
I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
So I applied to it some poultices with strong drawing power, and a bone came out of the place.
Then, after a few days, another bone emerged.
I was amazed at this, since there are no bones in the womb.
So I thought that they were bones of the dead fetus.
I therefore explored the wound and extracted many bones, the woman being in better health, and she continued to live in this condition for a long time, discharging a small amount of pus from the place.
I record this unusual case here only because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skillful physician accomplishes by hand in treatment.
