A dislocation occurs when a joint is out of place, causing the limb to be misshapen and the patient to experience great pain and injury.	A dislocation is a displacement of any of the joints from its place, whereby the movement of the joint is hindered, the member is deformed, and the patient is caused violent pain and hurt.	0.76546764
When a dislocation happens to someone, it must be reduced (put back in place) immediately without delay.	When anyone sustains a dislocation he should hasten to have it reduced, not delaying it at all.	0.6834394
If one delays, the area will swell, and then it will be difficult to put back in place; for this reason, it should not be moved when swollen: it often causes spasms and other pains.	For if it is delayed the place will swell up and the reduction will be thereby made difficult. So it should not be delayed, nor moved or extended during the time it is swollen, for that often leads to spasm and excruciating pain.	0.7947173
However, if this happens, make the patient bleed, then leave it until the hot swelling subsides; then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently put it back, and treat each limb as necessary.	Instead, when this occurs, you must hasten to venesect the patient, and then let be until the swelling has subsided a little. Then massage the member with hot water and oil and let it be gently reduced. And treat every member with the things that will be mentioned in their place.	0.83469737
And I have organized the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.	I have disposed the chapters on dislocations in the same order as the foregoing ones on fractures, that is, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.	0.5826735
