You should straighten what has dislocated from it by gentle extension without force, and that is not difficult, rather it is easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, then the patient should place his foot on a level place on the ground.	Any that are dislocated must be straightened by means of gentle extension, without violence; that is not hard but positively easy. If the dislocation be in one of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, the patient must set his foot on level ground or upon a board, standing as though walking.	0.8528737
Or on a board while he is standing like one walking, then you stand and place your foot on whatever protrudes from those joints, then press it down with your foot forcefully until it returns and you see that it is straightened and no protrusion appears in the place.	Then you must stand and put your foot on what protrudes of those joints, and put strong pressure upon it with your foot until it goes back and you see that it is evened out and there is no prominence at the place.	0.79251343
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes the entire foot, which has two ends, then tighten it firmly and securely for three days, then loosen it and protect it from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are safe from recurrence, God willing.	Then put under the sole of his foot a flat splint with two heads to take the whole foot, and bind it on with a tight and secure bandage for three days; then loosen it; but keep him from walking for a good many days until it binds and you are sure it will not revert, God willing.	0.9122452
