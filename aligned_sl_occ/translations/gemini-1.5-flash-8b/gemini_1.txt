O, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, by its completion its end is achieved, and through its explanations and declarations, it seems to me that I have fulfilled it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practical application of the art, that is, surgery.
For the art of surgery is now, in our region and time, almost entirely lost, so that the science of it is greatly endangered, and its knowledge is obscured; and of it only some brief descriptions remain in the books of the ancients, which, through the passage of time, have given rise to errors and uncertainties, until its understanding is clouded and its strength and art have diminished.
And it seems to me that I can revitalize it [the art of surgery] by means of this treatise, in accordance with the method of exposition, declaration, and summary; and that it may be understood through the descriptions of cautery instruments and other surgical tools, accompanied by an explanation and preparation of them, a necessary process.
However, the reason why a skilled craftsman with a skilled hand is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner needs to be versed in the science of anatomy, which describes the parts of the body so that he knows the structure and form of the limbs, their connection and separation; and has knowledge of the bones, nerves and muscles, their numbers, and their distribution; and of the pulsating and stationary veins, and the places from which they arise.
And therefore Hippocrates says that a name is much, but the work is little, especially in the art of handcraft.
But we have already discussed this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is ignorant of what we have said about anatomy will inevitably fall into errors that will cause people to die, as I have seen many such instances, for some are trained in this science, but abandon it without knowledge and experience.
For I saw an unskilled and foolish physician open a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some arteries in the neck, causing a large amount of blood to flow until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician attempt to remove a stone from a man who had grown old, and the stone was large; he went to him and removed the stone along with a piece of the bladder, so that the man died on the third day.
And I already warned against doing that, and saw that due to the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I knew beforehand that he would die.
And I saw another physician, who received payment from a duke in our land for surgery, and went to a dark-skinned man whose leg was fractured; the physician, due to his ignorance, reduced the fracture, pressing against the wound with bandages and splints with excessive force, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he treated it according to his own desires, and bound it together, and left it for several days, and commanded that we loosen the ligature; and it remained like that until the thigh and foot became infected with an abscess, and led to ruin.
And I was called to him, and I proceeded to loosen the ligature, and achieved tranquility and alleviation of his pain.
However, corruption had already taken hold in the limb, so I could not stop it, and the corruption continued in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated in a few days, until the evil of it was greatly aggravated by the patient's condition.
Because cancerous tumors are pure melancholy humor, therefore they should not be treated with a complete cauterization, unless the limb is deemed to be completely diseased.
Therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the surgical operation be divided into two parts: one being the operation associated with health, and the other, an operation that is perilous in the most extreme cases.
And I have already described this throughout this book, where there is operation that involves error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to guard against this and abandon it, so that the fools may not find a way to speak ill and disgrace you.
Therefore, take your tools with diligence and with God's protection, and treat your patients with skill and firmness.
And use the best method, through God's grace, seeking health and a praiseworthy outcome, and abandon terrible illnesses with difficult cures, and remove from your practice anything that causes you fear, so that your dedication to your faith and your name may not fail you: for greater glory remains for you, and higher in the world and behind your holiness.
Gualia has already said in some of his teachings: Do not treat a serious illness, lest you be called bad doctors.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter, ordered from head to foot, describes the forms of instruments and the implements of cauteries, and what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of incision and perforation, and of cupping, and of plasters, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, is entirely categorised and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on the treatment of twisting and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and concerning the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary for me to describe the benefits of this cautery and its harms, and in what constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore, I say that the discourse on the nature of the benefits of cautery and its harms is a long and verbose discourse, subtle in its science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, and it suffices for me to briefly mention some of their discourses, fearing length.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all constitutions universally, whether with or without matter, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitutions without matter.
In the hot and dry constitution with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial in that case, and others say the opposite, that cautery is not suitable in an illness characterized by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is undesirable to treat a hot and dry illness with something that is also hot and dry.
And those who say the opposite claim that cautery provides benefit in every hot and dry illness that afflicts humans, for when you compare the body and its humours to the constitution of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I say, concerning this matter, that experience has shown this to me several times.
However, this should not be accepted without careful consideration by someone who is already experienced and skilled in the practice of cautery, who has understood the diversity of human constitutions, the various types of illnesses, their causes, the symptoms, and the appropriate timeframes for treatment.
But in other constitutions, you have no need for such caution, and especially in cold and moist illnesses, for all physicians have agreed on this, and are not in disagreement about the use of cautery in those cases.
And understand, children, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness, lies in the difference between cautery with fire and cautery with medicinal remedies.  This is because fire is simple; its action affects only the member being cauterized, and does not harm other members connected to it except with minor damage.
However, the action of medicinal cauterization extends to the affected member and the surrounding areas, and it can easily introduce difficult-to-cure illnesses and pain to the member itself.
But fire, due to its purity and beneficial nature, does not do this; it simply removes excess.  We already know this from experience and a long study of the art and the truth of its causes; therefore I excuse myself from further lengthy discourse.  And if it were not that this topic, concerning the secret of fire's application to the body, and its ability to expel illnesses through its specific action, is already covered in detail in my book,  I would demonstrate its operation with a philosophical and conclusive argument, to enlighten you better.
And understand, children, that they disagree on the best time for cautery, and consider springtime the most suitable.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm caused by unfavorable timing is overshadowed by the benefit of what is drawn out by the cautery, especially if the cautery is necessary for sharp, sudden pains, which cannot tolerate delay, as the fear of greater harm from a prolonged illness outweighs any small harm from an immediate cautery.
And this is not something to consider, my children, it is only the opinion of the common people and foolish physicians, that is, that a disease cured by cautery does not always require a return to the original state, and that condition is considered to be sufficient.
And the reason is not as they think, for cautery is not a replacement for medicine, but rather an alteration of the body's constitution, drying out the moisture that causes the pain.
However, cautery is superior to medicine in terms of its power and efficacy and the greatness of its effect.
And it is possible for the illness to return at some point in time, depending on the patient's constitution, the location of the illness, and the patient's resilience, and the build-up of excess fluids within them, and what has been consumed in food and similar matters; but if the illness for which cautery is administered is a localized illness with limited excess fluids and moisture, like toothache and similar conditions, it is possible that the pain will not return there, but this happens in a milder form.
And it is a common saying that cautery is the last resort in medicine, and it is a truthful statement, not in the way they understand it, for they believe there is no cure that works as well as cautery.
And the truth is the opposite; the idea that cautery is the last resort in medicine is only true when we've tried other treatments for some illnesses, and those treatments did not work, and only then, at the end of the line, is cautery administered, and proves useful. Therefore, from this, it can be seen that cautery is the last resort in medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except because of the nobility and superior quality of gold's substance.
And they said that the place of cautery doesn't burn, which is absolutely not true, for I have already tested this and found that it only happens in some bodies and not others, and cautery with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said; however, when you do cautery with gold fire, it isn't clear to you, because it ignites according to the amount you want due to the gold's resilience, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you apply heat to it, the gold melts by the fire, and some of the gold falls into the fire, so that the craftsman is burned by working with it.
Therefore, cautery with iron is done more easily and more readily for the correct performance of the operation.
And I have organized this chapter on cautery according to sections, and I have ordered them from the head down to the feet, so that the seeker may find what he wants in it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization remedies moisture and coldness affecting the brain, the cause of which are twofold:  a cause of stiffness and a multitude of rheumatic flows, called "corissa" [likely a form of rhinitis], flowing from the head to the eyes and ears, a multitude of sleep disorders, toothaches, and throat ailments, and universally any illness brought on by coldness, such as paralysis, stroke, and similar ailments.
The method of this cauterization is this: first, you should order the patient to be purged with laxatives, cleansing the head, for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and usual constitution.
And then you instruct him to shave his head, and then make him sit between your hands on a smooth bench and have him place his hands on his feet.
And then place the tip of your palm, near the bridge, on the root of his nose between his eyes. However, when the tip of your middle finger has reached that spot, mark that spot with a probe, and then apply the olive cautery, of which this is the form:
And then place that [cautery] on the spot marked with the probe, so that it descends, with which your hand is gradually tightened, and you turn it.
And then gently raise your hand and look at the area, and if you see any significant amount of bone exposed, roughly the size of a grain of millet, then raise your hand, and if not, return your hand with that iron, with another one of those, if it is chilled, until the bone is visible as I have told you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and leave it for three days.
Then place a piece of cloth soaked in butter on it and leave it there until the scab from the burning is destroyed. And then treat the area with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And if the wound remains open, it is better to move the arm, because this is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the bone should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until a part of the bone's surface is burnt.
And then scrape away what has adhered to the bone, and then treat it.
And others say that with the cautery, they should reach the back, to strongly press on the bone until it breaks, and this is the method of a small (minor) cauterization. And they believe that vapors from the head escape from that location.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then treated until it is healed.
However, I have not seen these two types of cauterization in every case, but only in some men according to the way of fear; and in my view, it is better, when possible, with the treatment, because the head is weakened by a disruption of continuity in it, just as we have attested in other limbs, and even more so when the patient's head is of weak constitution.
And the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion; and using that method and procedure will be beneficial.
Second Chapter.
Of the cauterization of the head.
When there is chronic and long-lasting pain in the whole head of a prolonged illness, and the patient has used leeches, cupping, head purges, plasters, poultices, herbs, and similar treatments, and especially if they have already been cauterized with a cautery we have discussed and it hasn't been of any help, then consider that if the patient's head is of strong constitution, and it is not weak and has a great deal of cold, then cauterize with another cautery beneath the first one, a little below. And then cauterize that area on the top of their head with the cautery until the scab is broken. Cut the scab open and expose the bone to the extent we have described, and cauterize that area with a cautery on the back of the head in the place called the *vas*—and that is the spot where a cupping glass is placed. And ease your hand in doing this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience very great pain different from the pain of all other cauteries of the head.
And I would say this cautery is in its proper place, for the cautery used to cauterize the temples and the back of the head should be a more delicate cautery than the one used for the middle of the head; and this is the manner of it.
Third Chapter.
Of the cauterization of not-ancient (or, perhaps, non-chronic) migraine.
When pain is sudden or spreading within the head, the head should be treated with purifying medications, and the other cure, which I have described in the discussions of illnesses, should also be administered.  If this proves ineffective, then cauterization in that location can be done in two ways: either with a burning medicinal cautery, or with an iron cautery.
But a cautery with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and drain it and cauterize the ends of both of its heads. And then, you should make an incision at the location of the pain in the temple with a sharp lancet until a small area beneath the skin has been created and is hidden.
Then apply a bandage to compress it, and leave it for three hours.  Then remove it and the garlic, and allow the wound to heal for two or three days, and then apply a compress of wool soaked in broth until the area is healed.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But the cauterization with iron, according to this method: fire by cautery, of which this is the form:
and it is called a "claus clavilhs," because its head is shaped like a nail, in which there is a slight curvature, and in its middle is a small elevation.
And then place it on the painful area, and hold your hand — so that the surrounding tissue is not burned — and turn the small iron slowly but with speed.
And if the amount of tissue that is burned by the cautery's heat is about half of it, then lift your hand so that the artery underneath is not burned, lest blood flow results.
Then soak some cotton in salt water and place it over the area, and leave it for three days; then place cotton moistened with butter, and then treat with ointment until healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the edge of a scalpel, like a cautery, and be careful not to cut an artery in this particular, not-ancient, method.
Fourth Chapter.
On the cauterization of ancient migraine.
When you treat migraine with what we have said about the previous treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not work, and sometimes because the disease does not respond to what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire, then you must heat the knife-cautery until it is white-hot, and then apply it to the painful area along a line that is half the length of your finger, or even less; and press your hand once, and hold it until you cut through the flesh and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be mindful of the continuity of the jawbone, which is strained by chewing, and that the ligament and the nerve that control it are not injured and do not cause spasm.
And if it is about the care and caution of the flow of blood from the severed artery, for fear arises in its severance, especially for one who does not know what they are doing and is not skilled or experienced; and lets the operation be unfinished at the beginning.
And I will come back to the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery according to its method, in its place within this book.
And if you see that this treatment does not cure this ailment and the patient's condition seems bearable, cauterize the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the cautery we described in the chapter on artery constriction with a cautery having two blades, and this is a better and more useful cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Of the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxatives and the other treatment I mentioned in the division, and the pain does not go away, then cauterize the ear with a cautery, and this is the one called a "puncta," and this is its form:
And then puncture near the ignition, and let it move around the entire ear in a circular fashion, or in the circuit of each affected spot if the pain is in multiple places. Move the cautery along the ear's base slowly, after marking the location with a probe.
And if the cautery makes ten points on the entire ear, cauterize those areas, and then treat the spots until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the cauterization of tumors.
Tumors which are cured by cauterization are only of the types that arise from phlegm, as we have stated in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type that comes from drying out or spasms of the nerve.
When you treat that type of tumor with leeches, purges, and remedies, and your treatment does not prove effective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: the first at the root of the ear, the second a small one below their temple, and the third at the juncture of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the diseased area, for softening occurs only on the side that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery on the right side of the ear's extremity, then slightly higher on the temple, and another on the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the fingertip, and hold your cautery until the amount of the affected area is about half consumed/burnt.
And this is the method of cauterization, and it is a type of surgery, the method of which is described above. However, it is more subtle than what you've seen; and one needs to cut away any superfluous fat/thickness slightly.
And then treat the area with what was previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the cauterization of old apoplexy.
When apoplexy is longstanding, and you've treated it with what we've discussed, and the patient shows no fever, then cauterize the area with four cauteries: one on each temple (corner of the head); one in the middle of the head, as described previously; and one on the nape of the neck (occiput). And the method of cauterization is done as previously stated.
And it has already been cauterized on the opening of the stomach; and further back; and subsequently be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
On cauterization for forgetfulness caused by a flame.
Large jars and pills should be given to the patient at the beginning, to purify the brain.
And then shave the patient's entire head and apply a plaster of cedar described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply it several times, for this is a method of cauterization. And do this according to the same order I have already mentioned.
And so, if this treatment is successful, well and good; but if not, then make three cauteries on the back of their head, descending from the highest part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. And place the thickness of a finger between each cautery, and then treat the cautery with what has been previously described.
But if you wish to add more, and the patient tolerates it, then make a cautery in the middle area; and if you want a greater addition, then cauterize the area above the two horns.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the entire body.
You should proceed with the cleansing of the head with herbs and what we have mentioned; then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with cauteries on all the horns of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if in the illness of the softening of the body, the patient is tolerant and the illness is severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and continually with a cautery until it is softened from the backbone, and remove your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be an olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat the brain at the outset with herbs and other treatments that we have described in the division, when the illness is severe and can tolerate the depletion of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate the medicines, then administer remedies and masticatories that treat the brain, for several days beforehand, along with a good diet.
And then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, according to the previous method, and with another cautery on the back of their head, and cauterize on each side of the head. And if the illness is severe and can tolerate it, then cauterize it with the cauteries mentioned, having simultaneously applied paralysis and softening of the body to the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
Let the cautery be olive-shaped, as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a smaller cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted moisture and thick phlegm, then cauterize that with the cauteries we have mentioned in the previous discussion on paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess leaning towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink that which cleanses his brain according to what has been previously described in the division.
And then shave the patient's head, and then apply a properly made torquetum (a type of bandage or device) around the head, and then place it in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and held securely in all parts of the body.
And then apply a liniment; and it is better to use old sheep's wool. And warm that over the fire with a measured, moderate heat, which the said patient can tolerate when placed on him. And then place that in the middle of his/her head, within the bandage/torquetum, and leave it until it is cooled.
And do this with the patient once a week, along with the rest of their treatment until they are healed; or, if you wish, cauterize that area making small punctures according to his/her tolerance, holding the hand with a cautery specially designed for this; this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain evenly.
And then place that cloth soaked in wool or henbane.
Chapter 12.
On the cauterization of descending water in the ear.
When you have observed the initial symptoms of water in the ear, as described in the previous section, then begin by giving the patient drinks that will help clear their head, and keep them from excess moisture.
And make them sweat in a bath for a few days.
And then command that the patient shave their head, and cauterize the affected area in the middle of the head; and then cauterize with two cauteries on both temples if the onset of water is in both ears, or on one temple if the water is in only one ear.
Cauterize all the veins and arteries beneath the scalp; and let the cauteries be located as far apart as the temples.
And beware of blood flow during the cauterization; and if you see blood flow, stop it with any medicine possible.
And I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries and the excision of them and the prevention of blood flow.
And sometimes the neck is cauterized below the two bones with two cauteries placed directly in contact.
Chapter 13.
Of cauterization of old sores.
When sores on the face are chronic and through the veins and arteries that are in the visible area of the head, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegm, then cauterize it with the cautery we have described in the chapter on applying hot water to sores, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries on the neck below the temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. And if you need further treatment, then cauterize it along the entire length of the sore's edge, on the end of the eyebrow, with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal foul odor.
If your treatment using the methods described in the division is unsuccessful, then prepare and give the patient porridge to drink for three nights; afterwards, shave the patient's head, and cauterize it with a middle-sized cautery and an olive-oil cautery. And then cauterize it with a clove-shaped cautery, using two cauteries on both eyebrows below the hair, a small one for each.
And be careful of the sparks, lest you set it alight.
And this is the shape of the clove-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.
Of cauterization for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery using this lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize a small area above the two eyebrows with two cauteries on all sides, and they should be extended away from the temples. And the length of each cautery should be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand and the cautery, but according to the quantity needed for one-third of the eyelid to be adhered.
Chapter 16.
Concerning cauterization of the eyelid when the hairs are turned inwards and the eye is inflamed.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inwards, causing inflammation, cauterization in those cases is done in two ways: either with a burning iron or with a cauterizing medicine.
If with a cauterizing iron, tell the patient beforehand to remove their eyelashes, just as they would clean them, until they are elongated and spread out; and if those hairs are inflamed near their roots, then you should bind the eyes with a bandage so that they are not injured until the hairs have regrown.
Then, once they have grown back and spread out, place the patient's head on your lap, and carefully apply a cauterizing agent to the eyelid with a small tool, shaped like a leaf, starting near the hairs.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or a pthilli (likely a type of medicinal preparation) over the eye.
And then heat the cautery iron, which has this specific shape.
And then cauterize in small, repeated passes, following the shape you marked, until the surface of the inflamed area, which resembles a myrtle leaf, has been completely burned.
A sign of successful treatment is that you see the eyelid contracted and the hairs raised towards the puncture wound on the eye.
And then elevate your hand and leave it like that for three days, and then place cotton with a bandage over it until the scab is gone. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if any cause returns to the place of origin and the eyelid is softened, then do the cauterization again, exactly as you did at first.
But if the hairs are under the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural position and is smoothed, and the hairs do not irritate the eye.
But the cautery with a burning medicine, which you order the patient to leave the hairs until they are stretched and smoothed, and then a form of myrtle leaf is made of cloth.
And then take a known herb and a living animal's fat, or something like that, and mix those things well, and do this quickly so it doesn't get cold.  Then spread this mixture over the cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place it over the one or both eyes.  Place a cloth soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head should be on a pillow.
And place the fingertip on the medicine and press it a little bit, and do not remove it until the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, for the burning sensation should be like that of fire.
And then, as long as the patient feels the burning sensation, leave the medicine in place and hold it with your finger.  Once the burning sensation stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.  Then, consider whether the eyelid has been lifted to the correct position by the cauterization, either burning or incision.  If so, it is correct.  If not, apply more medicine to the area where it wasn't previously applied and repeat until the eyelid is smoothed out and the eye is healed.
Then apply a bandage to the area until the burning sensation is gone, and then treat it with a specific ointment or another remedy until it is healed.
You must, after your procedure, carefully watch that no medicine gets into the eye.  If, after a few days, the eyelid is swollen and some of the medicine is in the eye, then re-apply your medicine to that swollen part of the eyelid, as you did in the beginning.  And continue to do so until it is healed.
And this is the method of treating a wound with myrtle leaves.
Understand that human wounds vary in size and severity, and therefore your treatment is adjusted accordingly.
And the path to recovery for the one studying this art will not be hidden.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of fistulas in the tear duct of a wound.
When you treat a fistula using the methods discussed in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment doesn't improve it, then you should cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and have a servant hold their head between your hands, so that it's not jostled or moved by their head movements.
And then apply a piece of lint soaked in egg white or a poultice of plantain to the wound.
And then apply the cautery, which is shaped like this:
which should be concave, shaped like a reed or a hawk's feather, at the end where the cautery is made.
And if desired, let it penetrate into the other end. And if you want, let it be shaped like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
And then press on the fistula if it is open, and drain and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus from it.
And then place the heated cautery on it, and hold your hand a little above the cautery near the opening of the nose, so that neither your hand nor the patient is disturbed. Then place the cautery on the edge of the opening and burn it away.
And so, if your cautery penetrates the bone at the beginning, good.  But if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice if necessary.  Leave it like this for three days, and then place a bandage over it with a poultice and surround it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if more than ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and smooth as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another way of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier practitioners said:  Open the site of the fistula and then place in that fissure a thin, fine lead of which the form is thus:  Pour in that fissure about one inch of molten lead; hold your hand over it with a good grip, so that the patient is not moved lest the molten lead should reach the opening.  It is necessary to place over the patient's opening a bandage soaked in egg white or water, because the lead will adhere to the site of the fistula and heal it with astonishing speed.
And if the fistula is healed by what we have described about cauterization and treatment, it is well.  But if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal incision and reduce the fistula to its proper place within the nasal cavity.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the cauterization of the fissure of the pot.  (Or, Concerning the cauterization of a fissure in the [part of the body associated with] the pot).
Often fissures occur in the lips, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have described in the divisions and your treatment is not effective, then heat the small, knife-like cautery in this manner described below:
And let its cavity be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then carefully place that heated cautery on those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat it with a plaster until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When an abscess forms at the base of the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, and a boil develops, and then bursts, and then becomes chronic, and a fistula forms, and then you treat it and the treatment doesn't work, then you must cauterize it with fire according to the size of the opening in the fistula.  Then put that heated iron into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand there until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it.  Do this one or two times.  Then treat it with the remedies we've discussed for healing until it is cured.
And so, if the diseased tissue is cut away and healed, that is good; but if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be discussed in its own chapter.
Chapter 20.
Of cauterization of the teeth and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and it does not work, then place the patient's head on your lap, then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be described later, so that you place the tube over the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it.  Hold your hand there briefly until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as you wish.
Then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out. For the loose tooth will be fixed, the softened gums will be strengthened, and the corrupt moisture will be dried out.
Chapter 21.
Of cauterization for tooth pain.
When tooth pain is due to cold, or there is cold or a worm in it, or medicine does not bring a cure, then cauterization there is done in two ways: either with a cow's hoof cautery or with fire.
Cauterization with a hoof is done by taking a cow's hoof, boiling it in an iron container.  Then take a cloth, wrap it around the end of the probe, and dip that into the boiled hoof.  Then quickly place this over the aching tooth until it cools.
And repeat this several times until the heat's effect reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cloth in the aforementioned hoof, and place it over the aching tooth. Then place heated iron on top of that until the iron reaches the cavity of the tooth.
However, cauterization with fire is done by using a heated iron or bronze instrument, and it should be of a certain thickness so the heat doesn't reach the patient's mouth.
And then heat the cautery, shape it as needed, and place it on the tooth, holding it until it cools; repeat this a few times until the pain is gone, either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, by pressure of this cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good broth and hold it for an hour, then spit it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize any extremity you can, as you see fit.
And this is the method of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Of the cauterization of extrophulos.
When extrophulos are of phlegm and cold humors, and are not yielding to digestion by medicines, and you desire a light digestion of them, then you heat the cautery, the shape of which is as follows, having two open ends so that smoke can escape from the cautery from the other end, and place this heated cautery on the abscess once, and again if necessary, until the inflammation of the abscess is reached.
And if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and place cotton soaked in broth over it until what the fire has burned is healed.
And then treat it with ointments, bandages, and dressings until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
On the cauterization of hoarseness of the voice and constriction of the throat.
When humidity affects the airway, especially when it's caused by a cold constitution, the patient should first be relieved with laxative medicines, and then cauterize the area near the root of the throat in the affected spot.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, or to burn the skin too deeply, but only a little.
And cauterize the area with another cautery near the junction of the neck and the back (spinal column). And the cautery should be a sharp, pointed one, in the same manner as before.
And then treat the area with what was previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Of cauterization for lung disease and coughs.
When coughs and lung ailments are caused by cold humidity and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the illness is long-standing, then cauterize the area with two cauteries on the furcula, in the depressed, distant and bulging spots; and with another cautery in the middle area of the chest, between the two breasts; and the cautery should be sharp, according to the previous method.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be by puncturing with the cautery called "puncta," the method of which is described in the treatment of earaches.
And make punctures on those areas; and then treat it with the same remedies as previously described until it is healed.
And the cautery should have three points, for cauterization is done with that; with one application you can make three cauteries according to this method:
Chapter 25.
Of cauterization of the titillic, which is the head of the aid.
When the head of the aid (likely a joint, a specific anatomical part) is dislocated due to lubricating moisture and does not stay in place after its return from dislocation until it is fully in position, and then, by a slight movement, it is dislocated again as it should, as we have witnessed, then you must first reduce the dislocation, and then turn the patient on their back or side; and then raise the tendon that is inside the titillic to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inwards.
And then apply the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the tendon until it penetrates to the other side; and the shape of cauterization will then be like that of four-headed cauteries.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore the cauteries are eight.
And then place salt-soaked linen on the cauterized area, and then keep the patient at rest, and do not move the limb for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize the muscle with a pointed or multiple-pointed cautery, for the joint is strengthened and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture enter the stomach, causing a deviation from its constitution and its multiplication accumulating there, and if you continue the methods of treatment without success, then the patient should be placed on their back, extending their arms and legs, and then cauterize that area with three cauteries: one below the foot, about the width of a finger, with a pointed cautery, and two others beneath the two sides of the first, creating a triangular cautery shape; and lengthen the cauteries where they are not close together to create a deeper effect.
And if the depth of the cautery is the amount of two-thirds the thickness of a finger.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without additions.  And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this be a cautery in the form of a circle in this shape:
And let the stomach be cauterized by puncturing the affected area with this cautery:  You should prick the stomach, using a probe, with as many points as desired. Then cauterize the pricked spots with a cautery.  Thereafter, treat the area with the previous remedies until healed.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the cauterization of a cold liver.
When pain in the liver arises from coldness, or moisture, or excessive wind, until its normal constitution is expelled by the discharge of excess, and the patient is not cured by what we have already discussed, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on their back.  Puncture the liver beneath the ribs (hypocondriacs), in the region where the person lies down, using a probe,  with three cauteries in this form and this same size.
And let the space between each cautery be the width of a finger, and the cauteries be the length of a right hand.
And do not press the cautery too hard.
And if the amount of the hardened material is half the size of a fingernail, and is no longer to be applied; and if the patient is standing on their feet, and if not, then they should be lying down, with their legs spread, and their arms raised.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much in the cauterization, and that the size of a fingernail is not burned, so that the whole body is burned and reaches the intestines, because the fingernail is thin here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When an inflammation or abscess is in the liver, and you want to know if the abscess is in the liver's flesh or its covering, then if it's in the liver's flesh, the patient experiences severe weight and sharp pain.
And if it's in the liver's covering, the pain is sharp and intense, often making it difficult for physicians to treat.
Therefore, the patient should be turned onto their side; then, probe the location of the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a rag, the shape of which has been shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the core, until healthy tissue appears.
And then treat that according to the treatment of other abscesses until it is healed.
And only that type of cautery, whose use in the art of medicine is well-established, and with which many illnesses have been treated, should be employed; but this, on occasion, is too bold an application to this operation, rather let us leave that to others, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
Of cauterization for pleurisy.
The ancients said that cauterization of the roots of aristolochia for cold pleurisy was effective this way: take a long, dry root from aristolochia, one that is found to be pointed and the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery the area between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck; and with two smaller cauteries below it, slightly angled towards the area below the chin, and with two more cauteries angled slightly downwards between the 5th and 6th ribs, at the back; and another cautery in the middle of the chest; and one on the stomach; and three cauteries at the back; and one cautery in the area between the two shoulder blades, and two cauteries on either side of the chest, underneath the cautery between the shoulder blades.
And you should not burn your hand with the cautery, but rather have the cautery in the open hand, in operation.
And some ancients said that some people use an iron cautery shaped like a ray, and heat it, and place it on the area between the ribs until it reaches the abscess and it drains pus, just as we have described for abscesses of the liver.
But this cauterization is not without risk, for one may accidentally make a fistula in the affected area that will not heal.
Chapter 30.
Of the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat spleen disease with the methods we have described in the section on treatment, and your treatment is not successful, then cauterization in that area can be done in three ways, all of which are correct.  One method is to make three or four longitudinal cauterizations, following the length of the spleen, similar to the shape of the cauterizations for the liver, the method for which has been previously described.
And the distance between each cautery should be about the width of a finger, or a little more; and the method of cauterization should be the same as that described for the liver.
And do not hold your hand with the cautery; and the patient should be lying on their back.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is to apply the cautery using two incisions, a method described in the chapter on muscle dislocations.  Raise the patient's arm that is on the same side as the spleen, moving it from the position they are lying in.
And the raising of the arm should be done along the length of the body, so that the cauterizations are made across the width of the body.
And then, quickly insert the two incisions into that space so that with those incisions the arm on the other side is penetrated.
And then remove the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery using three incisions.
And then you treat the cautery, as long as it has stopped emitting pus after many days, for this is more important than the other preceding things in the cure.
Chapter 31.
Of the cauterization of dropsy.
Cautery is not applied to dropsy but to hydrops, properly speaking.
When you treat dropsy with the methods of treatment we have described in the division, and your treatment does not provide results, then it is necessary to cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and another cautery on the liver, and another cautery on the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the spine, and one cautery on the right side of the foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the severity of the condition.
And then leave the cautery open so that it discharges profusely for a long time.
And you do not evacuate the patient from the treatment near the cautery with what is necessary, so that two intentions are added to it, and it will be hastened by the aid of healing.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be a wedge, similar to the shape of the previous one, and the one used to cauterize the back should be an olive shape, similar to the previous one.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular regions.  Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand again, and do not fully return it, for the yellow water will retreat.
The cautery should be performed in this manner: Then, apply two cauteries to the two thighs, and on each thigh, use a knife-like cautery tip. And the cauteries should be positioned along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and another below the middle of the thigh; and two cauteries on each thigh.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that any remaining water drains from it.
And then treat it with the methods we have described.
Chapter 33.
Of cauterization of the abdominal area.
When the abdominal area is affected by cold and dampness, weakening the digestive and retentive powers within the stomach and intestines, it is treated with appropriate curative methods.  If the patient can endure the cauterization process, exhibiting resilience, then cauterize the area with a large cautery on their stomach, following the previous methods of stomach cauterization. Use a circular cautery and four smaller cauteries in a circle around the navel, using a small, pointed cautery.  Cauterize over the intestines with a large, or two smaller, cauteries.
And if the excess moisture is substantial and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize the area over the intestines and lower abdomen,  applying two cauteries strongly near the stomach and the groin area, for this is a thorough method of recovery with which you should not err.
Chapter 34.
Of cauterization of chronic hemorrhoids.
When chronic hemorrhoids are caused by thick, cold humors or corrupted moisture, and the methods previously discussed are insufficient to cure them, then cauterize with three cauteries on the hemorrhoids below the spine near the coccyx, a small, triangular one and one above the navel, positioned two fingers apart.
And if you fear the patient's stomach is cold, digestion is poor, and the patient's face is inflamed, then cauterize the area over the stomach with a large cauterization tool as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver, and another on the spleen, using a wedge-shaped cautery.  Leave the cautery open for a time, and then treat until healed.
Chapter 35.
Of cauterization of a boil, in preparation for its excision.
When you excise a boil, then you heat the cautery that is shaped like a ray. Then, insert that heated cautery into the excised boil, and continue to hold the cautery until you reach the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if the boils are numerous, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and then treat them with the ointments you prescribe for them until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over a large area, it is more harmful than helpful.
Chapter 36.
Of the cauterization of fistulas that are naturally present in the affected areas.
When nature does not respond to the treatment we have described in its place, and the patient is distressed by this, it should be treated with cauterization.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula that is naturally present in the area behind, and it is old, oozing pus and corrupt moisture, then the best course of action is to probe it carefully and then ascertain the depth of it using the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery iron, which should resemble a ray. And then place that heated cautery iron into the fistula, according to the depth the probe indicated.
And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until those corrupt tissues are burned, once, twice, or three times, depending on your assessment of the necessity.
And be careful not to burn any nerves or veins; or if the fistula extends towards the bladder or intestines, avoid those areas.  Do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you believe it is not deep-seated.
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the matter has been cut away from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.
And if the matter has not been removed, then know that it is deep-seated or in a rotten part of the body, or that it arises from those causes for which a return will come to the affected place.
Chapter 37.
Of cauterization of the stones.
When pain in the stones comes from cold or excessive windiness, and this has caused the patient's loins to become inflamed, then it is necessary to cauterize that area above the stones with a cautery tool, using a small cautery iron for each stone, from which the pain will return.
And strongly cauterize with the second one a little below, so that three aligned cauteries will be produced, and thus they will be more effective in the healing process.
Chapter 38.
Of cauterization of the bladder.
When the bladder suffers weakness and softening due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that part just below the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and cauterize with one cautery iron on the right side, and with another on the left side of it.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the amount of the wound; and cauterize it with one cautery on the lowest part of the wound, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a pointed one, as is the procedure.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the womb.
When cold and humidity enter the womb, and therefore pregnancy is prohibited, and its menstrual flow is corrupted, and its discharge is delayed, and pain results near the time of their occurrence, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, just as we have said regarding cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the lowest point of the wound, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be pointed.
Chapter 40.
Of cauterization of a dislocated ankle.
When mucous humidity is discharged in the area of the ankle, and this causes it to leave its place, and a sign of this is that the joint is elongated over the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it bulges.
Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the ankle area with a circular cautery, after you have marked the area with a probe in the circumference of the displaced part, so that the part falls into the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the same form as that used in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three smaller, olive-shaped cauteries.
And let the cautery be done according to the severity of the entire condition; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes to the area of the hip, and it is caused by cold and moisture, if the patient is not helped by what we have previously said and is still unwell, then you should rid the patient of the thick humours with pungent pills or artificial ones similar to them; and then cauterize the area.
And the method of cauterization in this case is twofold: either with burning medicines, or with fire.
There are two known methods.  One is to cauterize the area of the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries in this shape; and make a good depth with those. And the spaces between each cautery should be the width of a finger, whether the cautery is small or large.
But sometimes the cautery should be placed in the middle area above the hip joint, thus requiring four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize using the circle, the shape of which precedes the cauterization of hip dislocation, so that the circle encompasses and burns the inflammation of the entire joint.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized to the hip and has not spread to the thigh.
But if the pain has extended to the thigh, then cauterize that area with two cauteries on the thigh, over the location where the patient feels the pain; and with one cautery on the calf, about four fingers' width from the outside/lateral side.
And if the cautery is a knife, the depth of the cauterization should be in proportion to the amount of inflammation in the joint.
And if the patient feels the pain has spread to the area near the toes, then cauterize the area where the pain is felt with three or four cauterization points, or more if needed.
And if the patient feels pain below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize that area with a knife cautery.
And be careful in every cauterization not to burn any nerves or major arteries, lest you cause harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have seen others who have cauterized the ankle and, during the cauterization, the leg became inflamed, and swelling reached the foot, which became perforated and corrupted. And then a strong bowel movement occurred, followed by death.
If the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each part according to this method.
And some learned men, concerning the cauterization of a certain type, say this is the method: make a cauterizing tool shaped like a ring of iron, its circumference being half a palm; and let its opening be the size of a date seed or a little less.
And inside that ring, let there be another smaller one; and let the space between them be the size of a pigeon's nut; and let those rings be open in two parts; and let the length of those parts be one or two pigeon nuts, and make those iron bars properly fitted into the rings; and this is its shape:
Then, heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws sparks, and then place it on the affected area of the patient, while the patient lies on their side. And therefore cauterize it with three round cauteries at once.
And then leave it for three days; then apply a plaster with butter and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Says Albucasis:  Oh, children, we have used this type of cautery little, because of the fear of its appearance, and because we have found few who look upon it favorably.
But the best cauteries are those that the sufferer tolerates, and which find the location of the affliction.
But cauterization with adhering medicines is when you make two circles, having an instrument perforated through which you place the iron rod; let the length of the wall, in its height, be two nuts or wedges.
And if the spaces between each are the thickness of a finger; and they are open below and above, and they are to contain each other in this form:
And then place the ill person lying on their right side on the affected area, and put your hand on the affected area; and then take warm water and place it between the two circles, and let the heat be gradual, using small fire, and hold it for about an hour, and let the patient endure the burning and the cauterization—because that burns like fire—until the burning stops.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wash away the warm water from the entire affected area with fresh water.
And then leave it for three days and apply a bandage until the blackness of the burn remains, and leave it for several days, and the pain will diminish; this is the final remedy.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, apply a poultice containing water, similar to what was done for the affected area.
And this is the method of applying warm water, and I have already written about it in my treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take a portion of alkali and a portion of quicklime, each one part, crush them, and place them in a new pot whose bottom has a small hole, proportionate to the size of the wound.
Place another unglazed pot underneath the bottom of the first pot. Pour some fresh water over the alkali and quicklime, adding it drop by drop.  Then, use your hand to gently compress the mixture until the water dripping from the top pot into the lower unglazed pot becomes clear.
Then collect all that water and pour it over fresh quicklime and alkali,  because it will now be very strong in its effect, a quality used in many medical procedures and cauterizations of other parts of the body, for this process acts like fire.
Some of these medicines used for cauterization include, for example,  teas, honey, and lime with a pleasant taste, mixed together.
And Galen recounted the story of an ancient man's procedure and cure for pain in the loins and sciatica, and praised it highly, saying it required no further treatment, and because he was healed in one go, as he reported, because this remedy in a bath was very easy and quickly effective for this condition.
And it should be taken from a fresh green plant, or if green isn't available, use fresh figs;  it should be crushed with a little bit of ground pepper and placed on the area of pain in the loins, or thigh, or leg, and bound.
And leave it on for three hours, or until the patient feels relief from the burning sensation.
And then put him in a bath, and when his body is warmed, place him on the ground, for the pain will cease and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with these remedies except after the body's evacuation.
However, already Esculapius said that when a vein constricted by a goat's tendon is cauterized, it helps him considerably; and the cautery should be done in this way: take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it between the points of the foot and the bone.
Then take a dry goat's tendon, and burn it in a fire until it is charred; then place it on the wool and leave it until it is spread out. And repeat this, and do not stop doing this until the feeling of the bite reaches the bone and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of goats.
Chapter 42.
Of cauterization for pain in the two [extremities].
Sometimes pain in the back is caused by various things, such as blows or falls or excessive discharge, and by similar causes, by the infusion of cold and damp matter.
And cautery is only useful in this particular kind of pain, which is caused by the effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary to first evacuate the patient with pills and similar remedies, then cauterize the affected area of the back, making three lines along its length.  Place five or more cauteries on each line, according to the patient's tolerance and the strength of the treatment.
And cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if desired, cauterize with three or four cauteries, using a medial wedge-shaped cautery, following this method:
Chapter 43.
Of cauterization at the beginning of a boil/swelling.
Many times this illness affects young children; and a sign of its onset in children is that it causes discomfort in their joints and stiffness and difficulty in movement.
And you find that the posterior vertebra of the back and the ribs of the child are already beginning to protrude over the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and want to stop it, then cauterize that area with a cautery iron that is round, following this shape: that encompasses the entire vertebra with the cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery two or three times. And let the punctures be close together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered to swellings caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter XLIV.
Of cauterization for gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that are spread throughout each part of the body, and when pain arises in the feet, it is customarily called gout by physicians.
And therefore, if gout caused by cold is treated with other methods of healing and the pain does not subside, then cauterize it.
And you cauterize that area around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And it is an olive cautery, of which this is the method:
And if it is necessary to make punctures on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries from all sides using this olive cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize the area, but do not press your hand too hard with the cautery beforehand, but only around the shape of the affected area.
And if the pain ascends to the knee and the thigh, then administer the cautery that we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands, and it is called "suagra," then puncture around the joints in the way they are bending, punctuate on those two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture around the joints on each finger and on the wrist.
And if the pain spreads over several days to the thighs or muscles, then cauterize the affected areas from all sides.
And do not abandon the patient to a good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is removed by this cautery, the patient will be cured, God willing.
Chapter 45.
Of the cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines protrude before the hernia in the groin area, and this happens gradually, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to stop eating for a day and to use soothing remedies so that the rupture descends from its place within the abdomen.
And then hold the patient between your hands on their torso, and instruct them to hold their breath until the hernia or intestines are fully expelled.
And then return it [the protruded part] with your hands and gently press the rupture against the pubic bone, using a circular motion on the portion of the rupture similar to half a circle in the lower part of the body.
And then apply the cautery, which has this form:
until it is very red and emits sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already separated the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another attendant is on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery over that mark with your hand holding the cautery steady, and press it until you grasp the bone of the kneecap (or tendon) in the middle of the joint; and repeat this a second time if you have not grasped the bone in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the intestine during the cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine and cause the patient to die or suffer another serious harm.
And know that if you do not grasp the bone with the cautery, your procedure is not successful.
The cautery for children should be subtle, according to their size and measures.
And then treat the cauterized area for three days with ointment until the scar from the fire is healed.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the area and the wound are sealed.
And you must regulate the patient's diet according to the duration of their treatment, which will support their abdominal recovery and prevent the intestines from pushing out during the healing process.
And when approximately 40 days have passed, then administer a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another 40 days.
And abstain from strenuous work, overeating, and excessive drinking, and loud voices, for if they follow this treatment regimen, they will be completely healed.
And I will now describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, and if it begins and you want to prevent it from recurring, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery, commensurate with its size, and the area should be dried as much as the third part of the whole is. And then, treat it as previously described, and it is well-suited.
And some earlier practitioners would say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, following this shape, since it is marked with a probe:
and a line is drawn across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it;  and place your hand with a wedge-shaped cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
Of the cauterization of twisting (or torsion).
When pain persists in some limb due to a blow or impact, and that pain persists for a long time and you don't find a cure with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be for each limb according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the twist and the pain in it.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains to be punctuated in the limb closest to the affected area, so it is necessary to continue cauterizing until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Of the cauterization of leprosy.
Some lepers are greatly helped by cautery, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize that person, consider if the leprosy is recent and can be cured by what we have said in the division and not otherwise; and if you fear that the corruption encompasses the entire body and constitution of the patient, then cauterize the affected area on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second lower down, between the forehead and the hairline; and two more on the temples; and one at the back of the neck or nape of the neck.
And finally, press the cautery slightly into the bone to create a small indentation, so that the expulsion of thick vapors is relieved; and cauterize on the spleen as necessary.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is evident, then you should cauterize with the cauteries previously mentioned for the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on both cheeks, and two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the vertebrae near the kidneys, and one on the kidneys themselves, and two on the ribs, one on each rib, and two on the elbows, and one on each elbow, and two on the thighs, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of each foot; cauterize the affected areas on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of the feet, and on the hollows of the hands.
And be careful of the nerves that are near the heels, so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes a cautery is applied to the hip bone, another to the mouth of the stomach, and another to the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more beneficial and helpful it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as they do with lancets, because the patient's body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small, according to the affected limbs and joints, as was previously described in the types of instruments.
And then treat the cauterized area with flour of barley cooked with honey, and with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On cauterization for numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep, and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb.
And let your cautery enter the skin a little bit. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes numbness affecting the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the spine, and the nerves which innervate that limb are cauterized, and the numbness is removed.
But do not presume on this unless you are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the pathways of the nerves which move the entire body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of albaras (which is morphea).
When albaras is old and no medicinal ointments help, then cauterize it with a cautery, pressing it slightly according to the amount of the disease's severity until the whiteness and the discoloration are removed, and its color is changed.
And then treat it with flour of barley and lentils mixed with rosemary oil and with leaves of arnica, and with a part of pigeon's blood or swallow's blood, all mixed together.  Then apply a linen cloth and place it over the area until healed.
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, in the way it is curled.
And the learned ones say it should be cauterized with the back cautery in the middle; but I do not see it this way, for I fear it might become ulcerated, and I have seen this a number of times before.
And it is more appropriate that it be cauterized in a circle around it, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 11.
Of the cauterization of malignancies.
When some malignancy is delayed in maturation, and this is due to the excess of its formation, or the patient's age, as they are old and decrepit, with little blood, or due to the length of time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the malignancy; then cauterize in a circle around it with many small pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for this will hasten its maturation.
But if you want its perforation with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, whose form is this:  and place it in the middle of the malignancy until it penetrates the core.
And if the cautery is in that place which is lower, so that the arm's condition is relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Of the cauterization of a corrosive (or eating away) condition.
A corrosive is a wandering corruption in the limb, which corrodes it as if fire consumed dry wood.
Therefore, if this corrosive is in a place suitable for cauterization with fire, then use cauterizing irons, small ones in some cases, and larger ones as appropriate for the area where the corrosive is located.
And then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate all the corrosion and no trace of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply dressings of crushed herbs mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scabs are gone and all the corruption is eradicated.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if, after three days, healthy flesh has grown where there was no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas.
And sometimes a corrosive medicine is used, for it serves as a substitute for cauterization. But however, cauterization with fire is a more immediate remedy.
And I have already discussed the treatment with sharp medicine in the division, therefore take it when you need it.
Chapter 53.
Of cauterization of ulcers and other similar afflictions.
Many times in the parts below the afflicted foot, an ailment called an ulcer develops, a deep, gaping wound, which weakens the foot.  Cauterization in these cases is done in two ways:  cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire involves igniting a concave cautery, resembling a small burning spoon, made of iron, fitting the size and shape of the ulcer's entire area, with fine edges.
Then place this ignited cautery on the ulcer, and gently rotate your hand with the cautery around the ulcer until the cautery reaches the depth of the ulcer. And leave it for three days until it begins to heal. Then apply a poultice made of crushed wild mallows and salt, and leave the poultice on it for one night, for this will eradicate the ulcer from its roots.
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if this does not work, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you must administer cauterization with water.  Take a cannula made of bronze, iron, or even a piece of vulture bone, and place it over the ulcer.  Then, pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand. Rotate the cannula, pressing firmly around the ulcer's edges, so that the hot water reaches the root of the ulcer. Allow the patient to endure the hot water for an hour, then remove the cannula; for the ulcer, with its roots, will be eradicated.
And thus do with these, and then with the others, until all those affected by the ailment on the body are treated.
And then treat those wounds where the roots of the ulcers have been eradicated with ointments that generate new flesh.
Chapter 44.
Of cauterization for tremor.
When someone has tremor due to cold in the nerves, or due to a cold fever, or some similar cause, then it is necessary for you to cauterize that person with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, using an olive-oil cautery.
And the tremor subsides in them, hastening the recovery from the cold illness.
Chapter 45.
Concerning cauterization for white spots (or blemishes) appearing on the body.
When white spots or pustules appear on the body, and these are caused by thick, corrupted matter; then, as soon as they appear, it is necessary to cauterize the opening (or affected area) with a thin cautery made of myrtle wood, the tip of which is heated; or with the roots of a long-stemmed herb; or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes, cauterization is performed at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner; and they are not allowed to develop, and the excess is broken up by these means, and healed.
However, this must be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
Chapter LVI.
On the cauterization of accidental blood flow through an arrow wound.
Many times, an arrow wound is incised toward the ulcer, which extends outward, or towards the incision of an abscess or cauterization of the limb, and similar cases, and it is difficult to stop that.
Therefore, if this happens to someone, then you should press with your hand on the opening of the arrow wound, and place your index finger over it, pressing it repeatedly until the flow of blood beneath your finger is stopped and it does not flow out.
Then place the small and large olive-shaped cauteries, several of them, in the fire, and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then, take one of those [cauteries], small or large, depending on the location and the wound where the artery is broken, quickly placing it over that vein after you have stopped the flow with your finger, and hold the cautery until the blood is cauterized and constricted.
And if the blood is expelled from the artery's opening when you remove your finger and remove the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from among those prepared in the fire, and thus do not stop doing this one after another until the blood is constricted.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is here, and that another harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to constrict the blood, especially if the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction if it is not already extracted, for when it is extracted, the extremities of the patient are most often burned, and the blood is constricted, or it is bound with a thread or bandage with a strong constriction, or that medicines whose virtue is to constrict the blood are placed upon it; and they are pressed with a pillow with a proper constriction.
However, whoever administers proper constriction with bandages and with constriction with cloths or by applying burning substances and similar things, does not succeed quickly.
But if this befalls someone and the physician is not present, nor medicine, then act with careful application of the finger on the opening of that vein as we have said, and aim for a great constriction there until the blood is stopped from the main part of the wound, and the finger does not leave the artery; and above the artery, it should be sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and consider whether cautery or medicine is needed.
Of incisions and perforations, and cupping, and phlebotomy, and wounds, and their like.
We have already discussed in the first chapter all illnesses in which cautery with fire is appropriate, along with burning medicines, and the occasions and causes of it, and the necessary instruments with the forms of cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the supremacy of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker of this will be relieved of that which they have asked for.
And before I begin this, children, you must understand that in this chapter, it is similar to the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of this, great caution is required, for in the operation described in this chapter, evacuation is often achieved, which involves blood loss—the lifeblood being at risk—by the opening of a vein, or incisions on an abscess, or the opening of a wound, or the cleansing of a plague, or the extraction of an arrow, or the removal of a stone, and similar procedures. And all of those are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in their hands lies death.
And I warn you, that this should not befall you, because sometimes the ways of men, with their many diseases, can affect you. And some of them are angered by their illness, and death is easy for them,  because of the severity of their illness, and the length of their suffering, and with the illness comes fear, which signifies death.
And of those is the one who gives you their possessions and says, "You are hoping for health," and their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to those who come to you with this affliction; let your caution be greater than your desires and your haste; and do not presume any cause about it except with sure knowledge that verifies this for you, and which leads to a praiseworthy outcome.
Use in the treatment of all your patients prognostication and indication of the path to health, for in this lies your help in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, children, may God inspire your understanding and not withhold guidance and protection from you, for that is in his power.
And I have organized this chapter, distinguishing it by sections, just as the chapter on cauteries did, regarding the treatment of the head to the feet, so that what you seek and need regarding this matter may be made easier for you.
First Chapter.
Of the treatment of water that is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often occurs in children after birth, and when the wet-nurse presses the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it arises due to hidden causes that are unknown.
However, I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those I saw, death followed, and therefore I have considered it a hopeless case in them.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and their head was always swollen until they could no longer support themselves due to the size of their head, and that the moisture continued to increase until they died.
And this moisture is either accumulated between the skull and the bone, or accumulated beneath the bone over the spine.
When the operation involves moisture between the skull and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should cut open the middle of the head with a cut in the width, and the length of the cut should be about two fingers until the moisture flows out.  This is the procedure for draining the fluid (or, perhaps, the "sputum" / "pus").
And if the moisture is more extensive and the abscess larger, then there are two cuts made in this manner:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, a sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head opened on all sides, and the water is squeezed out when you press on it with your hand from all around; this should not be hidden from you. You should cut into the middle of the head with three cuts in this manner:
And then remove all the moisture through the incisions.  Then bind the incisions with cloths and lint.  Then apply wine and oil to the area for the next five days.  Then loosen the bandages and treat the wound with poultices and salves, and bandage the head evenly.  The patient should eat dry foods with little moisture until the affected area is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, where you consider the size of the abscess and the collection of water, for sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left side.  Therefore, make the incision where the abscess and collection of water appear most prominent, and do it in a way that seems best to you.
And be careful not to cut an artery, lest blood flow out and the patient die from that loss of blood with the evacuation of moisture.
Second Chapter.
When there is persistent inflammation or swelling in the eyes or feet, and the usual medical treatments have not been effective, then the final treatment in such cases is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise them if the patient is leaning back, first rub the area with a rough cloth to make the arteries prominent. Then, hold the patient's neck with a cloth and carefully find where the vein pulsates.  These locations, near the ears, often conceal themselves, and are not easily found in all people.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and then cut each one with a sharp surgical instrument, making an incision that reaches the bone, and that is appropriate for the breadth of the head.
And if you wish, insert the instrument under the artery and sever it at the points above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers joined together, for when any vein is incised, blood flows out in a pulsating manner, leaping out with frequent spurts.
But if the artery is not apparent to the touch, then you must measure the distance of three fingers from the ear, and then mark it with a probe, and proceed to the bone.
And the amount of blood that needs to be drawn is about a wine-cup (i.e., approximately 1/4 pint), though it may vary more or less depending on the patient's constitution and the fullness of their artery.
And then consider the wound, and if there remains on the bone any cause of inflammation, then incise that so that a painful abscess does not develop.
And then staunch the wound with lint and bandages of cloth, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When someone experiences a chronic headache or sudden severe pain, due to acrid humidity and the quality within the temples, or if it is a persistent and intense headache that resembles them, and medicine's curative methods don't help,  we have found success in these illnesses through the extraction of arteries in the temples, or cauterization of those, as we have demonstrated.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient shaves the hair which is on the temples; and identify the visible artery in the temple because it is shown to you by its pulsation, and is hidden from except a few men due to the intensity of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's neck should be tightened with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply hot water to the area until the artery becomes clearly visible to you. And then you take the instrument of which this is the shape: And then you carefully scrape the skin with that instrument until you reach the artery; and then you apply heat there and extract it, moving it in various directions, until you pull it free from the skin and expose the tissues below it, from all sides.
But if the artery is delicate, then wrap it with the end of the instrument, and then cut off a portion of it according to the extent to which its ends are stretched and contracted, and there will be no bleeding, because if it is not cut, the blood will not flow completely.
And then evacuate the blood by one to three ounces.
And if the artery is large, then you should tie it in two places with strong double-layered linen or cords, and do not cut it before the wound is healed, lest bleeding ensue.
And then cut away the excess tissue that lies between the two ligaments; and do this either at that time or later.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery, down to the bone, with a knife cautery until the ends are cut, and it will be in the place of the same work.
And it is a better course of action if the patient does not have a fever or is not of a hot temperament; for cautery is of those things that aid in the finalizing of humours, and therefore it is better for a cure.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the area should be packed with old lint, and then gently powdered, and then treated with drying medicines that promote flesh regeneration and with poultices until healed.
And if, while working, a further flow of blood from the artery occurs, then you should attempt to stop the bleeding, either with a cautery or by packing the area with lint, and pressing firmly with your hand until the bleeding is controlled. And if none of those things are available to you, then place your finger over the area until the bleeding is stopped, and apply water of intense coldness to the area until the bleeding subsides, and it is constricted as needed.
And the easiest way to extract an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery, having two knives, since you have marked the two places with a probe, and place each, very hot, until they reach the bone and divide the vein in two places, so that what is between the ends of it is extended, because it is not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of the two knives is essential. However, if the sharpness is less than two knives, it is better, because if it is sharp like two knives close to each other, it will not cut through the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in those places, the heat of the fire is contained there, and the flesh is cut easily.
And this method is better than any other method and more easy.
And the space between the two knives should be the width of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the treatment of the body from acute and acrid humors of the oils.
When the humors are acrid, and the veins on the top of the head are affected, and you find no medicinal cause for the cure, and sometimes the patient's face reddens and feels a crawling sensation on their forehead as if ants were crawling, and the oils in the affected area are weakened, moist, and even the skin is reddened, and the eyelids are inflamed by the acridity of the tears, the ancient physicians were sometimes unsuccessful in their treatment for this condition, and called the cure "unsuccessful".
And you order the patient to shave the hairs on their forehead, and then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead along its length. And if the length of the incision is two fingers wide: one incision should be placed equidistant from the length of the nose, in the middle of the forehead; the second should be placed at a length slightly beyond the movement of the eyelids near the tear ducts; and the third should be on the other side.
And beware of cutting the arteries which are on either side, and keep your hand from continuing the incision on both sides of the jawbones. And if the space of each incision is the quantity of three fingers joined together.
And if you have a prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which you dry the blood.
And then insert the spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the shape of the incision: which is from the temple area to the second incision. Scrape with that the entire membrane that is between the two incisions with the spatula that is over the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then withdraw that spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument called a knife, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that against the flesh adjacent to the membrane, and the blunt edge against the bone, and push that in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision continue along the membrane, and then do this in the middle fissure until the other fissure.
And since a quantity of blood flows out, express the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a bit of old cloth, and place on those powders mixed in wine, oil, and sour wine, and watch that it does not become a hot abscess.
And on the third day, loosen the ligament and administer a large infusion of hot or lukewarm water, and then treat this with basil ointment with bruised oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Of the treatment of sores/wounds by cauterization and the ulcers descending from the parts inside the head.
When in someone there are sharp and continuous cauterizations, and the patient's ulcers are small and extensive, and already the care of them is weakened, and the eyelids ulcerated and the skin around them is damaged, and there is sharp pain and consequent tension in the forehead area, then know by these symptoms that the matter and cauterizations come only from many veins of the parts within the head.
And the best treatment in these cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, a small one by its width (and begin with an incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be until the bone is exposed; and keep your hand away from the temples' edges, which are often inflamed due to chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth, and then fill the two edges of the incision with old cloth or linen. And then cover with powders mixed in wine and oil, so that a painful abscess doesn't form.
And when you see that the abscess has decreased, then you should rub the bone until the flesh starts to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen to promote flesh regeneration, just as if you take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, mix them, and make a poultice from them, which should be applied to these wounds to encourage flesh growth.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of what afflicts the ears.
Every affliction in the ears belongs to one of four kinds: either it's a mineral, or something mineral-like, such as iron or glass; or it's from a plant, like a thorn or bean; or it's a flowing substance, like water and sour wine and their likenesses; or an animal.
And therefore, when a stone or a similar unyielding substance lodges in the ear, and you place the ear in the sun, and if the stone moves, then apply to it some kind of olive oil or resin, and then administer extraction, and make the person sneeze with a condiment, and plug the nostrils during the sneezing episode. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear outward, because often it is expelled by these methods.
And if it isn't expelled, then administer extraction with the instrument called a *gesti epicicarios* (small, pointed, surgical instrument), of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the instrument, good; and if not, then administer extraction with a thin, small spoon (or similar instrument).
And therefore, if it is not expelled by that, then make a copper cannula and insert the end of the cannula into the ear hole and seal around the cannula with softened wax and oil so that only the cannula is open. And then extract with your hand using strong pulling, for often this, as we have recounted, works.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a lighted torch or a suitable device with which birds' nests are captured, and place a small amount of that at the end of the wound, and then wrap a decent quantity of cloth around it. And then gently insert that into the ear hole, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled using all the methods we have described, then you should consider cutting it before it becomes a painful abscess or spasm.
And the method of cutting it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and remove the blood according to its potency, and then make a cut between your hands and turn the ear outward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear towards its fat, in the location firmly held by you. And let the incision be moon-shaped until it reaches the stone, and once the stone is found, remove it if possible with appropriate instruments; and then close the incision quickly and treat it until it heals.
And if the cause festering in the ear is one of the fats that grows and swells, then administer the cure and extraction of it; but if you do not succeed in this way, then you should take a subtle, thin spathe according to this method: And use that to perform the excision of that fat which has festered in the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already softened by the vapor of the ear, and place it in small pieces, and carefully remove them with forceps or with a subtle maneuver, or with an incision as we have described, for this will ease the removal.
However, if water has entered the ear, the patient should initially use sneezing remedies, and fill their ear with old cotton, and lie on the side of the affected ear, and if this forcefully expels the water, good. If not, then take smooth, small stones of the length of a finger, and heat them slightly in the fire, and the patient should insert one of these stones into the ear canal, and step on the foot on that side and strike with another stone against the stone inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water has been expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water has been expelled. And once the water is expelled in this way, you should take paper or linen, and place one end in the ear, and extend the other end with fire until the greater part of it is burned.
And then place more linen there, and do this repeatedly until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula as previously described in the method using the stone.
However, in the extraction of a creature entering the ear, if it is a small creature, such as a tick or the like, treat it in the same way as we have said in the previous section; but if it is a large creature, which appears in the ear canal, then administer the extraction with instruments and hooks, and it is easier to deal with than all the other ailments that occur within the ear.
However, in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said previously in the section on distillations and your treatment doesn't work, then you should expose the ear to the sun's rays.
And therefore, if any worm-like creature appears, extract it with a delicate instrument or hook; but if no creature is visible, then take a cannula that is narrow at the bottom and wider at the top, of which this is the form: Insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then suck forcefully with it, repeating this many times, until all the worms have been expelled.
But if it doesn't respond to this, then you should seal and close the cannula's opening with wax as we've previously described; then administer distillations, which have already been used by ancient healers for treating worms, and you'll find this in the section on distillations.
And let your application of medicinal oils into the ear be with this instrument, whose shape is as follows: Make it of silver or bronze, narrow at the base, with a small hole, and broad at the top.
And thus it should be like a piston within the cannula's cavity, wherever necessary. And if you wish, take the rod and wrap its end properly with cloth, then pour oil into the hollow of the ear, or the juice of any herb, or whatever medicine you want, into the cannula—and that is in the ear—then insert the wrapped rod, and press gently with your hand until the oil is expelled into the cavity of the ear, and the patient feels the oil inside.
And whatever is poured into the ear should first be warmed slightly by fire. And be careful that the substance you are distilling into the ear is not too cold, for ear remedies do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the treatment of ear blockages.
Sometimes, children born with an undeveloped part of their mothers' uteruses and sometimes even grown men, experience ear blockage due to a wound, or an abnormal growth of flesh within it; this blockage sometimes occurs at the entrance of the ear canal, preventing its opening, and sometimes in the external areas around it.
And that which occurs at the entrance, preventing the opening, is in the most difficult circumstances to heal.
And in that which allows the opening, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and observe it. And therefore, if blockage appears, open it with a very thin instrument, of which this is the shape:
If its tip has a small width, with one side sharp and the other not; and the instrument has two thin ends so that it does not damage the ear.
And therefore, if the blockage is due to flesh grown in the ear or its canal, then remove it with fine forceps and cut it away forcefully until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is in the entrance to the ear, then take a thin, fine reed and warm it slightly with fire, then place it in the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have detected a blockage causing difficulty for the patient to hear, relieve the pressure gently, and take care not to damage the nerves of the ear.
Then place a cloth over the ear, sized according to the width of the hole you created, wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's healing, or take some and dissolve it in water and sprinkle the pulverized residue onto it.  If the ear has become inflamed, then you must remove the poultice and replace it with another poultice wrapped in a plaster made from rose oil until the inflammation subsides; and then treat it until it is healed.
However, if bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use other treatments to stop the bleeding, which is described in the treatise on distillations.
Chapter 8.
Of the treatment of a stye that forms on the eyelids.
Styes that form on the eyelids of the eyes sometimes are moist, sometimes are dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or forceps, and carefully cut them away from their roots, and then apply a compress to the area.
But if pain with blood flow occurs, then you should cauterize them with a fine, lens-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is close to the incisions, and sometimes they return when any cause of their roots remains; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often a cause resembling a swelling in its strength and hardness develops in the eyelids of the eyes, and therefore swelling is called.
And it is a buildup of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below.
Therefore, the treatment for them is that you must then consider if the swelling is originating within the eyelid itself and spreads outwards; and the cause of it is mild.
Therefore, make a small incision along its length, then gently scrape it away from all sides until it recedes, and then suspend it with forceps and cut it off.
And if the swelling is large, then you should close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you, for the ointment will restore and heal it.
And if the size is receding towards the inner part of the eyelid from the surface inward, then raise the eyelid, suspend the swelling with forceps, rather than making an incision, and press it from all sides.  And if the eyelid is stretched by an incision, this causes no harm.
And after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and treat the area with something that promotes healing until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a cyst on the eyelid above the eye.
A cyst is a swelling that forms within the tissues of the eyelid above the eye, and it most frequently affects children, making their eyes sore and causing difficulty when they wake up in the morning. They cannot look at the sunlight because of this, as their tears are constantly running down their faces.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, sleeping on their faces; and their eyelids below their eyebrows are damp, and there is a swelling, and a visible tendency towards a boil/abscess appearing in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel a swelling/boil beneath it.
And a method of treatment is that the patient places their head on your lap, and you place a cloth over them and heat it, and make a circle from it according to the size required to enclose the swelling on all sides, and then place that over it and press with your fingers so that the swelling is squeezed into the middle of the circle, and then puncture the middle of that swelling with a lancet, with a slit no larger than the slit made in a bloodletting procedure.
But in the process, you must break open the cyst completely until you reach the swelling, because in most cases the swelling proceeds through a rupture, like a white fat-like substance.
Then extract it with the cloths that you have wrapped between your fingers on the outside edges and rub it between your right and left hand until it has disappeared.
And be careful not to force the opening, so that with the lancet you do not reach the eye and damage it.
But if it does not appear to be swelling at the beginning of the incision, but you push slightly into the opening with ease until the swelling proceeds; then extract it in the way we have mentioned; and then apply cloths dipped in warm water and wine, and place them over the area, and compress them with powders.
And some rub salt and place it in the cavity of the incision, so that any remaining moisture is absorbed.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if you find a hot abscess in the area, then treat it with cooling poultices until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Methods of treating the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths beneath the natural skin and they become hardened, they irritate the eye and cause various illnesses, such as constant weeping and softening of the eyelids and tissues, which ultimately can damage the eye, an ailment called "tactinir" of the eye.  It is treated in four ways: either by cauterization with fire; or with a sharp medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization; or a cauterization is done through incision and stitching; or with probes, as I will explain.
And therefore, you must place the patient's head on your lap; then gently close the eyelid with your left hand.  If it closes easily, good; if not, insert a needle into the part where the growth is, below the eyelid.  Pierce the needle through the growth, close to the edge of the eyelid, near the hairs.  Pull the growth upward, away from the eyelid, and then gently close the eyelid with your fingers.
Then, in the area beneath the eyelid, beneath the hardened growths, make an incision from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.  Remove the growth, and place small, powdered cotton or cloth beneath the eyelid, then press the eyelid down with a probe, forming a shape similar to a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape must be adjusted according to how much the eyelid is raised, because this varies from one person to another. Some need a significant incision of the eyelid, corresponding to the amount of the eyelid's swelling.
And then, use the probe along the two lines you have marked, starting from the larger tear duct and going towards the smaller one. And if the incision is near the natural hairs, make it as wide as the king's finger.
Then, place the forceps on one of the two corners of the wound, and scrape the entire area clean.  Then, using the suture, join the two edges of the wound with fine wool or similar material, and clean the blood.  If you desire, apply whatever excess material you have to the eyebrows with some astringent.  If not, do not bother.
Then, leave the stitches of wool in place for three or four days, and then treat the wound.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches, and treat it with things that dry and constrict, for the eyelid is raised toward the sealing of the wound and its adherence; but stitches are better.  Thus, the ancient practitioners of surgery say this.
But nonetheless, there should be care for the patient, and it is a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
There is another method in surgery, and it is that you make an incision on the eyelid shaped like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three forceps arranged and gathered according to this shape:
But if this is not possible, holding the forceps, and this is not effective, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the shape, and insert the other thread next to the larger tear duct, and the second thread next to the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads equally between those two points. Then, using those threads, elevate the eyelid, raising the entire eyelid along the shape we described.
And then close the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with a poultice and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes the eyelashes of the eyelid become turned inward, in which case you should use what we have described regarding incisions; however, suturing in each case is more artificial.
To treat with canes is according to this method: and it is that you turn the eyelid and cut the figure inside as I have described; and then, artificially, make two thin canes or sticks, whose length should be equal to the length of the eyelid and whose width should be less than the width of the space. And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully attach each [thread] to what is superfluous of the eyelid of the eye, and tightly bind the canes to each part, and leave it for several days, because the flesh will die due to the binding and become rotten and will soften until it falls off by itself.
However, if it has been delayed, then break it with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Therefore, when it is solidified, the eyelid is elevated and the skin does not hurt.
And this is the method for two canes, which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of the length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of lifting painful hairs in the boil with a needle when the hair is hard.
When there are unnatural hairs, hard and harsh, causing pain in the boils, then the operation for them is that you take a fine needle and place it on a fine linen thread or silk, and then you should adjust the ends of it very subtly. And the length of the threads should be about the length of a palm.
And then you should attach another fine thread underneath it quickly, and use the ends of that if you wish.
And then place the patient's head on your lap, and keep it close to the light so your work is clear, for it is a delicate and precise operation.
Then, carefully insert the needle into the root of the attached hair, which needs careful handling, and quickly penetrate the eyelid until you remove it above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair upwards and put it in the tweezers, and there should be one, two, or three hairs, but no more.
Then, using your hand, pull it out until the hair is removed from the eyelid with the tweezers, leaving the natural hair behind.
However, if the tweezers are pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the tweezers downwards with the forceps you have prepared until the tweezers are pulled out of the wound completely.
And then, view the eye, because then you will throw away the tweezers and the forceps, and each person will close and cover the eye, and leave it covered for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and lift it using that, or let it grow until it's a bit longer, and then you lift it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of an injury that occurs on the eyelid above.
When an injury occurs to the eye, and the eyelid is contracted upwards, either to the right or left side, due to poor healing from a wound, incision, or cauterization, and is called a harelip, and this injury or is natural or accidental, and is caused by the poor healing of a wound, incision, or cauterization, or by similar poorly treated wounds.
The method of the operation in this case is that you should break open that scar tissue and separate the edges, and place a piece of soft cloth between them, and tie them together until they are healed.
And it is not appropriate to use treatments that are drying or constricting; for if you do this, it will return the injury to a worse state than before the wound was inflicted.
Use remedies that are softening, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice made of water in which marshmallow root and seeds are boiled, or a diachylon ointment (which has been liquefied with some oil).  Place the cloth in the poultice or ointment and apply this treatment.
And the goal of your treatment is that you should restore the area to the original condition before it became scarred.
And this operation, which we have described, is nothing but a correction of the injury, restoring the area to its former shape.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment for injuries to the lower eyelid.
This injury to the lower eyelid, properly called an injury, can be either natural or accidental in origin.
But accidental injuries are caused by blows, cuts, cauterization, or similar things.
And the way to treat it is to take a needle with double thread, and pierce the flesh with it, passing it from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then, gently pull the flesh outward with the needle and stitch it with the needle, and cut away the surrounding tissue with a wide spatula. And then if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, that is good; but if not, take a thin strip of material and place it in the gap, and use it to reposition the eyelid, closing the two openings on the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two slits, of the incisions you have made, meet, and form an angle where they come together, so the figure is formed by their meeting.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.
And now, remove the flesh to the extent that the sharp edge of the lower eyelid is exposed.
And now, bring the separated parts together and stitch them with wool thread; and then treat them with the softening remedies and poultices we have mentioned, until they heal.
And if it rises again through a fissure, suture, or cautery, then you should make a flat incision on the eyelid skin, following the previous procedure. And now, separate with a poultice between the two lips, as we have said.
In summary, concerning the treatment of a raised (or prolapsed) eyelid, the operation must be performed on the affected person, according to the type of prolapse, and those prolapses take various forms.
And skilled artisans always prepare instruments in every possible way to restore the affected area to its natural, or nearly natural, form.  The patient should be properly positioned for the operation and the instruments should be used with the utmost care.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in such a way that the eyelid is firmly stuck to the white part of the eye, restricting its natural movement and function, you must carefully insert the tip of a tool beneath the eyelid and lift it or gently separate it with a hook.
Then carefully cut the adhesion with a thin blade, avoiding overly sharp incisions, using a blunt edge to minimize discomfort for the patient.  Leave the blade so that it doesn't injure the eye with its sharpness.
And make your incision such that it easily separates the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and all the adhesion is removed.
Then you apply salt water to the eye, using it to wash the eye, or use a solution of honey dissolved in water.
Then gently separate the eyelid from the eye, and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye.  After three days, use healing remedies until it is completely healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of flesh of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two kinds: one is nervous, and it is like hard, fine, crisp material; or it is non-nervous, resembling frozen white moisture, which when the iron touches it, or when forced to be removed by forceps, it is torn away and the forceps do not sink into it.
And both kinds begin only from the major tear duct, little by little spreading to cover the eye and hindering light and the movement of the eye.
But the method of operating on it (the incision) is that the patient rests their head on your lap, then opens their eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand, and then collect the nail with forceps of little bending and extend it to the parts above. And then take a needle and insert into it a hair of a horse or ox or cow, or similar, or strong thread, or gradually taper the needle point and insert that into the middle of the nail, and pierce that with the needle and bind the nail with thread; and extend it to the parts above, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that obstructs the pupil. And thus you follow that with the hair until the back of it.
And then you cut the remaining part at the roots of the tear duct with a fine scalpel or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that by cutting it, there does not develop a continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail, with the simple forceps or with thread, as we have said, and then it is scraped with a lion's scalpel, of which this is the shape of it:
And be careful that with the scalpel you do not touch the cornea and cause a rupture in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then put a little crushed salt or a dry powder made from cinnabar into the wound, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not inflamed and you cannot insert a needle, or it is not lodged in the nail bed, then often this type of nail is cured with medications, and it is healed in the manner as I have recounted in the division.
And if you want to incise it, then you open the wound of the patient and take a sharp, slender lion's scalpel, of this shape: with subtlety. And if it is often rarefied and is filled and absorbed into the root, then distil from your vessel into the wound a dry powder made from cinnabar, or with red cinnabar or crushed salt, and cover the wound until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure on that until everything is removed, unless a hot abscess is in the wound, for then you leave it and cure the abscess at the beginning until it is healed.
Then repeat your procedure on it with reason until it is healed.
If the lacrimal flesh, if you see it in the wound by great damage, is suspended with a bandage; and cut it a little bit, and do not finish the incision so that you do not cut the flow of tears.
Then distil into the lacrimal wound red cinnabar and powder of cinnabar until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the incision of a carbuncle and that which is born of inflamed flesh in the wound.
Sometimes in the wounds of some, red flesh grows, and it overgrows until it covers the pupil, or is close to or tightens on the eyelids, and strongly presses the eyelids on the outer edges, and resembles the redness of a balustrade.
But the operation on him is that the patient places his head on your lap; then open his wounds and collect all that flesh with suitable forceps, and hold it with a forceps or shears; and then cut the flesh from the beginning until everything is finished with the lancet, and be careful not to damage the wound during your operation.
And your incision should be made with the instrument used for cutting or with a scalpel, as described in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors, with which the abscess is collected, as will be shown in the form of this chapter.
Then, once your incision is complete and all that flesh has been removed, fill the wound with crushed salt, or put in a red powder similar to corrosive medicines, and place a bandage made of white of egg over the wound until it is safe from a harmful boil.
And if some lingering cause of inflammation remains and a harmful blood clot is feared, then leave the wound and treat that boil with what will lessen the boil, and then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.  Similarly, treat the inflamed flesh that forms in the wound of this kind.
However, you should avoid any treatment of the wound by natural or accidental means, using iron, and do not place your hand on any of these operations until you see that the limb is enduring the operation.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of pus from the wound.
Pus comes from red, thick substances covering the wound, and prevents its operation, and keeps the wound open for many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the wound containing pus is strong and has no other illness besides pus, then you collect the pus.
And you instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and then you suspend those veins with a bandage or two, according to your judgment; and that bandage should be made of thin layers in this way:
or two bandages gradually on one side according to this form:
And then those veins should be gathered gently, subtly, and the blood should be wiped away hour by hour, until you see those veins have receded from the wound and are rolled back.
And be careful not to damage the wound with the edges of the spatula; and if your operation is in the midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation that you only cut the veins.
And when you have finished, then you apply a green or red liquid to the wound so that, with its sharpness, it corrodes that which is remaining from the ulcer.
But if that is not possible for you to collect at that time, then you cover everything with something that relieves his pain, and leave it for several days until the pain subsides and a hot abscess is assured.
And then repeat this according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the method of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of a nasal injury/fracture.
When you treat a fracture with cautery or a sharp, burning medicine, and the narrative of it precedes, and it is not healed, then there is no use in applying it; instead, make incisions into the abscess, after it has matured, and remove all the moisture and pus until the bone is exposed.
And therefore, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness on it, then you scrape it with a tool whose shape is as follows:
And it is called a "sharp head," and it is made of iron, and the head is round, like a nut, which is pierced with a file or a fine pointed instrument (as shown in the following image).
And place that on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, and gently press with your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And do this several times, then restore the area with desiccated and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated and has good flesh grown over it, and the body is free from pus and has remained this way for 40 days, and is not renewed or suppurated and does not have further accidents, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then it is not a case of healing, but of reducing the fissure to the shape of the nose, and in this way: and you must expose the second bone with iron or with a sharp medicine, and when you have exposed the bone, then you take a piece of tissue in this way:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and the shaft be thin and tapered to the tip like this (or a similar depiction of a shape).
Then place that on the bone, and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand a little from the hole, and then rotate your hand with the piece of tissue until it penetrates the entire bone, and the patient will feel it because air will escape when you move your hand.
Therefore, then restore the area with astringent drying medicines, as you have been taught.
Therefore, when the flesh has healed and the area is hardened, then the matter which was spreading outward returns to the nose, thus making it easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the eminence of the hole/opening.
When the swelling emerges fully and you do not encounter any harmful occurrence or diminution in its appearance, then you should leave the patient alone, and then follow up, and then apply leeches to the neck without incision and draw them for a good suction; then apply a liniment to the swelling made of elecampane, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and then firmly bandage the poultice onto the swelling with many powders.
The method for the powders is to take fine linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make many of these.
And then place these one upon another according to the amount the swelling requires. And then bind them together with a strong, hard cloth; and repeat the leeches with suction without incision; and then remove the leeches and leave the swelling bound tight day and night.
But if, meanwhile, the swelling has softened, then it should be tightly bound.
And then remove the bandage at approximately the same time every day and night, as we have said.
And if the swelling has already been reduced, that is good, and if not, then repeat the poultice with the powders and the binding and the leeches until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the choroid layer.
When a rupture occurs in the choroid layer, and it is prominent and protrudes outside the eyelids like a bunch of grapes, and the shape of a person is thus impaired, and you wish to incise it, then the procedure in such a case is as we have described, that you insert the needle into the root of the choroid from the lower part to the upper part, and then insert another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal side, and make that one penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; and then, you incise the area with the double thread and lift with it the portion of the choroid in the area around the needle, and tighten that greatly.
And then withdraw the needle and place over the swelling wool soaked in egg white and leave until the thread comes away with the grape-like protrusion.
And then treat the swelling with this, providing comfort until the wound is healed.
And sometimes, by gathering from all sides with a cloth circle to keep the large swelling contained, it is then pierced with a slender spit that reaches the base of the swelling, and the albuminous moisture flows out, and the swelling descends and subsides quickly.
And then hold it firm until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of hawks.
This illness, called "alconati," is nothing but a fluid collected in a swelling, resembling descending water, but it is not that.
But the method of treating it is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, and then take their head in your two hands and hold it steady until you see the fluid coming down the lower parts, and then it should be dried and not descend any further, and the light should be cut off, and the patient should see the causes as if they were seeing them.
And if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
However, if the descent of the fluid is not prepared as we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands and then take fine, thin spittle and apply it to the inflamed area (a small area along the juncture of the conjunctiva and the cornea, in the region of the corneal crown), until the fluid is expelled.
Therefore, when it is expelled, then you instill warm water into the swelling, in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of the fluid descending from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of fluid in the division, and which ones are appropriate to pierce with a lancet, stating the reason, then according to the health.
Now you must place the patient between your hands on a bed, and firmly bind the patient's eye shut.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their eye if the eye with the fluid is the left eye; or with your right hand if the eye is the right eye.
And then, with your right hand, take an almond, if the eye is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right eye.
And then place the tip of the almond near the eyelid, at the thickness of the ray, on the white of the eye, on the side of the smaller tear duct, and then gently press on the almond and rotate your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has now reached the hollow cavity.
And it should be that the distance of the almond from the tear duct is the same as the distance from the pupil to the edge of the black area, which is the eyelid; for you will see the pupil through the clarity of the cornea with the eye's vision.
And then place the almond into the area where the fluid is, and then pull it down a few times, and if the fluid descends immediately, then you see the patient looking at what they're looking at, and the almond in their eye.
And then rest a little; if the fluid has descended, then you hold it a little longer before the almond is expelled.
And so, when it is dry and does not descend, then you extract the almond easily, and turn it with your hand slowly, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the fluid and wash the eye with it; and then place a bandage of cloth or a stopper or wool soaked in heated oil and egg white on the eye and bind the eye with it.
But we and those of our time place a bandage of this type over it mixed with egg white.
And if you are unable to insert your almond into the eye due to its hardness—for some people's eyes are very hard—then you should take the spatum, which is called "alberid," and it has this form:
And then pierce the conjunctiva with it, and do not press your hand into the hole, but merely make a subtle path for the almond.
And then insert the almond as we have said.
And the completion of your work should be prepared in the patient's sleeping quarters, carefully arranged so they sleep on their back in a dark room, and any movement should be prohibited.
And place that upon him so that his nature is calmed, and do not turn his head to either the right or left at all.
And the ligature should remain in place according to its position until the third day.
And then remove that in that dark room and deprive him of the light, and make him see some things, and then return the ligature until the seventh day.
And you should not do this during the time of treatment or immediately after the infusion. Having this, you must do this so that the water can easily pass through with great and vehement care/attention.
However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to remove the dressing before the seventh day, and treat it with what will cause the abscess to subside.
Then you remove his sight and place a covering over his face through which his vision will be directed downward for several days, him remaining in the dark room.
And then be gradually released from that room and restored to his/her senses.
And know that in a difficult case, the student is not excused from performing some observations, and then you must be resolute in the operation.
And it has been reported to us by some of those who are in Artach, and some said that a fire was made in Ayrac, a large opening through which the water was drawn out.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor is it found in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that this is something new.
And these are the forms of the species of magdaam so that whoever is unfamiliar with them might know them:
And they are made of iron or steel properly, and their extremities have this triangular sharpness, the pointed end in such a way that this is the form.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
When various flesh growths arise in the nose, some of which are caused by something resembling a scorpion's tail or a fish's polyp; and this illness is called polyp because it resembles that depicted fish. And some of it is cancerous, ulcerated, of a dark color; and some of it is lion-like flesh, not dark in color.
Therefore, in those flesh growths that are not fraudulent or cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands and place them in the sun, and clear the patient's nostrils and then pierce the growths with your lancet. And then extract the growths outward, and then cut away what you have grasped of them with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; if any part remains from which excision is possible, then you should cut that part away with a thin instrument until nothing remains. But if it is accompanied by blood or a hot abscess, then you apply what is appropriate; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you cauterize and cut it until the blood is removed and all cavities are open.
And then, after the incision, put some vinegar and water or wine into the nose. But if the nose is open and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as expected, then you know that inside there is still corrupted flesh, or excess pus, on the bones of the nose to which the excision has not reached.
Therefore, you should insert a piece of wool, which has some thickness, and use many pieces, placing a quantity of the finger or less between each piece.  And then, gently introduce one end of the wool into the nose with a stick or other suitable means.
And after that, draw the wool's odor inwards until it reaches the channels of the nose, and has come out onto the throat.  For, many times children do similar things in school, and it is an easy task for the one who desires to do so.
Then, place the two ends of the wool, one end coming out of the nose and the other remaining inside, and then apply a flesh-cutting instrument using the wool pieces, continuing until you know that the flesh is now intertwined with the wool.
Then remove the wool, and place a poultice over the area of the nose, near where the blood was drawn, and continue this for three days or more until the poultice has corroded all remaining flesh.
And finally, place a lead tube in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you need a more thorough cure, use this one.
And this is the shape of the nasal cautery instrument, with which oils and medicines are instilled into the nostrils:
And make it of silver or bronze, shaped like a small, open lamp or a tiny shell, and similarly shaped with a narrow passageway.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed, and the tube of the nasal cautery instrument should be flat, open; to which there is a handle at the back, with which you hold it when you heat oil or whatever juice or subtle substance you wish in it.
Chapter 25.
Of ulcers on the nostrils' extremities.
Often an ulcer appears on the extremities of the nose, and it grows and worsens in some days until its sight is extremely painful.
And therefore, you should incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it. And then place a cautery or a burning medicine on the area.
However, if its incision is delayed until it has grown, then consider if it is hardened, hard, of dark color, and with little sensation.  Then do not touch it with iron, for it is a deep-seated abscess; for often the one who incises this abscess brings great harm upon the person it was on.
And if the abscess is tender and not dark-colored, and sometimes incision is possible throughout, then drain the patient and incise it without fear, and treat the area with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when the continuity is dissolved by plague or similar ailments.
Know that when you encounter a break in continuity in one of these cartilages, you achieve little in that procedure except in certain individuals.
Therefore, when you encounter any of those causes, consider whether it's a fresh plague wound with its own blood, and if so, you should bring the two lips of the wound together with sutures, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the edges of the break in continuity are already separated, and each is made sound, then you must scrape each part of their visible skin until blood comes out. And then bring the two edges together with sutures, and tightly bind them.  Powder the area with dragon's blood and crushed herbs, and place a piece of diaphanous plaster, or another of the consolidating plasters, on top of the powder.  Leave this dressing for two or three days, and then remove it and replace the plaster.  Leave it until the pus is gone, then continue treatment with ointment until healed.
But the method of suturing is that you rejoin the break in continuity either with needles, as we have described in suturing the belly, or join the break in continuity with adhesive, as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the removal of those things that come between the two edges of the inside parts.
Often, men develop hard abscesses resembling kernels of grain within the interior parts of their lips. Some of these are small, and some are larger.
Therefore, you must turn back the lips and open up each of those hardnesses from every side, and then, after the excision, fill the area with crushed sage until the blood is stopped, then wash the area with sour wine and treat the area with something astringent until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of the flesh adhering to the gums.
Often, fleshy growths form on the gums, which the ancients called "albulus".  In that case, you should suspend it with forceps or hold it with scissors, and cut it away from its base, allowing the pus or blood to drain.
And then apply crushed sage or other astringent or drying powders to the area.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for the cautery will prevent it from returning.
Chapter 29.
Concerning toothache with a metal instrument.
When on the surface of the teeth, both on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, hard, and sometimes black or yellowish scabs form, causing a corruption of the gums and making the teeth sore.
Therefore, you should place the patient between your hands, resting their head on your knee, and scrape the teeth where those scabs and similar things like grit appear until no trace remains.  Do this to remove the blackness, yellowing, and other discolorations until they are cleaned.
So if you have removed what was initially targeted in the procedure, good.  If not, then repeat the procedure on those areas the next day, and the following, and the third, until you achieve the desired result.
And know that teeth require many different types of scrapers and shapes, depending on how your procedure is set up. And therefore, the scraper used to clean the inside of the tooth is different from the scraper used to clean between the teeth, with other shapes, and these scraper shapes are for you to prepare, which you will see soon:
Chapter 30.
Of the removal of teeth.
You must treat the tooth's pain with all care and take your time in every removal of it, for there is no cause that outweighs its extraction when it is removed, for it is a subtle substance, until its expulsion during removal.
However, when the patient insists on having that tooth removed, you must be firmly certain which tooth is diseased, for many times the pain deceives the patient and seems to be in a healthy tooth, and you remove that one, and the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is removed, for we have already seen this through the barbers' operations.
Therefore, how should you be certain which is the diseased tooth, and that you know it well?  Then you must scarify the area around the tooth with a substance which has some effect, until the tooth is separated from the gum on all sides. Then carefully remove it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, little by little, until it is extracted.
And then, if necessary, use strong forceps for a good grip or powerful extraction, and place the patient's head between your knees so you hold it firmly, and then pull the tooth straight, in such a way that you don't break it, or give the patient undue pain.
And therefore, if it is not easily extracted, then take one of those instruments and place it under the tooth from all sides with ease, and exert the extraction just as was done at first.
However, if the tooth is fractured or decayed, then you must cover that cavity with cloth and compress it with a thin, pointed instrument so that it is not fractured during your attempt to remove it with forceps.
And you must carefully open up the area around the gum with incisions on all sides, and be very careful in your strength so you don't break it and leave a piece behind, and return to the patient for the bad luck it could cause, which might be worse than the initial pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their rashness and boldness regarding the removal of teeth, without observing what we have recommended; for very often they cause great illnesses in people, illnesses more difficult to treat than the original problem, and the roots remain, some or all of them, or they pull out the tooth with part of the jawbone, as we have frequently witnessed.
And after the extraction, wash the mouth with hot wine or sour wine with salt.
And if bleeding ensues, as often happens, then apply a small amount of lint and sprinkle it over the wound; and if that doesn't stop the bleeding, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and fine pliers used to remove the tooth initially should be long-ended, with a short, thick handle, so they don't bend when you use them.
And they should be like that, with a thick handle, so that when you grip them, they don't bend; the ends should be short.
And they should be made of Indian iron, well-made with straight ends, and on the ends of those there should be teeth of which one fits into the other and grip tightly by constriction.  Sometimes the ends of those are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, or a type of crane, and are very strong in their constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the removal of teeth and the extraction of bones from fractured jaws.
When you must remove a tooth that is fractured, leaving some cause, then you should place a compress with wool on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; and then use forceps or pliers, the ends of which are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork or crane, the shape of forceps:
The ends of them should be made pointed like a file or a rasp.
And if you cannot remove it with these forceps or pliers, then you must carefully dig around the root and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument called a small lever, the shape of which is this:
And it should have a short, thick end, a little bit, and not be overly sharp so it won't break.
So, if the root is thereby dislodged, good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the shapes: the shape of the first instrument is triangular in shape, with some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and with a more slender tip.
And now, having been assisted with this instrument, having two ramps, of which this is the shape below: and with other instruments, which I will describe, for the purpose of scraping teeth; for scraping is effectively done with this instrument which resembles a large spoon, and this is its shape:
of triangular, bent, or short shape, with some thickness, and not being hollowed out so that it is not broken.
And you should know that the instruments for the teeth are very similar to the other instruments.
But a skilled and subtle craftsman in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and the various illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not prescribe nor devise a specific instrument, due to the diverse forms of the illnesses.
But if the bone of the jaw or other bones of the mouth are fractured, or if there is a poyreys (a dental abscess or similar affliction), then apply a suitable dressing to that area in its proper location with what is convenient from among the instruments and forceps that we have described in the extraction of tooth roots, and help with a maneuver whose form is:
And there should be some small, gradual pressure applied, and it should be held or compressed with the mouth so that it does not escape or leak until the bone is completely set; and then restore the area with appropriate medicines.
But if there is a small abscess on the bone, then remove that abscess and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth prominent above the others.
When teeth are prominent and do not follow their natural course due to irregularities in their form, especially in women, and particularly in venerable young women; therefore, you must consider: if a tooth is close to another tooth, and no cutting or binding is possible, then extract that one; but if it is not connected to another tooth, then you should cut it with this instrument, which has the form of a pig's snout, and is made of Indian iron with a very sharp end.
And your incision, with which you cut it in several days because of the tooth's hardness, and so it is not connected to the other teeth.
And if a prominent tooth is exposed for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:
And it should be entirely of Indian iron, and easily sharpened; and it should have many small points, just like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that another tooth is not connected and broken. And then bind it at the end, and pull it out with some razors.
And if a tooth is broken in a way that injures the tongue, then you must file it until the roughness of the fracture is removed and smoothed, and it is filled so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of broken teeth with gold or silver filings.
When accidents to the front teeth result in a concussion and displacement due to blows or impacts, and the patient cannot hold onto what is missing, and you have treated this with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then, because they do not hold, the missing parts are best filled with gold filings, not silver, for silver turns green and can corrode in a few days, but gold never changes.
And the filings should be of such a fineness and thickness according to the amount needed to fit between the teeth; and the method for filling is to take the filings and place twice their amount between two healthy teeth, and then to shape them with two twists of the filings between the broken teeth, whether one or several, until the material reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the binding process back to the point where you began, and press your hand with gentleness and skill until it is no longer broken.
And make sure your binding with which you hold the filings adheres firmly to the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose.
And then cut off any excess filings with forceps or scissors, and shape them in each place, and position them, concealing them between the healthy and broken tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightly bound as it remains.
But if it is loose or broken, bind it or them with more filings in such a manner at all times.
And this is the method for teeth, and the technique for the joining of two healthy teeth and two broken ones, in this way when they are joined:
And when it is done that a tooth or two returns to the alignment of each in their places, and are rejoined as we have described, and remain.
And only skillful and knowledgeable artisans can do this.
And sometimes a piece of ox bone is suitable, shaped like a tooth, and placed in the gap where the tooth is missing, and bound as we have said, and remains, serving in that place for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the inflammation of the ligament that affects the tongue and hinders speech.
This ligament, which sometimes lies beneath the tongue, is either natural, present from birth, or accidental, resulting from a wound that has healed.
And the treatment for it is to open the patient's mouth, with their head supported by you; lift their tongue, and then carefully cut the nerve ligament along its length until the tongue is released from its restriction.
However, if there is any hardness or knotting in it, caused by a healed wound, then you apply a poultice and cut it along its length until you have severed the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful not to make a fissure in the underlying flesh, and that you don't cut too deeply and cause a flow of blood.
Then wash the area of the incision with warm water or vinegar or cold water; then place a linen pad under the tongue. This is a bandage that the patient should wear under the tongue every night so that it doesn't heal again.
But if blood flows, apply powdered vitriol to the area; but if the bleeding persists, cauterize the area with a suitable, rounded cautery. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the removal of a ranula (cyst) under the tongue.
Sometimes, a boil similar to a small pouch forms under the tongue, hindering the tongue's natural function; and it grows large, filling the mouth.
And the procedure is to open the patient's mouth, sitting facing the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark in color, or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in that area, then do not touch that, for it is cancer.
And if it has turned whitish, in which there is moisture, then you put a lancet in place and cut it with a fine scalpel, and dissect it from every side; and if blood appears during your operation, then place crushed alum, that is to say, vitriol, on top to stop the bleeding.
And then return to your work until you have extracted it completely, until it has been washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of abscesses from the ears, and from those that are in the throat, and from other abscesses.
When an abscess develops in the throat, these are glands that are swollen together, which burst open and are called ear abscesses; when you treat them with what we have said in the previous sections and it does not heal, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive.  In that case, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is reddish in color and the root is large, then do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then either you will drain it or it will break open on its own.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is subtle, then it is the one that should be incised.
And the procedure for it is that you consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already rested and calmed down or if it has diminished in some way; and then have the patient sit in the sun, with their head on your lap, and open their mouth, and let the attendant place their hands on the patient's tongue from below using a very refined instrument, the shape of which is:
And it should be made of silver or brass, and be thin like a knife.
Therefore, as you press with that on the tongue and the abscess is shown to you, and you have focused on it, then take a lancet and place it on the abscess, and pull it outwards as much as you can. After this, if you pull out any part of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument of this form:
After this, if you pull out any part of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument of this form: and it resembles forceps, but the ends of it are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula of this form: And be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one incision, make the other according to this same manner of incision, and after the incision the patient will be healed from cold water.
However, if bleeding occurs, apply water decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaf, or similar astringent remedies, until the bleeding is controlled, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat or near the two ears, and incise them, as I said before, in a similar manner to the incision of two incisions/cuts.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, which abscess was dark-coloured, with little feeling, and which had already closed her throat. The woman was breathing with difficulty, and she had been forbidden to eat or drink water, and she would have succumbed to death if it had been one or two days more.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two ramps (or possibly,  "protuberances" or "bulges") before it emerged through two openings.
Therefore, I incised it surgically and placed a lancet into one of them, and pulled out a large portion of it. Then I incised the area around the other opening, and then opened her mouth and pressed her tongue down, and then I placed the lancet into the abscess.
And then I excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Thus, the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began drinking water, and then ate food.  Then, I didn't stop incising that abscess many times for a long time, and another abscess appeared in the same place, which I incised until it was resolved.
Therefore, I applied a cautery to her throat, thus adding to the treatment, and then I walked away, not knowing what God would do to her from that point forward.
Chapter 37.
On the incision of a boil when it is abscessed.
When a boil develops on the uvula, and it is abscessed and long, then it is called a perpendicular boil; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, then it is called a carbuncle (or furuncle).
But when it is treated with what we have said in the division, and you do not consider your treatment complete, and sometimes the abscess is already drained and superficial, then it is necessary to incise that which is swollen and rounded; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of a dark color or black, and it is not causing pain, then it is necessary to test the incision, for in this case there is a fear of harm to the patient.
And when you see it according to the method I have described, by its whiteness and length, you should make the patient lie down and press the tongue with an instrument to determine its shape, then place a lancet on the boil, and draw it downwards, and incise it with one of two instruments mentioned in the incision of the two boils.
And it is necessary not to incise it beyond what is required for the natural boundary without further damage, for if you incise further, you will cause further problems.
And after the incision, use what we have described for the incision of two boils, and treat it until it heals.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, it is necessary to use cauterization without hesitation, and the method of cauterization in this case is with sharp water.  You should place the patient's head on your lap, then press their tongue with the instrument we mentioned, and then take the water mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and cauterize the area with this heated substance.  Place it neither thickly nor thinly, and fill the cavity of the instrument which has this form:
Let the extremity of the cavity, where the medicine is placed, be similar to the cavity of a spoon for gathering herbs, and place the instrument with the medicine on the wound.  The patient should lie on their side so that saliva or mucus from the mouth drains away from the medicine, so that nothing drips down the patient's throat and harms them.
Then apply your hand with the medicine and press it onto the uvula for half an hour until you see it blackened and subdued by the medicine's action.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the extremity of the herb, and dip the cotton into the medicine.  Insert the herb with the cotton into a tube from above until the cotton adheres to the tube.  Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it to dry and fall off after about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  Then, after the cauterization, clean the area around the uvula with cotton soaked in broth, and remove any remaining medicine.  Wash with cool water, and treat externally with a liniment and internally with remedies until healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incisions and less likely to cause fear.
Sometimes the uvula is treated with something gentler than cautery and incisions, as it is healed by fumigation in this manner: take mint, yarrow, oregano, rue, Arabian squills, chamomile, marigold, and similar herbs, and combine all or some of them in a pot.  Place them in a vessel of vinegar, and bring to a boil. The pot should be tightly sealed with proper clay, and a small hole should be made in the middle of the pot.  Over this hole, place a hollow brass or silver instrument shaped this way; it should be made of silver or brass.
And the extremity of the instrument should be inserted into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, causing the uvula to become significantly clouded.
And repeat this many times until the area is dry.  Beware that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess, for it would worsen the abscess.  You should only do this following a diagnosis of a mature abscess.
But if this instrument is not available, then take a reed and fit a piece of eggshell to its end, to prevent the patient's mouth from being irritated.  Because the eggshell will keep the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the extraction of thorns and what adheres to the throat, and other such things.
Many times a thorn or fishbone or some other thing adheres to the throat.
Then you should extract whatever of those is visible, upon which you direct your gaze, since you press the tongue with an instrument in front of a light source, so that what is in the throat may be revealed to you.
And that which is not apparent and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for the cause stuck to the throat will be forcibly expelled by vomiting; or let the patient swallow a piece of bread or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or have him take a piece of dry sea sponge, bind it tightly with thread, and then the patient will swallow it, for when it reaches the place where the thorn is, it is expelled. Or take an eel and bind it with thread, and put it inside, and it will be extracted; or take a leek and suddenly put it in and suddenly pull it out.
But if it is not expelled by those methods we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
And it should be larger than a fingertip, and at its end there is a cavity which you introduce into its throat with ease.
And have him raise his head, and be careful not to touch his throat bone, so that it does not cause him pain and with that you push the bone or thorn, or the doctor does so with his hand.
But rather that the patient himself, through his knowledge of the location of the cause, push it down, and pull his hand with the instrument up, all according to the amount that has been prepared for it until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Of the removal of bloodsucker attached to the throat.
When a bloodsucker is treated with what we have described in the division of treatment with medicines and not with remedies, then consider the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed the patient's tongue with the instrument we have described to you.
Therefore, if you see the bloodsucker, remove it with a small knife or with subtle, appropriate gestures.
And if it is not possible for you to remove it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this many times (until the bloodsucker is dead and detaches from the throat), and keep the patient away from water all day.
Then take a vessel full of cold water, and open the patient's mouth into it, and rinse the mouth with it; and do not let the patient swallow anything, and hold the water for another hour with your hand, because as soon as the bloodsucker feels the water, it will drop off.
But if it is not expelled by what we have described, then fumigate the patient with cines or asafoetida using the instrument we described for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, as often as it is necessary.
And another method of fumigation for that is that you take a bowl in which there are burning coals, and the bowl is covered with a cover in the middle of which is a hole, and the tip of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then perform fumigation above; and have the patient place their mouth on the tip of the cannula and close their mouth so the fumigation does not escape until you know the fumigation has reached the bloodsucker, for the bloodsucker will fall off quickly.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and keep the patient from drinking, and let them eat salty things and garlic, and do not let them drink water; and with this regimen it is necessary that it be expelled.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is treated when it is visible; and it is similar to tongs in shape, except that it has a curve in some places. which is placed on the bloodsucker, and its tip resembles a crane's beak, which is thin, on which it is filed, so that when you grasp something, it doesn't slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are of many kinds, in many ways, according to their appearance, each of which is discussed in this book.
And they are diverse in their puncture and incision in two ways, of which one is according to the type of abscess itself; and due to the moisture we handle.
And the second way is according to the locations on the body where they occur, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy area is different from an abscess in a joint; and for each of these, there is its own judgment concerning the operation.
And some abscesses should not be punctured until the pus has matured or filled.
Other abscesses should be lanced while they are inflamed, and have not matured to their fullness, such as abscesses near joints, for when an abscess is near a joint, its presence extends until its surrounding area can be treated, and often the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, causing contraction of that limb; or the abscess is near a vital limb, and if you delay its puncture until it is mature, it may harm the vital limb; or if it is near the anus, then lance it while it is not mature; and you should not lance it while it is inflamed, or incompletely formed; but the one near the anus, so as not to spread the infection deeper into the anus and cause a fistula, or result in an area that won't heal. However, you must know the time for puncturing the abscess, and that is when it is mature.
And you know it is mature when there is a cessation of pain and fever, and a reduction in swelling and throbbing, and the abscess's head becomes firm, and the other signs.
And because the incision should be made in the location of the pus below the abscess, and from the healing of the swelling.
And the incision should always be made along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the limbs or feet, and not in areas of tendons, nerves, or arteries; and, in general, in all locations where there is no reflection; for in those that are reflected, use incision appropriate to that part of the body.
However, when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to let it be until the digestion of it is confirmed by the swelling, as we have said; for if you make the incision before this, it prolongs the illness and produces more filth, and it strengthens the hardened layers and depth of it.
But some abscesses are incised according to the width of the flesh or body, depending on the necessity, or according to the specific part of the body.
And you should administer a small incision in small abscesses, and a large and wide incision or multiple incisions in large abscesses, according to the variety of their size.
And other abscesses require that the pus be hollowed out and incised, when it has been done in a way that it has reached a point where it is ready for this, just as happens with boils and buboes.
And some are incised with a three-angled cut; and some are incised like a myrtle leaf shape, like abscesses in the groin area.
And some of them are given a round incision, or a crescent-shaped incision, and similar to those.
But those that are not like that, such as superficial abscesses, you should only pierce them with a superficial, or flat, incision.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should pierce it and not attempt to remove all the matter at once.  Remove a portion, and then pack the abscess until the next day, and then remove a larger portion, and repeat this many times according to the stage until it is completely drained.
And especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly frail person, for often the animal spirit is weakened by the expulsion of pus, and the patient easily dies if you operate on them.
Observe this chapter with great caution, and when you make an incision to open these abscesses, you should clean the sores and then consider if the abscess's wound is small, or a flat incision, then apply a poultice of linen or old cloth.  If the abscess is large, and the incision has many fissures, then you must place medicated material into each hole until they come together.
And if a part of the skin has been cut away or indented in the abscess's perimeter, then you must fill it with old cloth or a linen strip, like when you remove breads or roots, without moisture.  Hold it tight for up to three days, then continue treating and healing it with appropriate medicines until it is healed.
But if you encounter blood flow during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar in which you've dipped a linen cloth, and place it repeatedly over the site of the blood flow.
But if the blood flow persists, then you must administer treatment and remedies, like the powders described in many parts of this book and its divisions.
But if it is wintertime, and the area of the abscess is close to many nerves, then you must soak powders in warm wine and oil, and place those over the affected areas.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you must place powders soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and keep it cool until the third day, as we have said.  Then you must drain the abscess, clean it, and administer appropriate remedies for its healing until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for understanding the universal treatment of abscesses, but according to the method of distinction, I have already described the way to treat each type of abscess individually, in separate chapters.
Chapter 41.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur on the nape of the neck.
Small abscesses occur on the nape of the neck, and these are of various types of swellings which contain membranes surrounding them; and the different types are of different sizes.
And some of them contain pus, and that which contains moisture similar to lime. And some contain moisture resembling dust, and similar to them; and some are like stones, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in their extraction, there is no fear, as their extraction does not cause any counter-action (or opposition) to the [process of] healing.
The procedure for their incision is to probe them with an instrument of a shape fitting this (or similar to this), which is called a "probe," until you know what it contains.
For if what it contains is moisture, then cut it with an incision along its length by a superficial incision in this manner:
And begin the incision from the line B to the line G.  Then, once the moisture is evacuated, you scrape away the skin that contained the moisture, and leave absolutely no residue, for if you do, it may return if any remains.
Then, soak some cotton in Egyptian ointment, if available, and otherwise in water and salt; and fill the wound with that and leave it until the next day, for with this, you corrode any remaining bits of that skin.
Then, repeatedly apply Egyptian ointment to the cotton a second and third time if necessary, until you are confident that no trace of the skin remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you incise it according to this method: with an incision shaped like a cross, and insert hooks between the two edges of the incision and scrape it from every side, and exert your effort in extracting the membrane that contains it.
But if your effort encounters resistance, then do what I have told you first.
And similarly, treat the hardened abscess with incision and healing as we have described; and incision on a hardened abscess is easier, because it contains little blood and humidity.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which occur on the heads of some men, in which there is no humidity at all.  This is why I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken; and if someone were to strike with that, it would cause pain.
However, for other accidental abscesses on the head, this is not relevant, such as abscesses occurring on the heads of children and near the roots of the ears.  But the incision for all these should be superficial.
And place the perforation in the lower part of them, so that the body is relieved of the pus to the lower parts.
And then treat them with whatever is appropriate for healing.
Chapter 42.
Concerning the incision of scrofulas that occur on the neck.
Often these abscesses appear on the neck, armpits, and groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur on the neck, and many are formed together, and every scrofula of those is within its own proper tunic, and similarly as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for some are stony, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant, which do not yield to treatment.
Therefore, in that one which you find to be well-disposed by Touch, of which the color of what is manifest is similar to the color of a swelling, and is soft in all parts, and is not attached to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, and is not deep, it is necessary that you incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from the line of G to the line of B, and drain it from all sides, and extend the flaps of the swelling with hooks, or with many hooks if you need them, as we have said for abscesses of the head, and extract that little by little.
And it is more caution that the vein or nerve is not cut.
And if the swelling is not very acute, do not apply your hand to it with an incision, or cause the patient distress, and do not cut what is unnecessary to cut; for if you cut a vein or artery and hinder your own operation, then put crushed vitriol or other powders that stop the flow of blood onto the wound, and tighten the wound, and leave it until the inflammation of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes softened and begins to fester. When the blood has been separated/removed.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then examine with your index finger if there are any other small causes of the scrofulas, and then cut those and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrophula, then you should not cut that scrophula from its roots. Before that, you should tie that with a tightly folded bandage and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
And then fill the wound with old lint which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat that.
And if you cut the entire scrophula, then you should bring together the two edges of the wound and sew it up as soon as there is no more excess fluid.
But if you see that there is excess fluid remaining due to the size of the scrophula, you should proceed to cut the root of that, and draw it out and apply stitches and the other treatments mentioned.
And those scrofulas that contain moisture, pierce them with a superficial incision at the location where you see its maturation spot, and place a drain to draw out the pus from the lower part of the body, as we have said.
And then apply a poultice, perhaps with an ointment or similar remedies, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And when you see the wound already cleansed, then you should treat it with a regenerating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Of the incision of a boil on the throat/neck.
The ancients prescribed this incision for boils, and yet no one in our land has been seen to perform it.
And this is the writing of the speech of those (ancients).
But in people with back pain, the extraction of the boil should be avoided, because this will not be beneficial, since all the veins and major organs of the patient are located there.
However, in those with hot boils in the mouth, throat, or ears, when the disease is not in the bone, one should use the incision of the boil, avoiding the loss that is done by cauterization.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the boil below three circles of the boil's circles, or four with a small incision for the width between two circles, ensuring the incision is in the thin layer, not in the cartilage. This place is suitable for incision, since it's devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant.
And if the doctor is cautious, he should then extend the throat's membranes with forceps, and then cut the membranes until he reaches the canal, but should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any reason to do so.
And then, incise the thin layer according to what we have described; and the incision of the canal is signaled by the pus that comes out of the broken part, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for a while.
Therefore, when the time for the feared perforation has passed, bring together the two edges of the wound's membrane, and stitch them together without stitching the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the treatment we have described is not sufficient unless you see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's airway, and the patient has come close to death, and the patient's breathing is cut off, and some people would cut into the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe at the wound site, allowing for some breathing, and thus saved from death.
And therefore I command to leave the wound open until the harmful nature of the illness is consumed; and that harm lasts for three days; and then, I command to close the wound and heal it until it is healthy.
And what I myself have seen is that a servant took a knife and put it in their own throat and cut a portion of the windpipe, and I was called to treat them, and I found the person's breathing like the breathing of the dying, and I discovered the wound and found the blood that had come from the wound was little.
Therefore, I was told that she had not cut any vein or artery, and air was coming out of the wound, and I treated it until it was healed.
And it did not happen to the servant unless it was in the throat, and after some days she returned to a better condition.
And now I say that there is no fear in the treatment of epilepsy.
Chapter XLIV.
Of the incision on an abscess that occurs outside the throat, and is called a hernia of the throat.
This abscess, called a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and is very common in women.
And it is in two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, there is no way to cure it.
And the accidental case is in two ways, of which one is similar to fatty lumps, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by an artery swelling, and in that one there is fear (or danger). And it is not appropriate to use iron (a cautery) on it if it is large, but only on one that is small. And you should test it and investigate it with your finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty tumor and it's not connected to any of the veins, then cut it as you would cut tumors, and remove what contains it from the skin and pouch; but if not, then investigate the entire nature of it, and then treat the area with whatever treatment is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of types of tumors.
There are many types of tumors, and I have already discussed all their types in the division.
And it is necessary for me to recount the difference between a tumor and a hernia, in case there is doubt.
Thus I say that with a hernia, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the excess is calmed; and when putrefaction is complete, then the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a tumor, there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it resembles a lion's tooth, which is in the own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a seed, and is made thus, whether larger or smaller, and there are two types, for it is either fatty and contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a tumor, you must probe it and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument called an *intromes*, as its form will be found in the chapter close to this one.
And this is the way to investigate abscesses and all tumors, and you should take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place you find in the abscess, and you will rotate your fingers with that little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the membrane.
And then place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the *intromes* and consider what has come out on the residue of it.
And if the flowing moisture, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you incise it with a superficial section, as I have said in the other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture from the residue of the *intromes*, then know that it is fatty.
And dry it over it with a cross-shaped incision following this shape: As I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and carefully scrape the skin from all sides, and if possible, preserve the skin or sac over it and extract the pus with a probe.
However, if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to extract the pus completely, and this often happens, and then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains.
For if any part, little or much, remains, the probe will return to the same place.
And if you see that any small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and compress the wound, and place a hot poultice over it, and treat it with further care until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, then you sew the two edges together and treat it with something that promotes healing.
But if there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein there, then you cauterize and fill the area with powdered crushed glass (vitriol), and leave it there for two or three days until the wound is clean and the blood's ebullition subsides; then return to dissecting what remains of the wound.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary for incision and perforation.
Of those [instruments], there are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, or bronze, with properly sharpened ends, so that they easily penetrate abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called probes, and one of them is called a lancet.
And there are three types, for some are large, medium, and small.
The form of the large instrument, its shape:
The form of the medium instrument, its shape:
The form of the small instrument, its shape:
It is fitting that they be used for those abscesses, ulcers, fistulas, and buboes, since within them are the bones and other things.
And they are made round, thick, pointed, like large needles with which saddles are stitched, and they are made of citrus wood, or of horn, or of iron, or of silver.  And the best are when made of citrus wood.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are believed to be used to open fistulas in whose cavities there are reflections, which are reflected with their lightness through those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, and others are middling, and others short, according to the amount of the width of the fistula and the constriction of it.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the middling lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many types, for some of them are simply single curves, and are of three types: large, small, and middling.
And of them are some hooks without a handle, and they are of three types.
And of those are hooks with two curves, and they are of three types.
And of them are some with three curves, and they are of three types.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and lanced, and they are of three kinds, for of those there are large, medium, and small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium-sized scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The edges with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other edges are blunt, and they are not placed in such a manner as to facilitate the lancing of the nodes while avoiding cutting a vein or nerve, so that the patient is cured and finds a little tranquility due to the cauterization that occurs around the lancing of the abscess.
And these are the forms of lancets, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of iron and are similar in shape to a ray, with which alcohol is made.
And it has a pointed tip hidden by a sheath, and in that sheath are parts inside and out, which you can adjust, as you see fit.
The forms of lancets, which are hidden among the fingers near the opening of abscesses and are not perceived by the patients, come in three varieties: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those:
The shapes of leeches, with which the flow of blood is drawn, are of three kinds; large, medium, and small; the shapes of them are:
They should be made of citrus wood, round with some length, and thin.
And these types of leeches—large, medium, and small—are needed, so that the flow of blood is drawn quickly when necessary, and this is not medicine at first.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body. Use them only on fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, the muscles of the arms, breasts, abdomen, and knees, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments are made, resembling the skins of bladders in this way, through which blood is drawn when performed through phlebotomy, or incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round, in this shape:
Chapter 47.
Of the care of the breasts of men that are like those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become swollen during sleep, as they begin to grow hair, and then the breasts swell, resembling the breasts of women, and become inflamed, painful.
And whoever sees this should incise those [breasts] with a lunar incision, following this shape, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the swelling, and then fill the wound with a flesh-inducing medicine, and then stitch the two edges of the wound together, and care for it until it is healed.
But if the breast descends downwards and is softened by its size, as happens in women, then it should be cut into two layers, with two crescent-shaped incisions, each one contained within the other near the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller one, like the line B and G.  Then scrape away the flesh between the two edges of the wound, and remove the excess fat, and use the previously described stitching and powders necessary for healing until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision necessary due to the patient's distress and blood flow, then the wound should be filled with cotton soaked in a corrosive unguent, and allow it to corrode away the remaining fat, and then care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the opening of abscesses that come from beneath the skin.
These abscesses that come from beneath the skin are a type of hard scrofulous swelling, containing a sac-like skin.
And of these, some contain moisture; and those containing moisture should be incised with a lunar incision, following this figure: from line G to line B.  And once all the pus within the abscess has been evacuated, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.
And then the cotton should be removed and treated with a suitable ointment until healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes or scrofulous swellings, then you should incise it in the same way as we described in the section on scrofulous swellings.
If the ulcer is spreading in such a way that it might break open, then apply a cautery to it as previously described.
Chapter 49.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur from arrow wounds or vein wounds.
When an arrow wound is made, and the clot that forms over it, often an abscess occurs.  And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are from an artery or vein: for when an abscess is from an arrow wound, it is long and concentrated in the front of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a wheezing or whistling sound in it.
And the one that is from a vein is round and clearly visible on the body.
And an incision on this abscess is a mistake, especially in those under the armpits, in the elbows, in the neck, and in many parts of the body; and if it is large, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and the one in the extremities or the head should be avoided.
But for those that are caused by inflammation of the wound of the arrow wound, make an incision along the clot; then use hooks to widen the incision around the arrowhead and clear away the tissues until it is exposed.
Then place a needle on it and drive it through to the other side, and tightly bind the arrowhead with a double thread in two places—which I show you in the extraction of two arrows that are in the temples.
And then lance the area between the two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood comes out and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment to the area where pus has formed until the ligaments fall off; and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess caused by a cut vein, then you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess as possible with the clot, and then insert the needle below the area you've held under your hand and drive it through; and put a double thread there until you extract it from the other side, and then bind the abscess with a strong bandage, as I have instructed you about the grape-vine bandage, with two parts, two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that we will pull out the thread, then insert the thread with the needle below the whole abscess beneath the incision of the first needle, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until whatever is within it comes out, then you cut away the excess clot and leave what is bound to it.
Then place on it a poultice that you have soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment made with herbs and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Thus, abscesses occur in the arteries and veins, and similarly abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured by blows or excessive exertion, and by similar causes.
And it [the abscess] is most common in the areas of the tendons or the heel, or in any place where the joints are damaged.
And it is a severe abscess, and it is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it is in the majority of cases without any visible sign until it is tight with violence; the patient feels a similar stupor [or numbness].
And it is not an abscess that spreads through the body, and therefore it stays under the skin, and it is hurt in all directions, but does not extend forward or backward.
Therefore, those [abscesses] that are in the joints should not be incised with iron, for a strong contraction will likely ensue.
But that which is on the head or forehead [an abscess] should be opened with a lancet. But if the abscess is small, then take it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
And if it is large, then you should suspend it with forceps, scrape it, and then remove it; and close the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of the incision of an abscess that occurs in the groin and that affects the belly.
Many times, in the bellies of some men and in other parts of their bodies, there are growths that are called funguses by their resemblance to fungi.  Their roots are subtle, but their heads are large; and their edges are turned inwards.  They are sometimes small, and sometimes quite enlarged.
And I have seen one, and in its belly were two growths which were very fungus-like, and there was no difference between them, being white with fine roots.
And their edges were inverted and cracked, and moisture dripped from them constantly.
Therefore, I incised them, and found in one a weight of eighteen ounces, and in the other six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is that you should consider if the patient is damp, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with fine roots; then you should cut it with a broad blade, and have cauteries ready in the fire, because often a lot of blood is released when cutting them; and if you see blood, cauterize that area.
And if the patient is fearful and anxious, beware of incisions with iron; but then take fresh lead solder, and press it against the growth, in the manner we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead strip; therefore, do not cease pressing the lead strongly against the growth until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the growth has thick roots, then its incision causes some fear and anxiety, especially if it is in the belly.
But it is possible that you cut it in half, and then cauterize the area so that it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to presume to cut a growth that is dark-colored, insensitive, and easily overlooked, for that is often cancerous.
And I will bring a remedy for cancer to this.
Chapter 52.
On the treatment of an eminence (or swelling) of the navel.
An eminence at the navel is caused by various things; either by fissures in the surrounding tissue over the abdomen, and this is a kind of rupture, a part of the intestines or tissue being involved, as in other ruptures; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery, as already mentioned; or by trapped wind (gas) in the area.
However, if it's due to a fissure in the surrounding tissue and consequent extrusion of tissue, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and it is painless, and it appears in various locations. And if it's due to the intestine protruding, then the location of the swelling, differs significantly from what we have already described; and when you press on it with your fingers, it's hidden, then returns; and it's very close to the abdominal entrance, and it's greatly magnified right by the entrance of the abdomen (or groin), and with strong exertion.
But if it's due to moisture, then it is painless, and it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it swollen.
And if it's due to blood, then the abscess appears with these symptoms, showing a darkening.
But if it's due to dead flesh, then the abscess is severe, large, and hard, and is fixed in a particular quantity (or area).
But if it's due to wind (gas), then the touch of it is painless.
And the operation on it is that you should consider whether the swelling near the navel is due to blood from an arrow wound, or a vein, or wind; then you must be cautious in treating it, because there is fear and anxiety as I have shown you in the chapter where I discussed abscesses from arrow wounds and vein injuries.
And if the swelling of the navel is due to the bowel or the mesentery, then you must tell the patient to hold their breath, and be standing and stretched out; then probe with a tenta around the entire navel, and then instruct the patient to keep still while you place your hands on their side, and then encircle the area around the navel, covering the spot you marked with the probe; and then extend the half of the abscess on the upper side with a large incision; and then tie it up around with a strong thread or silk, and with the appropriate method of tying.
And then pierce the middle of the extended abscess over the ligament, and insert your finger into that opening and look for the bowel; and if you find it and it's held by the ligament, then gently extract it and push the bowel back into the belly cavity.
And if you have found the mesentery, then take it with a knife and cut away the excess parts of it.
But if it's an arrow wound or vein, then encircle that area, and then return to your procedure; and take two needles and put strong threads in them, and insert the two needles into the circle you've made around the abscess in a cross-like manner, making them penetrate; and then compress the abscess in four sections over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and let the area be until the stretched flesh is softened and falls off on its own; or cut it when it is softened and about to fall off, and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
If the swelling around the navel is caused by flesh growth or moisture, then you must drain the abscess as we have said, and remove the blood or moisture you find there, and then treat it with what is appropriate to consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
Of the treatment of cancer.
We have already stated, in the division, the types of cancer and the ways to treat them with medicine, and that surgery is harmful in these cases, as it might create ulcers; and we have discussed cancer originating in the breast and the precautions for its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated, just as with cancer that is in the breasts or the thigh, and similar locations on the limbs, it is possible to remove all of it, especially when it is small and just beginning.
But when it is advanced and severe, one should not try to treat it directly, for I myself have not been able to cure any such case, nor have I seen another who has succeeded in doing so.
And the operation in these cases, as we have said, is that you should first let the patient rest and sometimes purge them of black bile, and then bleed them if a clear fullness is found.
And then prepare the patient with the preparation in which the operation will be performed, and then insert hooks appropriate to the location; and then, using a good sharp chisel, excavate from all sides until no trace of the cancer roots remains. And let the blood flow, and do not cut it off lightly, and express the areas, and cleanse the thick blood completely with your hand or with any instrument available to you.
However, if you encounter difficulty with thick blood from a vein or artery incision, then cauterize that until the blood flow ceases, and then treat it with the other cure until it is healed.
Chapter 54.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy from water, and the signs of each type, and the treatment of it with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of "altheia" (a kind of dropsy), and it is not appropriate to treat with iron the type of "tympanists" or the type of "hypasarcha," for that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanist dropsy with medicines and your treatment does not produce results, then consider whether the patient is already weakened, or has another illness, or another type of dropsy, as if it is in his chest or abdomen and similar to those, then be careful not to treat him with iron, for fear of that.
However, if you see the patient's condition as exuberant, and there is no other illness but dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old person, then the method of operating on him is that you lift the patient between your hands, and the attendant should press his belly with his hand, pressing the water towards the part below the navel, and then take spiny sponges in this way:
They should be of two pointed parts, long, with a sharp end like a sponge; however, let there be some small shortness in them, so that in the operation with them you do not enter the intestine and injure it.
And then consider if the dropsy originates from the intestines, because then you must, with the incision, move away from the navel by the amount of three fingers towards the lower parts, to the right of it, above the navel.
But if the dropsy is caused by liver disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the left.
And your incision should not be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, lest the superfluities run to that place and obstruct it.
And then pierce with the instrument all the membrane, and then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the membrane and the surface, and you scrape that; and if it is the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then pierce the surface until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the space for the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the shape: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or brass or lead, on the lower part of which is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its end is incised in the manner of a pen, like this:
And on its highest end is a guard, for when the instrument reaches the water, then this immediately falls onto the instrument, thus evacuating the water in a moderate amount; for if you evacuate more than is necessary at the time, the patient will die quickly by resolution of their animal spirit, or suffer a fatal collapse.
But evacuate it according to the amount indicated by its power, and according to the indications you find in the patient's condition, the strength of their pulse, and their constitution.
And then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water, the reason being that it is immediately retained by the cord which holds the hole that is above the "ciphas" (probably referring to a specific anatomical part); and I am telling you to perforate it in this manner.
And then repeat the procedure on another day, if the patient tolerates it, and withdraw a small amount of water; and do this for several days with caution, and be mindful of errors until only a little water remains.
However, if you fear for the patient, and leave a large amount of water, then treat that with hot sand burial, and induce sweating by bathing, and exposure to the sun for a long time; and treat it with drying medicines until it is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, spleen, and liver after the extraction of the water, as I have described in what has gone before.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children born with unperforated urinary passages.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urethra is not perforated (or is a narrow slit or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born with very fine instruments using this method:
And then place a thin lead peg in the opening, and tie it, and leave it in place for three days or four.
And when it wants to urinate, let it urinate; and then remove it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine flowing over the area will not allow this closure to heal.
But that from which the opening is narrow should be treated with a lead peg, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
But those in which the opening is not in its place, as mentioned, the cause of which is that, one who is born with the opening at the end of the penis' head, so that they cannot urinate properly, until one elevates the penis with one's hand to the upper areas; and it is not due to their generative organs, since the semen cannot reach the mother in a straight manner, and it is a very slow illness.
And the method of the operation in this case is that the patient be placed on their back, and then extend the head of their penis with your left hand with forceful extraction, and cut the foreskin of the penis' head with a sharp scalpel, just as one cuts a feather, or whatever part you remove, so that the middle of the penis becomes like the penis' head and that the opening falls into the proper middle place as needed.
And be careful, in your operation dealing with blood flow, for many times this happens; and stop there with whatever you used to cut the blood, and heal the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Of the whitiness that occurs on the foreskin, on the head of the penis, and of corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
Many times this white discoloration occurs on the penis, and it is a protrusion of loose flesh.
And of that one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine instrument and cut away the affected area until it is completely removed; then place a piece of cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment on it; and then continue treating it with diaphnicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the white discoloration is malignant, of a dark color, then you must apply cautery near the incision and the root of it.
But if the white discoloration is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis, and one part of the discoloration is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you must remove the discoloration that is inside first until it is healed; and then treat the part outside, for when you treat both at the same time, including the foreskin, it's not guaranteed that it won't be torn.
And if you see blackness and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then you must remove all that which is already blackened and about to rot, or that which is already rotten; and then you should apply a mixture to that area of honey, crushed pomegranate bark flour, and crushed and sifted herbs.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply a lunar cautery according to this method:
for a helpful cautery is useful in two situations at once, that is, in cases of blood flow and when the wound is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and entirely destroyed at once, then you must insert a lead cannula into the foreskin's opening so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only occurs in those whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) you must scrape with a blunt instrument until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then you must scrape away some part of the head of the penis and the foreskin, and this is because the foreskin, when thin and delicate, is easily pierced due to its thinness.
And then, separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth, which has been moistened with cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then treat it with astringent wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Concerning the purification of children and the treatment of complications arising from circumcision.
Circumcision is not a simple break in the skin like other wounds; however, since it is an act of our own doing and volition, and its purpose is primarily in children, it is necessary to assign to it the best possible procedure and the easiest path to recovery.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws.  However, since we have acquired knowledge through experience, I have observed that most artisans and barbers use circumcision and cleansing with a small knife and with tweezers; and they use ligatures with thread and incisions with the fingernail.
And I have already tested all these methods, and I find no better purification than with scissors, and ligating with thread, compared to cleaning with the fingernail, because often the foreskin is peeled away incompletely, for the foreskin has two layers, and the deeper layer remains, and a further incision is necessary, causing unnecessary pain. And with purification done by a tool used by cobblers, which is digital, the incision of the male member's end is not secure, because it easily enters the opening.
But in the procedure using a fingernail, it is very easy to slip and damage your work. And the foreskin of a child is naturally short, and many times is born in such a way that it requires no purification, and I have seen that.
But the purification done with scissors and ligatures with thread, is the best, my experience shows, because the scissors are for a proportional incision, in that the sharpness on top is the same as the sharpness underneath; and thus, when you press with your hand, both sharp edges are in proportion, and so it cuts in one stroke; and a compression of the thread is made, encasing the foreskin of the penis completely, with which no mistakes are made.
And the first way of the operation is to have the child mostly still, if it is one that understands a little, to simply tie the thread around its penis and leave it until the next day.
And then make him/her happy in every way that is possible, considering the child's understanding. And then have the child remain still between your hands, and let no one else move; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them, nor any other instruments.
Then place your hand on its penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it back until the head of the penis is exposed, and then clean it of any dirt that may be clinging to it.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning, this is the shape:
One end should be blunt and the other sharp, so that the blade of the scissor does not come out, and the length of both blades should be approximately the same as the length of two handles combined.
But the mistake in cleaning is that you forcibly pull the foreskin completely, or part of it, away from the incision.
Therefore, you should spread it gently with your fingernail before forming the abscess and cut it along equal lengths.
And if you can't hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with tweezers and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and that which is swollen below the penis remains in the abscess, then you leave it until the hot abscess has subsided, and you gently remove the excess, and cut it according to what you have prepared.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for that will not help him.
And therefore treat it with that which strengthens the wound from the powders which we have described in the treatise on powders.
And if it is cut from the scrotum excessively, and you attend to the parts above, that will not help him.
And further treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Of the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by an obstruction formed by stone or congealed blood, or by pus or clots, and similar to those we have discussed in the section on treatment methods.
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said, and the cause is severe upon the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver, and be a subtly curved tube, like a small bird's quill, with a long, thin, pointed shaft, similar to a hand-and-a-half in length, with a narrow tube at its tip.
And the manner of drawing the urine with this is that you take a doubled cloth and tie wool or cotton to one end for good binding; and insert the ends of the cloth into the area below the syringe, and cut away any excess cloth with scissors, but insert it forcefully into the tube.  Then lubricate the syringe with oil and egg white.
And have the patient lie on their back, and lubricate their bladder and penis with moist oils, and olive oil and water.
And then gently insert the syringe until it reaches the root of the penis; and then pull the penis upward towards the navel; and then push the syringe further into that; and then push it until it reaches the bladder.  And when the patient has reached the empty area/cause, and this is not done following this order, but rather the passage, which has a twist/turning.
And then pull the cloth with the wool little by little, for the urine will soak the wool.
Then remove it and collect the urine, and continue using the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter .lix.
Of the quality of bladder irrigation with a clamp and similar instruments that are appropriate for this.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or congealed blood is present, or the urethra is constricted, and you want to instill liquids and medicines into it, then use an instrument called a clamp, and this is its form:
but rather, at its tip, it is closed. And in that are three openings: two on one side, thus, twice.
At the beginning is a concave space, in which that which is pushed is located, and be according to the quantity that oppresses it, without addition, until when any cause pulls it with the humidities, it is drawn, and when it is expelled, with this, it is pulled, and when it is expelled far, according to how a clamp is used to inject naphtha into sea battles.
Therefore, when you want to inject liquids into the bladder, insert the tip of the clamp into the liquid, and pull with it that which is pushed toward the upper parts, for the liquid is drawn into the cavity of the clamp.
And then insert the tip of the clamp into the penis, as we have recounted in the surgical procedure; and then push the liquid with what you push, for that liquid reaches the bladder immediately, and the patient is cured from that.
Shape of the subtle instrument with which the bladder is drained, and this is the shape:
And it should be made of silver or lead, of which the upper head resembles a small feather, and below it a small tube within the ligament.
And then take a bladder, and put into it the liquid you want to drain from the bladder, and then tie that between two with a strong bandage with double thread, and heat that liquid over the fire.
And then insert the tip of the instrument into the penis.
And then press your hand down on the bladder containing the liquid with firm pressure until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and pierce it all the way through; and then insert strong thread into those holes, winding it around; and then attach the circle as it is attached to a poultice, and place in it what you want of the liquids, oils, and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument, and use it the same way as you did with the bladder, and express with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of stones.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and their symptoms.
And we have discussed the stones in which manual operation and incision are used.
And the stone formed in the bladder is properly that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear explanation and brevity.
Therefore, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly affect children; and among their symptoms is that the urine expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, and sand appears in it; and the patient frequently rubs their genitals, often groans, and then is straightened up; and with this, they expel a large amount of stool in some cases.
And the cure is easier in children before they reach fourteen years of age; and it is a difficult cure in the elderly. But in young people, it is more moderate because it is among them. (or: ...it is more manageable because it is among them.)
And in the case of the larger stone, the cure is easier; and if it is small, the treatment is the opposite.
Therefore, in approaching the cure for this, it is necessary at the beginning to cleanse the patient with a clyster that removes all the impurities in their intestines; for this impurity sometimes prevents the expulsion of the stone despite an investigation of the condition.
And then the patient should be placed with their feet raised and gently massaged from below so that the stone descends towards the bladder, or that it shifts position in some cases.
And then, perform the clyster with your prepared hands, and the patient's hands should be placed under their thighs, so that the entire bladder is tilted towards the lower parts.
And then, remove that (stone) and all of that outward.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you should immediately apply a section upon it.
And if it doesn't entirely descend with your touch, then you should lubricate your left index finger (if the patient is a child) or middle finger (if the patient is an adult) with oil, and insert it into their anus. And remove the stone until it is beneath your finger. And move it little by little until it reaches the bladder's opening.
Then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards to the location from which you extracted it.
And instruct the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and instruct another assistant to, using their right hand, pull the genitals upwards, and with their left hand, hold the perineum (the area between the genitals), somewhat away from the location of the incision.
And then insert the instrument appropriately in the incision, which is this instrument's shape: And you cut through the area between the anus and genitals, not in the middle but closer to the left thigh; let the incision be along that stone and your finger be in the anus, and make a transverse incision so that the incision is wider on the outside and narrower on the inside, according to the amount of stone's protrusion (or the area exposed) possible.  Do not make it larger, because if you press your finger too hard on the anus, the stone will be driven further into the body, and be impossible to reach.
And know that the stone has some angles and edges, which makes its removal difficult because of that.
And that one, resembling a gland, is round, and is easily removed.
Therefore, if it is one with angles and edges, it fits into the fissure.
And if it is not easily removed, then you must gently press upon it, or firmly press upon it with a suitable tool, whose tip is like a file, with which you press on the stone, and do not move it; or insert underneath it a subtle, curved instrument.
But if you cannot remove it, then you enlarge the hole a little, and if you see blood flowing, staunch it firmly with crushed vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then at first you press your hand against the mouth of the bladder, and then you cut into it; then push a little further into it; and do likewise if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is folly to cut it with a large incision, for you cause the patient one of two things: either death or a continuous flow of urine, because the area is not completely healed.
But administer something to expel it until it is removed, or use forceps to fracture it until you extract it in pieces.
So, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood, and staunch it. And place over it a cloth soaked in olive oil and wine, or in oil mixed with cool water, so that a hot abscess may be reduced.
And then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you have removed it, anoint the area with water and oil, then treat it with unguent diafinicon and unguent diabazilicon until it is healed.
But if a hot, burning, corrosive abscess occurs in the wound, resembling frozen blood in the bladder, preventing urination (and this is recognized by blood appearing in the urine), then insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will cause the bladder to corrupt and putrefy.
And then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and with other suitable remedies for its treatment until it is healed.
And throughout the course of treatment, you must tie the thighs together and adjust the medications placed on the affected area.
And if the stone is small and is in the urethra, embedded in it, and urination is also blocked, then treat it with what I previously recommended, before resorting to incision, because many times this treatment has been accused of causing incision.  I myself have tested this, and it is necessary that you use a sharp, iron drill, of which this is the form:
of triangular tip, sharp, fitted into a shaft.
And then take a bandage, and tie the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, puncturing easily until the drill reaches that stone. And rotate the drill with your hand around that small stone little by little, and you enlarge the hole until you cause the other side to penetrate; for then the urine will be released.
And then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outer side of the penis, for that is broken, and has been pushed out with the urine, and the patient is cured.
But if this cure is not suitable for any reason that prevents it, then tie a bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. And then cut on the stone in that penis between the two bandages. And then remove that. And then loosen the bandage and clean the congealed blood, which has formed on the wound.
And a bandage below the stone is not necessary, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other bandage above it is only necessary because when the bandage is loosened around the stone's exit, the stone returns to its place and the wound heals.
And therefore, when you bandage above, it is necessary for you to lift the stone upward, or it will return to your incision and the wound will heal as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Of the extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
But if a stone is found in any of them, then the cure is difficult and prohibited by many methods.
One of them is because the woman is very young and a virgin.
And the second is because you do not find a woman well-versed enough to disclose herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or she is one of the women having husbands.
The third is that you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the operation with the hands.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on a stone in women is far from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity compels you to do this, then you should take a knowledgeable female physician, and few are found.
But if you are deprived of such a woman, then seek a skilled and subtle male physician, or present a matron well-versed in the matters of women, or a woman who is knowledgeable in this art.
Therefore, present her, and command her to do everything you instruct her, from the examination for the stone at the beginning; which is to observe if the woman is a virgin, then she must put her finger into her anus and feel for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, she should hold it with her finger, and then command her to make an incision above it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone,  and place her left hand over the bladder, and firmly compress it.
Therefore, if she finds it, then she must gradually pull it out of the bladder opening towards the lower parts with the strength of her hand until she brings it to the root of the thigh.
And then make an incision above that, about halfway down the vagina, near the root of the thigh, wherever it's lodged, and place the stone in that area, and her finger should not be removed from the stone holding it.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert a probe into that incision, and if she feels the stone, then adjust the incision according to the size she knows the stone will be expelled from.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and sharp and rough, and long and round, and having grooves/ridges.
Therefore, you know how many types there are of them, so that you signify what you want about them.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the area and leave it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your procedure until the stone is expelled.
And prepare with your tools, the ones that are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you may be assisted by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and know that the expulsion of blood is from the wound, then you apply powder to the area and press it with bandages and tighten it firmly, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will easily die. And then treat the wound.
Therefore, when the flow of blood has subsided after a few days, and the area heals, then you return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
An acute hernia is nothing more than a collection of moisture in the white sac, which is beneath the folds of the genitals containing the testicles, and it is called the sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper fold which nature has prepared in the area of the testicle, until there is another testicle present; and it is the fold of the groin, between the white sac which we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a pouch.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is discharged into them, and sometimes it occurs due to a blow sustained to the genitals.
And this moisture has many colours, for its colour is either inclining towards yellow or bloody, or red, or black and feculent, or watery and white, and this is what is most important.
And the signs by which it is known where this collection of water is are these: for if it is in the white sac that we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, sloping slightly to a length like the shape of an egg, and the testicle is displaced, because the moisture contains it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper fold, then the abscess is round with a portion of the testicle, and for this reason one thinks it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the folds of the genitals and the white sac, then it pushes downwards from the centre.
And if you want knowledge of the moisture's colour, then you probe the colour of the moisture in the abscess with a pointed instrument of which the shape is predetermined; and according to what comes out on the instrument's trace, judge what is within it.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, then it is necessary to instruct the patient to be bled if possible, and to empty his body.
And then let him lie on his back on some raised surface, and place soft cloths beneath him.
And then sit on the patient's left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on the right, extending their staff to one of two places, at the fold of the genitals and at the lower part of the belly.
And then take a sharp instrument and split the fold of the genitals from the middle lengthwise toward the pubic area.
And let the incision be made along a straight line, equidistant from the line that would divide the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white spot encompassing [the area].
And scrape that area, and observe, and be careful not to cut it; and your scraper, with which you scrape, should be held lightly and very subtly and carefully scrape the area to the best of your ability.
And then pierce the water-filled sac with a wide opening, and remove all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with forceps, and spread the sac apart; and do not touch the fold of the genitals encompassing [it], and cut the sac in whatever way is possible for you. And cut it entirely or in pieces, and especially its subtle layers, for if you do not carefully and thoroughly cut it, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
However, if the sac protrudes from its sheath during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the sac, return it within, and then stitch the two lips of the sheath of the genitals together, and then treat it like any other wound until it heals.
And if you find the sac corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are on the suspensory ligament, and remove the sac, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid is collected in two separate pockets, for example, then know that there are two hernias; therefore, cut that part as you have done in the other incision; and if it appears to you that it is a single operation, then you should perform it as one.
And then you cleanse the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose-scented oil; and place another piece of wool soaked in wine and oil outside this, and spread it over the genitals and the navel; and place on top folded cloths and powders, and tie them on top with a bandage shaped like this:
And then two cloths are taken and filled with scented wool in this manner; and their ends are bound with cotton or damp wool, and they are secured with a bandage to the groin area of the breeches; one end reaches from the bottom to the middle, and the other end reaches to the area of the groin, and two more ends are placed on the thighs, and two others on the shins.  All the bandage should be fastened to the groin area of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery in place of cutting with iron;  it is done by taking a thin, knife-like cautery, and cutting the skin of the groin area with it.  It is heated as we have described until the white pouch containing the fluid is exposed.  Then you should take a cautery of this shape: And it resembles a Greek letter.
And then pierce through that pouch, and heat it until all the moisture is expelled.
Then spread the pouch with hooks, and scrape with hooks and a heated, thin cautery; and cut it as best as possible until you remove everything; and be careful that the egg (the testicles) are not touched by the fire.
And know that this operation is safer and less prone to bleeding, and better than an operation using a cut.
However, if during the incision or cauterization, or bleeding, there is a contrary inflammation (abscess), then you must treat any adverse effect with a remedy appropriate to the situation, as described.
But if the patient is weak and does not expect a second operation because of its severity, then perform the perforation as I recommend; and this is when you are certain, through what we have said about the meanings, that the hernia is acute.
Then you must make the patient sit on a raised surface, then pierce the abscess in the lowest part with a wide spatula, and position the puncture along the length of the body.
And keep the opening wide until all the fluid drains out.
And then apply a cloth to the area, and bandage it, and leave it, so that the remaining fluid drains out. And then treat that until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the draining of fluid at that time, you pierce it again.  This is done only because the white membrane in the wound's opening creates resistance and prevents the fluid from exiting.  In that case, you must insert a lancet or an instrument used to extract fluid from dropsy patients (a type previously described) or apply gentle pressure to the wound.
And know that the fluid returns, and is accumulated again approximately every six months or thereabouts; and when it is accumulated, it should then be pierced using the same method, so the patient will thus pass their days.
Chapter 63.
Of the incision on a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that incising this fleshy hernia carries a risk of harm in many cases; therefore, I have observed that leaving it alone and allowing it to heal naturally is often the better course of action.
And I remember the operation on this and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the body, where the veins are gathered together, and this is caused by many things: either by a sharp, excessive humours that are dispersed to the veins, or by impact.
And the color of the abscess follows the color of the body, and if there is no pain there, it is a serious abscess.
And a hard, stony abscess is a serious one, its color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by inflammation of the arteries, and by swelling of those, just as it has already been perceived, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is due to inflammation of the arteries is known by the spreading of the abscess when you press it with your fingers; and it is not appropriate to touch it.
However, that which is caused by inflammation of the vein is not spread by any cause upon pressing with the fingers.
And it is possible that on this type [of abscess] an incision can be made, and on the surrounding flesh; and that you cut open the tissue around the genitals, then pull the testicle outward, and extract it from the white sac, and free the suspensory ligaments, tie them, and cut the suspensory ligament further, as you free it completely from all parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already embedded in that flesh, then you must extract the testicle and cut it.
And if there is adhesion to any part of the sac, or between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the location of the adhesion behind it, then you must cut away everything surrounding it, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Thus, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in olive oil and wine; and then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of inguinal hernia.
The inguinal hernia is characterized by an abscess surrounded by a swelling resembling a sprout, accompanied by softening of the testicles.  Difficult movement, exercise, and walking are made difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this disease, it is important to be cautious about the factors that preceded it.
However, it is necessary to describe the operation as soon as the first symptoms appear.
And I say that you should make the patient sit on a raised stool; then gently pull the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; and then grasp the scrotum with your fingers, using the instruments that are suitable for the penis; and let another assistant do the same, extending them forcefully.
Then, using a sharp, thin scalpel, make a transverse incision along the side of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then, scrape away everything as we have described in the extraction of arrows that are embedded in the temples.
And then, insert a needle with a double thread into those (wounds), and tie it to the first place where you cut, and tie it again to the back of the wound. And then, cut them in the middle, longitudinally, and remove that which is accumulated of the fetid and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the treatment for other wounds where you want pus to be generated, so that the vessels which nourished one of the two genitals, for it is not bad for that.
But if you injure all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be closed/sealed with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they become hardened, or that they are closed/sealed so that they are not useful with them.
Chapter 65.
Of the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture, which develops in the extended flank over the abdomen, on the part of the groin's folds in the abdomen, so that some intestines (or bowels) are outside the body through this rupture.
And this rupture is either of the flank or of the groin, and these two types happen due to many causes: either a blow, or a fall, or a cry, or the lifting of a heavy object, or similar things.
And the sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the flank, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly, and it is a swelling that gradually extends towards the groin, because the flank compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the flank, is that at the beginning, it causes sudden, intense pain; and it is a diverse swelling appearing beneath the nearby groin, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and the body part of the intestine being outside the flank.
And sometimes the intestine and its covering are extruded, and this is called an intestinal hernia or a bowel rupture.
Sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes a tear in the intestine occurs and is retained there.  This causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes creates severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the varieties of this illness with iron is fear, because the use of iron should be avoided in that case.
And the method of the operation for this is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine back into its cavity with their hand if it returns willingly, and then it should be placed back on its place, between your hands, and raise the patient's legs.
Then, gently lift the scrotum, which is above the testicles, and cut the scrotum completely lengthwise.  Then, using forceps, carefully separate the edges of the incision as needed to open the wound.
And if the incision, according to the amount that is possible for you, allows the testicle to be removed.
And then carefully scrape away the tissues under the scrotum until the hard, white tissue of each part is exposed.
Then, insert your finger into the area where the testicle is located, between the white tissue under the scrotum and the other tissue, and carefully separate any adhesions on the back of the testicle.
Then, hold the scrotum outward with one hand, and with the other hand, pull the white tissue upwards, and elevate the testicle along with the tissue toward the incision.  Instruct the assistant to hold the testicle up, while you dissolve the adhesions behind it with a suitable solution.
And check with your fingers to see if there is any cause for the intestine to be wrapped in the hard white tissue. But if you find any such cause, then you push it back into the abdominal cavity.
And then make an incision in the area below the scrotum, through which blood and pus will flow, as we have described in what we have said.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound; and apply the bandage we have described (and sometimes the white tissue is cauterized, which we mentioned near the incision to stop the flow of blood, because often that happens); and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if the healing is delayed, then apply warm water, and keep it on until it falls off, as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of wind-blown hernia.
In this hernia, I have seen nothing that has been improved by burning it with iron.
And the first ones would say that it is done as we have described in the hernia that is with wine;  which is that you tie the vessels close to the incision, with ease, and then cauterize the middle area around the abscess with something that opens it, until the vessels fall away.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture that occurs in the ankles.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the ankles as we have said, and you should evacuate the area.
And do not leave any cause of intestines in the groin; and if they do, it is slight; and it returns at all times.
However, if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure in the hip is likely until the intestine descends into the hip; and this happens due to the extension of the hip, which is in the ankle as we have said, which causes the hip to be stretched, and then softened, and the area becomes inflamed and evacuated.
And the cure for it is with cautery, as was previously described.
And sometimes it is cured with an iron according to this method: and it is that the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then the area of the rupture of the abscesses is dried with incision along the width according to the amount of three days.
And then press the white hip that is under the buttock until it is uncovered.
And then take the ray (likely a type of instrument) and place it on the prominent area of the hip, and press it to the navel (or abdomen).
And then sew the two prominent areas above the hip's extremity of the ray, and join one of them to the other with stitches.
And then remove the extremity of the ray, and do not sever the hip completely, nor extend the wound, nor any other thing like this, as I wish to make you understand in the treatment of an intestinal hernia.
And then treat that with the treatment for sores, and as you would dress wounds, cleanse it and restore the sore until it is healed; for the hip is contracted and the rupture's prominence is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this location, for it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
Of the softening of the testicles' swelling.
Many times the swelling of the testicles in some men is softened by this, because the tissues surrounding it are softened, and his care is needed.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one treating him to have the patient lie on his back, and to apply any softened swelling over the natural swelling; then to sew the two edges together with sutures.
And if you wish, sew the excess of softened swelling at the beginning with three or four stitches, and with firm sutures.
And then cut between the sutures; and then treat with the treatment for other wounds until he is healed and the pus subsides.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration, in our law, is forbidden, but, for a reason, I am obliged to mention it in this book.  This mention is not necessary except for two reasons:  one, so that when a physician is questioned about it, he knows how to treat the condition to which it applies; and the other, that we often have need to castrate other animals for our own benefit, such as bulls, goats, pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by a fissure or incision.
However, in the method of castration by crushing, the procedure is to immerse the animal in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed, hanging down. And then take them with your hand until they are broken and no longer appear beneath the touch.
But in castration by fissure and incision, you must hold the animal and press the scrotum with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and make an incision on each testicle until both are separated.
And then cut them further once you have scraped off each. And do not leave any cause of the inflammation on them, only the fine inflammation that is on the vessels.
And this method of castration, which is done by rubbing, is better, for a strong rubbing leaves no cause in the testicles for the animal to desire mating.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Of the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when a space appears in the scrotum, in the area between the testicles, shaped like a woman's vulva with hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that area in the scrotum.
But in women, it's a different type: the woman's vulva on the pubis resembles a pair of male testicles, somewhat small and protruding outward like the foreskin of a man and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: for two types of men and one type of women. And it is necessary to cut the adhered flesh until the inflammation subsides, and then treat those wounds with the treatment for other injuries.
And in the second type of man, where there is urine in the scrotum, there is no treatment or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of swelling and prominent flesh due to female causes.
A slight swelling, caused by natural factors, will subside and become less noticeable; sometimes, however, it becomes exaggerated in some women to the point of spreading like it does in men and hindering intercourse.
Then you should remove the excess swelling with your hand or with a lancet.
And do not use the lancet excessively, especially at the root of the swelling, so that it does not cause a flow of blood.
And then treat it with the treatment for sores until it is healed.
But flesh that arises in the womb of the mother until it fills it, and which then emerges on the body's surface, resembling a tail (and thus some initially called this "tailed disease"); therefore, we must treat it like a swelling, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Of the treatment of elephantiasis.
Elephantiasis is when the vagina of the woman is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to an illness that preceded it, and that illness is caused either by flesh not fitting properly or by a subtle or thick film.
And it is caused either in the region of the mother's womb, or in her ribs, or in the uppermost part of her body, or in the lowermost part, and you prohibit cooking, and ingestion, and childbirth, and strongly prohibit menstruation.
And the knowledge of this is determined by observing the woman, if the blockage is apparent, immediately; but if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the blockage is due to a subtle film, and it is close to the two lips, then you cook and break it apart.
And you place powders on the two lips, and then place your index fingers from both hands on top of them.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then forcefully extend the two lips until that subtle film is broken and the blockage is opened.
And then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and let the person lie with it on top during the day so that the incised area does not become solid.
But if the film is thick and dense, then it is necessary that you cut it with a sharp blade or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the blockage is due to flesh, then suspend that with a hook, and cut it.
And have with you the medicines that stop blood flow without causing pain, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and vinegar, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal quickly.
And keep that for several days and apply warm compresses.
And then it should be treated with further healing treatment until it is completely healed.
And sometimes it happens in the main birth of other tissues, and then it is necessary to cut them according to this method. However, if this is due to a brain abscess, the brain abscess which is in the main part should not be treated with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids, and of cuts and red swellings that occur in the vagina of women.
Hemorrhoids are understood as the openings of many veins through which much blood flows continuously; and when they are old hemorrhoids and are formed into lumps.
And I have already discussed the types of these [hemorrhoids] and their symptoms, and will now state which ones receive treatment and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and lumps, when they are inside the rectum and do not appear to the touch, then no iron-based treatment should be done on them.
But those which are at the opening of the rectum, where one can feel them, are those that can be treated.
And you should place the woman in a cool place, and then remove the lump with scissors, or a rough cloth, and cut them at the roots.
Then sprinkle over them the flow of blood from one of the cutting powders without biting, like acacia and similar ones.
And then you should soak their feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make them sit in a decoction of pomegranate rind, quince rind, and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with it on their back.
And if the blood has stopped, good; and if not, apply two leeches, and to the breasts without incision.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice, or arugula juice, or hedge-nettle juice with diluted wine, and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of a bone fracture in the arm.
Many types of abscesses occur in the arm, such as cancers, stony abscesses, ulcers, tumors, herpes, fistulas, hemorrhoids, sores, and other abscesses. And I have already described these illnesses and their types, their symptoms, and their cures in the previous sections.
And it is necessary for me to discuss in this treatise the abscess that comes on the arm when it is one of the abscesses that collects pus, and if you wish to know how the operation with iron is performed.
Therefore, you must consider if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with throbbing and phlegm and fever, and if there is redness and if pressure on it elicits a sensation, then do not hurry with puncturing it, and treat it with what helps maturation until the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman lie on a bed frame with two supports; and recline her on her side and position her feet at the lower part of her abdomen, and her thighs should be spread out, and place her arms under her armpits, and bind each limb with appropriate bandages.
And then the midwife stands by the right side and administers the instrument with which the opening in the womb is made, the form of which will be detailed in the following steps.
And when you wish to administer this instrument, you should insert, with the tip, the depth of the woman's womb, and what enters the womb from the instrument should be no more than the depth of the womb and leave the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the depth of the womb, then you must place powders on the lining of the womb, so that the entrance of any instrument into the womb is prevented.
And you must place the wick that is on the instrument on the upper side, and have the person administering the instrument turn the wick until the opening of the womb is made.
And when the discharge appears, and it is touched with the hand and is bloody and wet, then you must dry that area around the head with a linen cloth.
And when the discharge is evacuated, then you must place a cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, in which some astringent substance is present, on the wound, and place the compress over the section within the womb.
And place outside the womb, and over the perineum, a clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then it should be treated for about two days with an ointment suitable for this purpose until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed in this way, so that it is cleansed with water and honey, and then with water in which iris root or long-stalked aristolochia has been boiled, and then returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the womb, then you must refrain from treating it with iron, having cure it with what we have said in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives how to treat living embryos when they develop in a non-natural manner.
It is necessary for the midwife to recognize the signs of a natural birth at the outset.  For example, when you see the woman pushing downwards, desiring to smell the air, and relieved by the weight of the birth upon her, and hurrying the birth of the embryo, know that this birth is according to the natural form.  The expulsion of the embryo is above its head, and the placenta either hanging or suspended by the umbilical cord.
Therefore, when you see these signs, the abdomen should be pressed so that the embryo descends easily, because when it descends upon its head, it leaves the placenta behind, which is then cleaned of excess material through proper purification.
However, a birth that is different from this is unnatural and undesirable. For when the embryo emerges feet-first and the body emerges before the head and feet, or one hand or foot emerges first, or the head and one hand emerge, or the head emerges and the body falls to one side, this is a sign of unnatural and undesirable births.
Therefore, it is essential for the midwife to be knowledgeable and astute about all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of those things, and what the meaning is in them, so that it is signified by this and understood through this.
When the child is born headfirst through a natural process, and the delivery is difficult for the woman, and her strength is weakened, then have her sit up, or have the women who are assisting her hold her, and evaporate the heat from her with collected fenugreek and with moist oils.
And then the midwife should insert her fingers between the mother's buttocks, using them to separate the placenta, or cut it with her nail until she removes the moisture that remains in it. And press on the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman should be treated with a poultice of linseed and a poultice of fenugreek with cumin.
And then command the patient, or the attendant, to be pressed and made to sneeze with warm cloths; and hold their mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled soon.
And if both hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you should gently return them slowly. But if you do not succeed with the internal manipulation, then place the woman on a table and lift her feet up, and then tilt the table towards the ground; and the woman should be held to prevent her from falling during the thrusting.
And if the hands are not returned and the fetus dies, then cut them open and extract the remains of the fetus or tie the body to the patient's hand with cloth and extract it carefully, for that will be expelled.
When the fetus is on its feet, you should push it upwards, then gently turn the fetus, then grasp it, then take one of its feet and extend it slowly.
But when it has come out between the thighs, then you tell it to strain, and make it cough with care, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have described, then you return the fetus slowly until you place it in its natural position, for it will then be expelled with ease.
And if it is still not expelled by all that we have described, then take marshmallow and dissolved gum, and pound it thoroughly in a mortar, then apply it to the lower part of the woman's abdomen, the lower part of her belly. And then apply this poultice to warm water, until the hypochondria (lower ribs/side area) are affected.
And when the parts below it are soothed, then give the patient a fumigation of myrtle, and apply it to them. And when the fumigation has lasted for an hour, then you place it on a bedpan, and make it cough and hold its mouth, and remove it, and gently compress the lower part of its abdomen, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
The fetus comes out lengthwise with one of its hands. If the reduction of the hand is successful, but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her move.
And if moving does not work, then have her lie down on the bed, and forcefully compress her thighs, and then administer remedies which I have previously described made of mucilages.
And if labor has begun, then have her sit on a stool, and then carefully attempt the reduction of the hand, drawing the fetus into its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and tell her to push until it is expelled.
The fetus is now lying on its back, with its arms outstretched and its face towards its mother's side. The midwife should hold the child's hand and then gently and gradually turn it, helping it with ease.
And when it is placed correctly, then apply to its head what we have described, consisting of oil and mucilages.
Then instruct him to breathe in small, shallow breaths, and when that is done, have her sit on a stool, and instruct her to lean over to her right side, and then instruct her to push; and make her sneeze with appropriate instructions. The prepared fetus is positioned on its side.
When the mother's labor is over in this way, carefully consider, and then you cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until all the moisture is expelled.
And if the fetus is suspended by its face and neck, then cut it at the navel, so that it is not held back and dies.
Then push the fetus into the parts within until you place it in the proper position, and tell the woman to bear down a few times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
The birth of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born quite often, and sometimes three or four, but this is rare and seldom happens; however, such things are contrary to nature, and are not alive.
And count those, whether they are numerous, as second children, and separate them by section, distinguishing them by the ligament at the navel of each.  And sometimes they are expelled like a single fetus by a gentle, natural means, and sometimes by an unnatural means, as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult to deliver, and reach the point we have discussed regarding unnatural births, then treat them as we have described.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and subtlety, and with diligence, and is ingenious according to every figure, as it is prepared by ingenious means leading to health.
A recollection of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten are formed in the mother's womb.  I have verified that one woman miscarried six, and another ten, all formed, the cause of which was determined by the learned sages' measurements.
And all of this should be part of the midwife's knowledge, for it is easily apparent to one familiar with this, and thus one should address it with what is appropriate.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with the methods we have described in the division of medicine, and it has not yet emerged, and you are forced to use manual procedures, then you must consider whether the woman is of healthy constitution and free from any of the conditions that might endanger her life.
Then the woman should be positioned on her back, with her head lowered and her thighs raised.
And the attendant should hold her (the woman) in place, either by holding her in two places or by securing her to the bed, so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
And then moisten the mother's mouth with moist oils, and with mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
Then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where she can hook her fingernails onto the fetus.
And suitable places for this:  then consider if the fetus is prepared to descend from its head, and then you hook your fingers onto its brow/forehead, or the neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or in the fork of the throat, or in the appropriate areas of the ribs, or below the lower ribs.
But if the descent is toward the feet, then in the groin, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the fingernail with the right hand, and place the curve of it in that spot which is between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and hook the fingernail into one of those places we mentioned, until it reaches the empty space/cavity.
And then place and hook another fingernail, or a third if necessary, so that there is a pulling inward, and not an outward extension according to its nature alone.
And it should be moved in all directions, so that its expulsion is eased, just as is done when a tooth is removed.
And it is necessary in that place between them that the extension be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert those fingers and move what is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the fet is pushed out, then the fingernail(s) should be moved to the next spot that is further in/up; and do this until the entire fet is pushed out.
But if the hand is protruding before the other, and it is not possible to return it by squeezing it, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then pull it back until it is completely expelled, and cut it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus it is necessary that you do the same for the other hand and for the two feet.
But if the head of the fet is large, or squeezing it causes pain, or water is collected at its head, then it is necessary to insert fingers between the bony spaces, cut open the head and drain the water, or to cut it open with an instrument called "alundat", the shape of which will be found among the other instruments in the chapter following this one.
And similarly, do the same if the fet is naturally large-headed: then it is necessary to cut it with a scalpel, or to remove it with a "alunda" as we said; then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has protruded and is squeezed towards the fork, then it should be cut open until the moisture in the foot is discharged.
But if it is not complicated, nor does it cause pain, then you cut the head as soon as possible.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is abscessed or hydrops, then you must pierce it until the moisture within is drained.
But if the fet is upon its feet, then the pulling of it is gentle and its direction towards the mother's mouth is gentle.
But if it is squeezed towards the belly and foot, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and cut open the belly and foot until that which is within them is drained.
But if the other limbs are removed and the head remains, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she inserts her hand into the air passage and seeks the head with it, and pulls it with her fingers towards the mother's mouth, and then inserts one or two fingers into it and pulls it with those.
And if the mother's mouth is blocked by a burning abscess that has occurred there, then it should not be disturbed; instead, a flushing with moist, greasy substances should be administered first. And apply poultices; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetuses is on its side, then if possible, it should be turned; and that which we have said regarding a living fetus should be administered.
And if this is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave no cause within the second layer (of the womb or the body).
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer that which we have said about the treatment of boils which arise from the mother (i.e., the mother's body).
And if a flow of blood occurs, then you should apply astringent waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus, and then, again, became pregnant, and another dead fetus was the result. A long time ago, a boil occurred on his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat him, and medicated him for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
Then I placed some strong-drawing plasters on him, and a bone came out, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was greatly astonished, as there are no bones in the belly.
And then I thought they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I treated the wound, and removed many bones; the woman, being in her usual state, and having lived in this way for a long time, discharged a little pus.
And I did not consider this strange, but rather that it is knowledge and a help to what the skilled physician administers with his hand in treatment.
Of the forms of the instruments needed to extract the fetus.
Form of the twisting with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of constriction in which the books are tied, in which constriction are two twists at the two ends of two cords. However, this twist should be more subtle than a constricting band, and be made either of linen or of wood.
And the width of each cord should be about two fingers and the margin of each about one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle of the two cords are two fastenings of the same cord, already fastened, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that it may be opened by them when you revolve the two prescribed twists.
Another form similar to this one, more subtle and lighter:
It should be made of linen or wood, resembling forceps. However, at the end of it are two additions like this, and the length of those additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you wish to open the mother with them, then you have the woman lie on the bed with her feet hanging down, opening what is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument like you would with scissors, in the amount you want, based on the opening of the mother's mouth, until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
A method of pushing with which the fetus is pushed:
A method of applying pressure/support with which the large head is contained.
And it is similar to forceps, which have teeth at the end, as often happens, and sometimes it is made long like forceps, in this way, as often happens, with teeth like saw teeth with which it is incised and contained. A method of gentle pressure/support.
A method of using a hook with a spine/point.
A method of using a hook with two spines/points.
A method of a spatula with two extremities, with which the head is severed/cut off.
A method of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments are used, and the more the species of them are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the easier their operation becomes and the more valuable they are to men due to their quantity.
And do not neglect those instruments, wherever they may be, and whatever you have at your disposal, for the necessity of them cannot be excused.
Of the extraction of the second/secondary thing.  (or "second part")
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a stimulus, and firmly press your hand over her mouth and nostrils.  If by this it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then you take a bowl, pierce a hole in the cover, and place in it herbs, opening the mother's mouth [or, placing in her mouth] such as camomile, rue, anise, chamomile, Arabic cicadas, cassia wood, and centaury. All of these herbs, or some of them, should be immersed in water in the bowl, and place that on the fire.
Then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's cavity.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it hasn't been expelled, then you order the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or in a mixture of marshmallow, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it.  And once she has found it, take it and gently pull it out bit by bit.  But if it is attached to the mother's womb, then insert her hand as we have described, and when she finds the afterbirth, remove it slowly and gradually, so that the mother does not suffer from a violent pull. Beforehand, it should be gently moved from side to side.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and with the herbal oil medication.
But if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself out by further attempts at extraction.  Instead, whatever remains in the mother's mouth, put it on the woman's thigh, and then treat it with an ointment and a four-ingredient preparation. This will cause it to decompose over a few days, dissolve, and be expelled.
But when it decomposes, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this afflicts the patient.  Then, fumigation and appropriate remedies must be administered.
However, some of the ancients already tested fumigation with dried nettles and figs.
Form of instrument with which the woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and the afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or earthenware.
And the slender end should be placed in the vessel, and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed above the flames of the fire.
And let the one who holds it ensure that the fumigation is consumed and replace it with another.
Of the treatment of the unperforated anus of the child.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which are then narrow and obstructed. Therefore, the midwife should perforate that constriction with her finger; and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the sphincter.
And then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to swallow.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a plague or abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then treated with what we have said about the treatment and the use of lead.
Of the treatment of fistulas that come from below.
Fistulas that develop in the lower, more posterior region, are swollen and large, and develop either near the anus externally or within the space of the lower region.
And it is a fistula or abscess.
And when this swelling is longstanding and comes from watery white moisture or subtle putrefaction, and sometimes these fistulas are even penetrating.
And those that are penetrating are known by the discharge and windiness that comes from them; and sometimes the patient experiences discharge, and often worms come out of them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the bladder, and into the urethra; and some of these penetrating ones reach the joint of the thigh and the area of the buttock.
And the way to distinguish a penetrating fistula from a non-penetrating one in the anus is to insert your index finger into the anus, and subtly insert a thin instrument of bronze or iron into the fistula if there is no twisting.
But if there is twisting in that area, then insert a thin instrument of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the instrument or hair against your finger.
And if you do not feel any of that, nor does any discharge, worms, or windiness come from the opening, as we have said, then know it is non-penetrating, and then focus on the treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, the sign of that is urine from it, and prohibiting it until the area is healed with medicine.
But if it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone, and pain arises in the surrounding area, the sign of it is that the probe penetrates, if there is no twisting within the bone, and pain arises in the surrounding part; and that it will likely persist; and that no treatment, nor ointment, will be effective in that case.
And for all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment of those is the work and vanity of unskilled physicians, upon which you should not rely.
But for that which is not penetrating and not old, healing by cauterization is expected, as I have told you, and which I have already tested.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on their back, and lift their legs upwards, their thighs bent towards their stomach, and then introduce a lead probe, or an iron one if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know the spot where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, then you should introduce your finger into the anus.
And if, when you feel the probe already penetrating on your finger, you feel something between your finger and that tissue or flesh, then know for certain that it is penetrating; and therefore do not work on it, for there is no healing in that, as we have said.
But however, some might say that it heals in some men slowly.
And the treatment through which one expects improvement in them is that you should heat a fine cautery according to the fistula's width, as previously described, and introduce that heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those tissues that are joined and fistula-like, similar to a bird's feather quill, are burned.
And then treat that with some dressings until all the burned tissues are healed, and then treat it with medicines that generate and strengthen flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate your finger that is in the anus, and between that and the probe is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and the fistula opens where the surface of the rectum is, then cauterize the rectum from the beginning of the fistula, and you must cauterize with the probe, and hold it in the fistula until the cauterization reaches the place where the tip of the probe is, and by the probe it is liberated and extracted.
And then cleanse those fistula-like tissues, which are like a bird's feather quill, and do not leave any cause of them.
However, if bleeding occurs between you and your procedure when you burn those tissues, then the best and easiest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire has two good uses:  it burns those joined tissues, and it cuts off the blood and dries the moisture.
And then treat that with dressings made of lint or a crushed cloth until the wound is closed, and then treat the sore with ointments that generate and strengthen tough flesh.
And those medicines, which are astringent and drying; when this is restored, it is already healed and you need not fear a recurrence.
But if the fistula has already pierced through to the anus and is extending from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and probe with it.
And therefore, if you feel a resistance and between you and it is a membrane or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no surgery to be done there but rather to proceed with a method of trust and hope.
Which case can be treated in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or cut it until you reach its cavity, so you can insert medicaments and achieve a cure; and do not proceed too much with cutting, so as not to injure the surrounding flesh, causing the patient unnecessary suffering, and then treat it with what we have said; for it will be easily healed; or separate that membrane and remove the pus that dries the flesh towards the anus, as we have said, with a probe or other instrument with a sharp end; then cleanse that fistulous flesh that is in the cut until you can apply a scab; and then strive to heal the entire wound with a cut, and if the outer opening is not healed, and the fistula remains open in the area of the anus, the patient will get better more easily. And sometimes the fistula is resolved in this manner: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the folds of the anus near the surface of the body, along with the crease and at the edge of the anus, then take a probe with a pointed end, which is like a needle prepared for making incisions in this way:
and insert it into that [fistula] wrapped in five [threads] or around them; and then insert the probed thread into the fistula until it reaches its cavity.
But if it penetrates the edge of the anus, close to the interior, then you remove the thread from that hole as if you were inserting your finger into the anus; and you extract the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each, and leave it for a day or two, and whenever you cut the thread into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh is cut between the two ends of the thread and it falls out.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and cured.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in any way you are prepared, but not too deeply into the flesh, for it is not your job to do so lest you cut the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the probe with which the fistula is opened:  its curve is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so as not to cut what is unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, for either they are between the buttocks, resembling a bunch of grapes, or they are like bunches of raisins. And they are small or large, and the blood flows from them constantly, and are single or multiple, and are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the degree of little moisture, from which flows yellowish water or a little blood with a continuous consistency, and according to the color of the consistency.
And the treatment for those inside the anus is to instruct the patient to sit and press until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear before you. Then you grasp them and suspend them with tweezers or with your nails, and then cut them off at their roots.
However, if the tweezers are not holding them due to their moisture and softening, then take them with a rough cloth or cotton or wool bandage, and pull them out with your fingers, and then cut them off and sprinkle some warm powders over the cuts, so that these powders act in place of cauterization; or cauterize them as it is preceded in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not open, then cauterize the patient with a cautery that has a small bite, and wash with that which is in the anus, and have it open slightly when the patient is straining.
However, if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause is mild, and you should grasp them with your finger or tweezers, cut them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And for those that you have cut, you should apply sutures to them in this manner: take a linen thread and thread it onto a needle.  Then, pull the hemorrhoids to the outward edges, and have the needle penetrate the base on the opposite side. Tie the two ends of the thread to the part below the needle, in a horizontal manner. Tightly draw the hemorrhoid together with the suture, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
Do this to all of them, and leave one of them unsewn, so that the excess blood can drain from that one.
Then place a cloth soaked in warmed oil or a plaster over the anus and instruct the patient to rest. Then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointments or other remedies until it is healed.
And if they are old and do not respond to that treatment, then you should scrape them with the point of a spatula or your fingernail until they are moist and the crust of pus above them, which prevents their consolidation, is removed; then treat them until they are healed.
Then you should scrape them with a more forceful scraping than the first until much blood is drawn and they are raw; then treat them until they are healed.
Know that ulcers, this is key, are not anything but a round, reddish spot on the body, resembling a little nail head, and they occur throughout the body, especially below the feet and in the joints, and they are often associated with pain in that area.
Then it is necessary to cut around the ulcer, holding it with forceps or tweezers, and remove it from its root; and then treat that area.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is prescribed in its chapter.
However, a wart is a small, rough, fistulous, round elevation on the surface of the body, and often appears on the hands of children.
And the treatment for it is to scrape and cut it, or to squeeze it with a file or with a needle until it bursts. And if you wish, cauterize this, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
However, a pimple is a small, pustular or fistulous, large elevation on the surface of the body, often found on the groin, and when the cold touches it, a sensation like an ant bite is felt around the body.
And the cure for it is to take a hollow tube of an eagle's or hawk's feather, and it should be strong. Place that over the pimple until it contains the circle of the pimple's parts; then, turn your hand with the tube until you cut what is within the pimple's circle, and place it on the groin of the flesh, and let the pimple be eradicated from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of bronze or iron according to this method:
Let the part above the tube be thin, closed (that is, unperforated), wrapped so that the grasp of it on the skin is smoothed and its rotation is facilitated.
And if you wish to cauterize the pimple, do so as previously described in the cauterization of a boil in the chapter on cauterization.
Concerning the instruments that are used in giving treatment.
Sometimes treatment is done with silver or brass or cast or hammered bronze; and sometimes it is done with small and large instruments, depending on the patient's condition, for the treatment of young children requires smaller instruments; and for those with sore or painful bottoms, the treatment instruments should be small.
The form of large and small treatments:
The head of the cannula above it, to which the pouch is attached, should be wide in this manner; and it should have a distinct attachment point where the pouch is attached, just as before.
And the lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be tightly closed (that is, not open) very narrowly, tapering to a point; and on one side of it there should be two openings, and on the other side one opening, and the size of the openings should be according to the thickness of the rays and a little larger.
And the pouch, in which the bladder medicines or sheepskin are placed, should be a palm in length.
And it should be pierced with many holes, just as it is rolled; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of the finger.
And then insert strong, crude (or raw) bile, about ten ounces or thereabouts, into those holes; and attach the pouch to that; and when the pouch is placed in the proper location, tie the top of the applicator tightly between two distinct points, with strong constriction, and then seal each hole with that.  However, the manner of sealing is that you fill the pouch with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
And then the patient should lie on their back, raise their legs up, and place a blanket or linen underneath them; and then anoint the end of the cautery with oil or egg white or mucilage of fenugreek or similar; and then insert that into the anus with ease, and then the attendant should take the pouch and squeeze it with both hands forcefully until everything in the applicator has been emptied into the intestines; and then remove the applicator, and the patient lowers their legs to the floor.
And if the medicine causes a response, hold it in place for as long as possible; and if the patient sleeps with it all night, it is better in terms of recovery.
However, if you use this cautery for diseases of the bowels and their expulsion, repeat the cautery until healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or festering sores in the anus, the applicator should be very thin and gentle, like the applicators used for children.
Concerning the treatment of plagues.
I have already stated in the division of plague treatment what was appropriate for the book, and I now say that the treatment of those plagues is by hand and by medicine according to the condition.
Therefore, I say that plagues are diversified according to how the plagues are caused and according to the location where the plagues appear.
And the causes by which plagues are often caused are like the throwing of a stone, or the cut of a knife or sword, or a blow with a lance, or a stick, or an arrow, or similar things from many causes.
But the plagues that are in the parts of the body are like a plague that falls on the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the liver, and similar parts of the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of certain plagues, so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the recollection of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone throw or similar, and has only slightly cracked the skull, and is a significant wound, and you fear the onset of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should quickly bleed from the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and draw from him a quantity of blood according to the strength of the patient, unless some cause prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood that has come from the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be on the opposite side of the wounded part; and keep the patient from repletion and from rich foods and drinks.
But if any reason prevents bloodletting, then the diet should be reduced, and he should avoid meat and wine.
And if an abscess develops on the wound, apply a poultice of roasted olive oil or wine in which a styptic has been dissolved.
But if you are sure of a hot abscess, then apply to the wound, if it is recent, its own blood, and if the air hasn't altered the powder that I will mention shortly.
And if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or from a cut or similar injury, and its edges are not brought together by flaps, then bring them together with sutures, as I will explain about their stitching.
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendon, and there is no retention but only a small suspension, then cut it, and then treat the wound with medicines and rebuild the flesh in a suitable place, and command the patient to eat foods rich in substance: heads and whole pieces of meat and similar, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the flesh that does not adhere to the bone, then you cut away all the putrid material and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood may flow, and it is not severed by medicines, then you seek out the artery, and if you find it unsevered, then you cut it with a scalpel, or tie it off; and if necessity compels you that what we have said is not sufficient, then you cauterize it until the blood flow is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is slight; therefore you can powder them with this powder, for it will consolidate them before the air alters them.
And the method for the powder is this: take one part of oil of linseed, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unquenched causs (likely a type of burning material/ash).  Grind it all finely and sift it, then fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly until it adheres well and is coagulated by the blood.
And then bind it over with dressings and leave it, and do not unbind it until it is suppurated, for the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
And sometimes this alone suffices, when you do not have linseed and dragon's blood at hand.
And you perform this same procedure on large wounds when it is appropriate to apply it, and they are tightly bound, and on fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially in summer, then this powder is not the intended treatment, but rather treat them with what we have said, or apply digestive ointments, or a poultice of barley flour mixed with water and honey until it forms a crust. Then treat them with the other remedies until they are healed.
But if the wound is accompanied by a fractured bone, and it is small, then you remove it with a dressing.
And I will describe the treatment for head fractures in what follows.
Of wounds to the neck.
But if the wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between a wound on the neck and a simple head wound.
But if the nerve or artery of the neck is cut, then if it is a nerve, it should not be treated with anything that causes harsh astringency, like zinc and verdigris (which is vitriol and similar to them), for they harm the nerves and constrict them. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if this is treated with mild medicines, such as washing with clean water, sometimes infused in oiled or un-oiled herbs, and salves when washed with clean water, and other softening stones according to this method, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or constrict its edges, and then treat it with powders until healed.
But if the wound is deep or the injury has reached the lowermost part of the bone, then perforate it at the deepest point.
But if an artery is already cut in the wound and blood is flowing, then separate or stop the flow, or tie it off, or cauterize it if the need arises.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or the whole spine have been cut, and the veins of the neck are spared, then you should close the edges of the wound with sutures along the neck, and do not touch it. First, align it and return it to its natural shape, then hold it with a suitable splint, and leave it for a few days. Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and healing properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has already affected the bone, then you should treat it, and if there are bone fragments, remove all you can; and those you cannot, leave them until the wound becomes pus-filled, and the discharge is lessened.
And if the wound is recent, then powder the area with the powder that you have been recommended. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with whatever the recollection brings forth in its chapter.
If it's a wound from a spear or a knife, and sometimes the depth of the wound, then consider further if there is airiness from the wound as the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if there is no depth to the wound, and the wound is recent with its own blood, then in the first hour you put powder on it, and do not press it so that the blood is not retained in the depth of it and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but put an attractive ointment on it, and apply it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not present, then you place a piece of old cloth over the wound opening to absorb the moisture; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that the accumulated material drains out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound, and the patient shows no spasms, tremors, or bad heart conditions, or constrictions of the windpipe, and the other bodily functions are good, then know that the wound is salvageable; and then treat it with poultices and other remedies until it is healed.
But if healing is impossible, and the wound is always open, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore treat it according to its own specific treatment.
And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or sword, and it is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with sutures if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if the wound has already penetrated the bone, and pieces of bone are now exposed, then you should clean the wound and try to remove those pieces if they are loose. But if they are not loose, then leave them until the wound can heal, for removing them would be harmful.
And for other wounds that occur on other limbs, the method of treatment is the same as what we have described.
Of wounds of the belly.
The ailment which occurs in the belly is either severe, mild, or moderate.
A small rupture is difficult to repair in another way, and the reduction of them is more difficult if you don't quickly return the protrusion to its place, because it will widen and become larger, making its return difficult.
Therefore, the best rupture is moderate, because in that case the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, unlike the two types previously mentioned.
And know that the suturing of the belly is according to four methods, but two of these sutures are common and suitable for suturing other parts of the body.
And two other sutures are specific to the other parts of the body, but nonetheless more specific to suturing the belly.
And I will explain each to you with explanation and declaration.
Therefore, I say that when the rupture is small and some part of the intestine has come out through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either due to the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is the case, it is necessary that you warm it, either by submerging a damp sponge or cloth in lukewarm water alone, or by soaking it in water with cumin, cypress, and spike, and apply that to the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes, this is done with vinegar, which has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And when you see the inflammation resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and marsh-mallow have been boiled, for this alleviates the internal discomfort with little effort.
But if the internal discomfort is relieved by this treatment, then gently enlarge the rupture with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is done properly and without incision, and there should be no attempt to dry it out when it is needed and weakens.
Concerning the instrument, consider its shape:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the tip is fine, but not as fine as a needle; rather, it is slightly blunt.
And so, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine is outside, then its return should be according to its natural form, back into its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is wide, and it is in the lower part of the belly, then you must have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you should raise the head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then always keep your attention and consideration on this, so that the part where the wound is may be higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then have the attendant hold the rupture completely with their hand and bring the edges together, and then examine whether there is some cause for further sutures.
And this is the common method of suture: one takes the needle, or several needles according to the size of the wound; and then place it on the edge of the rupture with the ring finger, and hold the needle firmly so that you do not push the two ends of the thread into the two ends of the bandage underneath the threads in the affected area, until you have pushed the needle from that side; and you have already joined the two ends of the thread and the two ends of the bandage, and you have made four stitches.
And then tighten with double thread around the needle, and sometimes from both sides together, and then bring the two edges and the wound together properly; and then leave the thickness of a finger and place another needle in it, and then tie it with thread like the first needle; and do not stop doing this if necessary with the needles until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And the needles should be of medium thickness, neither too thin nor too thick, because thin needles easily pierce the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to thread, so for this reason they should be of medium thinness and thickness.
And it is not appropriate to stick the needle into both ends of the thread too close together, so that the flesh is not pierced easily and that the wound bursts before it heals.
And do not make the stitches too long, so that the wound is hindered from healing.
And then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not bother the patient during their rest; and you will place expanded powders on the stitches, all around, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed.
And this type of stitching with needles is most suitable for small wounds, for in stitching them, only one or two needles, or thereabouts, are needed.
However, the second stitch is common: and it is that you sew the four ends of the thread and the two ends of the chip (or strip), all at once, with a needle which should be equally wrapped in a subtle and robust way.
And then, when you have pierced these four ends with the needle, pull the needle back from the same point where you began, so that the thread retracts from the most superior part of the wound, so that the stitching is like a woven cloth, as if the cloths are woven together tightly.
And place between each stitch the thickness of the little finger.
And this stitching is known (or, understood) by men.
And with such stitching, I sutured the wound that had occurred to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife.  The wound was a gaping tear over a palm’s breadth, and the intestines had protruded about two palms from the middle of the wound and were exposed halfway down the limb.  And so, I restored it after the intestines had been outside the wound for 24 hours.
And the wound was consolidated within 15 days or so, and I healed him. He recovered; and afterward, he lived for many years, and was restored to his former abilities.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not recover; and by a miracle it was, for I did not heal him with ointment, for it was in a place where no ointment or other medicine was to be found, but I applied old wool to the wound twice a day and continuously washed it with honey water until he was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of stitches, proper according to the narration of Scripture.
And it is that you begin with a stitch of the needle, and pass the needle from the outside to the inside.
And thus, as the needle pierces the seam and the same laceration, according to its length and the entire wound, and leaves the end of the thread where you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside at the other end of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make that penetration again in that same end of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this stitch, and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside.
And penetrate with that your penetration, with which you make that penetration into the thread at the end of the wound which is on its side until all of it penetrates.
And then, starting from this same side, stitch it with the end of the thread on the other side, and remove the needle from the seam which it pierced, and then return it to that seam and stitch the end of the thread that is on the other side to this end of the wound; and remove that from the seam that is on its side.
And do this once and again, and do this once more again until you have stitched all that which is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this method of suture is that you stitch with a skin stitch, with which you sew skins, so that you stitch the thread once from the edge of the seam, and that you leave it again until you have completed it.
However, the second specific type of suture, which is called "Gualia," and which is reported by him and for him, is that you stitch it according to a semi-circular method with which some physicians stitch it, so that they bring together each part to its corresponding part on its appropriate side naturally; and they apply the end of one and the end of the wound to the other end of it, and this is done as I have explained to you.
You should insert the needle into the end of the wound close to the outside part, and have it penetrate the inside part of that wound, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and have it penetrate from the outside to the inside at two ends of the thread.
And then you turn each of these, and have each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part at two other ends of the wound, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common, superficial suture, and is a suture of which a previous reminder was given.
This is the method of Gualia.
And further, some might say, the suture of the abdomen is rectified with two needles, meaning that you thread a thread onto each, and begin by inserting the needle you have in hand, and have it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who have similarly known how to treat skin.
And know that when a rupture is in the middle part of the abdomen, then the suture of it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.
But the judgment of the treatment of plague is the judgment of other plagues.
Which means that when you obtain the plague fresh with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestine and suture it and treat it appropriately, then apply the flesh-healing powder to it.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then apply some ointments that are at your disposal until they form a hard stone and the threads fall out, and are consolidated, firm, and healed; and then treat it as the treatment of other plagues until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines available, then apply it immediately, as soon as it begins to cast off pus, and change it twice a day, as taught to you, until it is healed, for you do not require other medication in many cases when the plagues are simple.
But if you fear that the plague might spread to the major limbs, then you should soak linen in tempered olive oil, or rubbed olive oil, and place it around the affected areas, between the armpits and below the elbows.
And if there is pain or putrefaction in their intestines, which often happens, then cauterize it with black astringent wine, especially if the ulcer has reached the intestine and has created a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is easier to heal than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal, for the intestine called "jejunum" does not readily receive healing from a plague that strikes it; and this is due to the large multitude of veins within it, and the magnitude of its size, and the subtlety of its body, and because of its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if the plague's affliction is the tissue, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your technique for reducing the intestines likewise.
But if it has spread to the surrounding area and is already green or black, then you should apply a ligature over the discolored area, so that blood flows, for there are veins and arteries in the tissue.
Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and hang the two ends of the ligature from the part below the plague outside, so that the pull of the affliction from the wound in the tissue and the emission of the plague's arm is relieved.
Remembering the afflictions when they occur in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small, it is possible for it to be restored in some people. For this, I saw one who was afflicted in their belly by a spear wound; the affliction was on the right side of the stomach, and the plague was old and formed a fistula, and expulsion of gases and wind arose from it.
Then I considered the cure, knowing that it was not focused on healing, but I focused on soothing the inside so that it could heal, and the area could consolidate.
And I, having seen the area now consolidated, told the patient that an affliction might come upon them in their belly; but no such affliction occurred.  They remained in their usual state, eating and drinking, and then went into a bath and exercised as they had been doing.
And some experienced people have said that when an affliction occurs in the intestine, and it is small, it should be bound in this way: you should take large-headed leeches.  Then, bring together the two edges of the wound and place a leech with an open mouth over the two edges of the wound. When the leech has taken hold and tightly closed its mouth, cut off its head, because it adheres and does not detach.
Then place another leech near the first, and do not stop doing this with leeches, one after another, according to the size of the entire wound.
Then reduce the swelling and compress the wound; and those leech heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm comes to the patient.
And it is possible that the intestine be bound with a fine thread made from an attached animal's intestine, after it has been put on a needle; that is, take the end of this intestinal thread, which is very thin, and bind the end of it to the thread, wrapping it around, then insert the thread into needles and apply it to the intestine and then close up the rupture with this.
This method of suturing with leeches is only according to a path of trust and hope.
However, if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, because then there is only a refinement, and not a total healing of it.
Of the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it grows old and becomes chronic, and becomes an ulcer, and is not healed and discharges pus constantly and is not excised, then, in any limb, universally is called a fistula and we call it that ulcer.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, fibrous knot, with no pain, and a cavity like the cavity of a bird's nest; and therefore that ulcer is called a *rizatz* (or *rizzat*), that is, a knot.
And in some people it is moist, which discharges pus; and the moisture is easily excised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes thin, and sometimes thick, and sometimes thin.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them, and their treatment with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that I make you aware of the treatment for a fistula that is made by surgical means.
And know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for among those are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the spine, or the intestines, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the articulated joints, such as the wrist and ankle; and among these are those that are close to the main part of the limb and similar ones.
Therefore, among these fistulas that are of this type, are among the difficult-to-heal illnesses, and they do not receive healing, and effort with that is toil and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach the places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its healing, and wish to gain knowledge of it, then take a probe of iron or steel, and if the fistula goes in a straight path, then you will search for it with it.
But if the fistula is winding, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, with the lightness of its body, is suitable and easily follows the winding path.
And if the fistula has many roughnesses, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Then irrigate the openings with its openings, for the moisture with which you irrigate it flows towards the other openings and runs through them.
And then carefully investigate, according to what method you can determine if there are bones or nerves there, and if the cavity of the fistula is distant or close, or if it is a fistula with many openings, and strive with all your strength, with your questioning, asking the patient, and finding the source of the pain through your pressure with your hand on the area, and similar signs and causes, like an abscess.
And when you have considered all these issues with true observation, then proceed to the treatment with consideration:  consider whether the fistula is a superficial fistula near the surface, or in a salty place, or distant from a joint, or a nerve, or artery, or vein, or any of the locations that I have mentioned to you.
Then, dry the fistula as previously described, removing any filtering material and corrupted flesh, and anything that has grown within the opening of the flesh, or from the membrane or similar things, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of a deep location, and it is deemed appropriate, then it is necessary to incise it as deeply as possible, and then clean it of all its corrupted flesh; and then apply some wraps with sharp medicinal agents and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have opened with an instrument.
And do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine dissolves everything that remains in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then you must investigate it and cauterize it, as we have described, if you do not find any reason for a vein, nerve, or main limb to be the cause, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness on it, then you should scrape that until all corruption is removed; and then treat it with what causes flesh to grow until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and still discharges pus as before, then understand that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption; and then you must once again carefully expose it, thoroughly scrape and clean it with your strongest tools, and then restore it.
And if it is healed, well and good; but if not, then understand that the corruption is located deep within the body, which cannot be reached, and therefore, there is no remedy other than to leave it be.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to extract it, then you should extract it with delicate forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then carefully remove all of them, and do not leave any part behind using your strength.
However, if you encounter any difficulty due to the humors, and there is no fear or error in their incision, then cut those ligaments or flesh if they are present, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at once, then place over the wound something that can protect it, and leave it until the flesh and ligaments around those bones are softened, and ensure that the wound does not heal, and that the incision you made in your operation remains constricted.
Furthermore, if you fear this, place on it cotton soaked in crushed olive oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, for when those ligaments soften, and the bones are separated from them, the extraction will be easier.
However, if it is a large bone, such as a bone of the leg or thigh or similar to those, and only the surface of it is corrupted, then cut that with a rasping instrument only on the back until that blackness and corruption are removed, and then repair the wound.
But if the part of the bone that is corrupted is large, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to cut around that and completely incise to the point where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it heals.
And I will now relate to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use this as an example and aid in your own operation.
There was a young man, about 30 years old, who experienced pain in his thigh, and the affliction spread from the interior of the body until the matter reached the thigh, and it was a matter of an abscess, with a large abscess, and it was not an external cause.
And then the condition was prolonged by the error of the physicians until the abscess opened, and many materials were discharged, and his healing was nearly halted until the leg became fistulous, and many openings appeared which all discharged pus and bodily humors.
And then he was treated by many physicians for about two years, and there was no skill or mastery in their treatment, until I was called in.
And I saw his leg and the materials flowing from those openings, in large amounts; and the body of that man was already emaciated, and its color was yellowish.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those openings and the probe reached the bone.
And then I carefully examined all the openings and found them extending to various parts of the leg.
And then I probed and incised one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone, and found it decayed, already earthy and corrupted and blackened; and a portion of the leg was already corrupted, having penetrated to the marrow.
Then I closed what I had discovered and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I judged that it wasn't the bone itself, but that corruption which I had cut away and closed, and I had already drained it.
And then I applied restorative medicine to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I again probed and uncovered the bone, a second time over the first discovery, and found continuing corruption with the bone.
And I closed what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was forced to perform its cure and restoration, but it was not restored.
And then I discovered it again and did not cease to cut the bone little by little, specifically, forcing its restoration, but it was not restored until I cut around a palm's width of it, and extracted its marrow, and then restored it with medicines, and it was slightly consolidated and healed.
And no further repetition of the operation and section of it is necessary except for the weakness of it, and the small tolerance and fear of death, for it suffered at all times from a bad syncope due to excessive evacuation.
And thus it is healed completely, and nothing is in place of the bone but hard flesh; and its disposition in its body is good, and its virtue returned; and it is converted to its original state, and it does not present opposition to walking, or harm in any way.
But if the bone is prominent in a place already injured, then you must cut it in this manner: you must take a ligament and tie it to the end of the prominent bone, and order someone to pull on it; and place a thicker wool ligament over the first ligament; and then tie it over the flesh below the bone, and pull the end so you pull the flesh apart, and expose the flesh over the area you wish to cut, so that the cut does not damage the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a board under the bone properly, for when you do this, the cut is not prohibited from not cutting the corrupted flesh.
And the cutting should be done slowly over the affected area, because if the corruption is inside the bone's cavity and does not appear on its surface to the senses, then the cutting needs to be repeated.
And if the bone is corrupted but not protruding, where one part is joined to the other, and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it, then you must expose all the flesh around; and then place wood underneath, and cut from one side where the corruption is until the cut continues to the other side.
And the cut should be made along the area of the corruption, a little at a time, as we said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it connects to the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not a logical/reasonable (or expected) location but rather an unexpected/abnormal one.
And if the corruption is in the flesh of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever way appears to you, and expose it, and clean it according to every possible arrangement, and with each attempt (or device)  try to correct it, as long as it doesn't damage any vein or nerve.
And know that the instruments for cutting and sawing these bones are very dependent on the position of the bones, and the preparation of them, and the thickness of them, and the subtlety, size and smallness of them, and their hardness and rarity; therefore, you must prepare a suitable instrument for each type of operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the type of instrument you need; when great study, long experience, and knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience with illnesses, exist in you, then you will already know what is appropriate for the patient regarding instruments for every illness.
And I am providing you, at the end of this chapter, a list of the instruments you will use, along with simple methods, to proceed with your treatment, which you will apply to other cases. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of a large saw:
Shape of a ray (or ray-like thing). Let the head of this ray be in the shape of a star-shaped head, and its points be in the shape of the points of a star-shaped object.
And it is only appropriate that those heads (or the points) be rubbed on the joints when they are corrupted, or if the mouth/opening is wide.
Shape of a smaller razor.
Shape of a lateral razor.  (Or, shape of a razor that is placed sideways/laterally)
The shape of a differently designed saw:  A bow should be made from it (the saw), and the blade should be sharp, made of iron, and the handle of it, a well-made wooden dagger. Form of it (or, shape of that/the one).
Shape of a razor with a concavity (or, a hollowed-out shape).
A different, more subtle shape of razor.
A different razor with a curved end.
A small razor, resembling a tentacle.
A smaller cutting instrument (or blade).
Another cutting instrument; this one resembling a ray, and its end is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the treatment of bones.
A type of ray that is suitable for the treatment of a bone that has been perforated.
And its tip is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, all the instruments we have mentioned, razors, cutting instruments, and saws, should be.
Of the cutting edges and the sawing of bones.
The extremities [of the bone] might be damaged either by an internal or external cause, or if you have treated the corruption by those remedies and the cure doesn't work, or if the corruption has extended to a limb which wasn't originally affected, then it's necessary that you cut into that limb where the corruption has spread, so that the patient escapes death or severe harm which is a greater impairment of the limb.
And the sign of that which has happened to it [the limb] is that the limb becomes black until it's burned as though by fire, or it might become dark until the hardness spreads into that limb and consumes the entire body; and therefore, cut into that [affected area].
And similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the impact of certain poisonous things, such as the sea scorpion, or viper, or weasel, and similar ones.
And if the corruption or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then you cut off the finger, and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.
And similarly, if it reaches the hand, then you cut it off at the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread so that it affects the arm's forearm.
And if instead of that, then cut the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond the elbow, then in that case is the death of the patient; and administering any other treatment for this is a waste of effort.
And similarly, do the same for the foot. When corruption reaches the toe of the foot, then you cut it off down to one of the bones (joints).
And if it spreads to the sole of the foot, then you cut off the entire foot. But if it rises to the knee, then you cut the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no cure possible but only to let the patient go and allow them to die.
And the way to cut or sever the limb is that you tighten the ligament in the part below the one you want to cut, and tighten another ligament over the spot; and the surgeon extends one ligament downwards, and the surgeon extends another ligament upwards; and you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, making a wide space until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be cut or severed.
And it is necessary to place cloths on all sides so that the area does not touch anything, and that the patient receives appropriate and carefully applied poultices and dressings.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while working, then you cauterize the wounded spot carefully, or place some blood-stopping powders on it; and then return to your treatment until it is complete.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I relate to you what happened to a man on his foot, this same accident that I and you have discussed, which is that he got a blackening on his foot from a burn that resembled fire.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it spread to the entire foot.
And then that man prepared himself, since he saw the cure moving to the limb with the intensity of the pain and burn he felt, and he cut into that foot up to the joint, and the wound healed.
For a long time, that same corruption occurred on the tip of his index finger.
And then he came to me, and I was compelled to counteract that excess with whatever medicinal remedies I could apply to his hand, to cleanse his body; and the excess was not repelled, and it began to spread to the other fingers until it covered the entire hand.
And he urged me to cut his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the repulsion of that excess, and fearing more the death of his hand from the incision, because the patient's vitality was at its lowest ebb.
And after he left me, returned to his land, and it later came to my knowledge that that man prepared himself and cut his entire hand, and it healed.
And I have recounted this story only to provide help in understanding this illness, and to serve as an example by which it is to be understood and treated accordingly.
On the treatment of sinuses and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in any fleshy member, and the abscess cavity extends to collect pus, and it is then broken and perforated, and the pus drains out, leaving an empty space like a vessel, and the surrounding skin is like a thin cloth and has not progressed to deeper corruption, and there is no damage to the bone, nerve, or ligament, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
However, if the cavity extends so that the corruption reaches another part of the body, it is then called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment for it is to incise the entire surrounding skin, especially if it is thin and like a cloth, and to ensure that it is not adhered to the area by the corruption.
But if you suspect the skin is adhered and the corruption hasn't reached deeper tissues, and the skin shows outward progress, then you treat it with a clyster.
And if you consider it a sinus, and if it is large, and the discharge has a foul odor, then irrigate it with an Egyptian medicine made of olive oil, sour wine, and vinegar in equal parts, combined in a vessel, heated over a fire until it turns reddish and becomes like honey in consistency.
Then take what is necessary of it, dissolve it with water and honey, and irrigate the sinus with this mixture.  Press on the opening, and leave the medicine in place for two hours.
Then remove it with a poultice; and do this for as many days as needed until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.
And sometimes it is irrigated with ash water, when this medicine is unavailable to you;  and you take wood ash, put it into water, and then strain it, and irrigate the sinus with it until you are confident the sinus is healed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then irrigate the sinus with water and honey, mixed with crushed vinegar.  Or irrigate with a mixture of wine and honey, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, while wine helps to adhere the sinus, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are confident the sinus is healed, then irrigate it with something that promotes the growth of flesh in that area.
And this means taking diafinicon ointment, dissolving it in rose oil and astringent wine; or irrigating with other medicines and ointments having the properties already described in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, preventing the enema tube from entering, then widen it little by little with a small iron, and apply heat wrapped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you bring the edges together with sutures, leaving only the amount of space necessary for the enema tube to pass without obstruction.
And if the opening where the tube runs is elevated towards the upper parts, then lower it to the lowest point where the tube can run, because when the tube is constricted in the depth of the sinus, flesh will not grow there.
And if it is not possible for you to lower the sinus to the desired level of the lowest bone, then you must prepare the limb with a preparation through which the tube runs easily, in a manner that no obstacle or cause is hindering the tube's passage.
But that which is over the sinus opening must remain continuously to prevent anything blocking the tube's path. And so that you may know if what is running through the tube is much or little, or is digested or undigested.
And by this, consider the location of the sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment continues in this manner, and you see the matter discharged over the sinus opening has adhered, or shows signs of adhesion, then on the second or third day, you loosen or detach the adhesion.  When you loosen the scab, change the cloth and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus a subtle virus is spreading, do not despair of its adhesion, for healing will come to it. For some men, flesh grows slowly in their wounds, while for others, the opposite is true.
And if undigested matter has been discharged from the sinus for several days, then understand that the sinus will not adhere.  And if the sinus' adhesion is delayed and the cause prolonged, then you should adjust the drying nature of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and potency, make them dry like diafenicon ointment, when there is superfluous addition of zegi.
The final treatment is to take diafenicon ointment and dissolve it in warmed olive oil, and add old, aged wine to it, mixing it well.  Then use this.
And in similar cases, when there is no discharge, use diafenicon ointment, honey, when it is boiled until thickened, and apply it. Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, grind and powder them, then add to the honey while it's heated on the fire.  Then apply this mixture to a cloth and press it onto the sinus; or apply the thickened honey to a cloth and press that onto the sinus.
Sometimes, long, thin aristolochia root and the root of the lily of the valley (and it is the lily of the valley) are used, along with powdered eryngo and centaury. Use these herbs individually or combined, grinding and sifting them, and adding the powder to the boiled honey mentioned previously. Use this preparation.
And if the sinus condition persists and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the bone area, or in other hard parts of the body or ligaments.  Then treat it with fistula treatment, as described above.
Concerning the treatment of whitlow (panaricium), of worn-down nails, of added incisions in the finger, and of cutting.
Whitlow is an abscess that forms beneath the fingernail of the hand or foot, though it can form on other fingers as well.  When prolonged and its treatment is less successful, or when the abscess is hot, or corrupted, it releases pus, attacking the root of the nail and frequently destroying it completely, and often spreading the corruption to the bone until it smells foul, and the fingertip is blackened, and the colour is dark.
And therefore, when you have done what we have described in the division and your treatment doesn't work, then you must cut away all remaining excess nail tissue with iron and subsequently cauterize the wound, as cauterization is very helpful in this.
However, if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the nail bed’s attachments are now pressing on the surrounding flesh, causing it to become inflamed and painful, then you should insert a thin blade under the corner of the nail where it is piercing the flesh, and lift the flesh up and cut the flesh easily, then apply some corrosive, burning medicines to the remaining flesh until it is all removed; and afterwards, treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then you must cut into the bone and remove it, for a corrupted bone in that place will never heal.
And if the decay and corruption have spread to the finger, then you should cut it (the finger) at one of the joints, depending on how far the damage extends, and then treat it until it is healed.
However, if the nail has suffered a blow or friction, causing severe pain, then you should first bleed the patient, and then carefully remove the nail with a sharp blade in a transverse cut, from top to bottom.  Be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, as you will cause the patient intense pain, and it could lead to the formation of excess, inflamed tissue in the area.  Then treat that area with whatever relieves the pain.
But a swollen finger, which is common in some people's hands, is often fleshy and soft, and sometimes it is located on the bone, or sometimes on the nail.
And some of them (swellings) originate at the joint, or their origin is in certain finger joints. But the one that develops in some finger joints is not harmful, and the one that arises in the joints is very likely to be painful.
And for those that are fleshy growths, the incision should be gentle, and you should cut along its base with a blunt instrument.
But for the one that arises at the base of the joint, the treatment is difficult; therefore, be cautious about cutting it out.
However, for the one that grows on a finger near the joints, you should first cut the flesh around it in a circular incision, down to the bone.  Then, use a suitable saw to cut through the bone.  Afterwards, treat the area until healed.
But if a hardening occurs on the fingers, whether due to a birth defect, a scar from an injury, a burn, or similar causes, then it is necessary to remove that hardening until the fingers return to their normal shape.
Then place cloths soaked in warmed oil between them to prevent premature healing, and separate them, or place a thin sheet of lead between them until they heal properly.
And similarly, if hardening occurs on the fingers near the palm, then you should remove that hardening, in a manner appropriate to the shape of the limb.
Of incisions of the veins, these are varicose veins.
Varicose veins are swollen, thick veins filled with melancholic superfluities that gather in various parts of the body, but most often in the legs, especially in those who travel, work, and carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you should administer purges of the body of black bile several times with a strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.
However, the cure of them with iron is in two ways: one is that the vein is incised and the black blood is drawn out, and the other way is that the vein is elevated and the entire blood is extracted.
The incision is done this way: first, soak the leg in very hot water until the thick, festering blood in the leg is dissolved, then firmly bind the patient's leg from just above the knee to below the groin with a bandage.  Then, cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.  Next, elevate the black blood with your hand, moving from below the leg upwards, and then downwards again, until the desired amount of blood has been drawn and the patient's ailment is mitigated.
And then bandage it, and tell him to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are filled again, and this is noted by the patient.
But the elevation of them is done this way: you raise the patient's leg, if it is very swollen, and then put it in a bath and soak the leg in hot water until it turns red and the veins are prominent; or, if a bath is unavailable, you apply vigorous exercise until the limb is warmed.
And then, cut the vein in line with the vein, either lengthwise or behind the groin, or as low as the heel.
And then, open the vein with a lancet and scrape the vein from all sides until it feels thinner, and it should show a red color that is turning dark.
And then, as it empties, you see the vein's white cord.
And then you place a poultice below it until it is elevated and pulled out of the vein, and suspend it with a hooked instrument.
And then make another incision near that incision every three days, and scrape the vein from the upper part until it appears.
And then elevate it and cut it again behind the heel, and then pull it out and elevate it until it comes out through the second incision, and then pull it out from the incision above it.
And do this until you remove it from the incision that is highest or furthest from the others, until all of it is out; and then cut it.
And if you fail to extract and elevate it, then insert a needle with a strong double hook, and ligate it and pull it out, or place a poultice under it and move your hand in all directions until it is expelled. And be careful not to cut it; for if it is broken, it will be difficult for you to elevate it further and it will have caused harm to the patient through that damage.
And when all of it has been expelled, then place on the affected area wool soaked in wine and rubbed and un-rubbed oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having twists in which it is coiled, and is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary to cut through those twists and areas where it is coiled, and then suspend it with hooks until you raise it completely.
And be careful in your incision not to cut the vein and not to damage it, for it will be difficult for you to lift it; and exercise your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not sharp like the hooks, nor has a sharp tip so that it doesn't damage the vein; and it is of great flexibility, like a lion's mane, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein by its thinness; it has, in fact, a superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, like in the land of the Arabs and in the hot, arid lands of India, where little vegetation grows, and no grass or tree grows.
And it is more easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from beneath the skin, like serpents, worms, and maggots that generate between the skin and the flesh.
A sign of the onset of this [problem] is a violent inflammation in the leg, and a blister develops there; and subsequently, the vein begins to emerge from the area of that blister, appearing like a plant's root.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap a lead weight, which is the weight of a drake (or about 2 drakes), around it.  Wrap it and leave the lead weight suspended from the leg.
And as many times as there is any cause of this [problem] externally, wrap that in lead and seal it. And if it is prolonged, then you should cut off a part of it and wrap the remaining part; and do not cut it off from the root until it is completely removed, for if you cut it off from the root, it is contracted and enters the flesh, causing an abscess and eventually a bad ulcer in that area.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is completely expelled from behind it and no trace of it remains within the body.
And from this vein, some men have had it grow to a length of five palms and ten fingers, and I have been informed that one [thing] reached a length of twenty palms.
And if it is incised during treatment, then insert a reed into the opening and pierce it with a long stick along the body until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer poultices to the area for several days using medicine; and then treat it like an abscess.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot, and has many openings, and a branch comes out of each opening.
And therefore treat it as we have said in the division and with what has been said above.
Of the incision concerning worms generated beneath the skin, and it is called the bovine disease.
This illness is called in some lands "bovine disease" because it often affects cattle, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh, and travels throughout the body, moving up and down, and is felt by the patient as movement from limb to limb until it breaks through the skin and is outside.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms, serpents, and other intestinal worms and ascarids are generated in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it travels through the body and ascends to the head, and reaches the eye, then a strong fever occurs, and it enters and destroys the eye, and this happens frequently.
And therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, it is done only by following its movement and appearance as perceived, and then you should grasp what is above it and what is below it with strong binding and constriction, and then cauterize over it and extract it.
And if it is hidden in the flesh and you don't find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the location until it dies, and the greatest fear is the corruption that it causes, corrupting the area as we have said.
And if you see that creature near the head, close to the eye, then press on the brow with strong constriction, and then cauterize over it, and extract it; and it is necessary for the sick person to use methods to cleanse their body with medicines that evacuate bad, putrid humors, and guard against foods that cause putrefaction.
Of the section concerning the illness of the nafir.
This illness is called nafir in our land, and is a pain that comes upon certain limbs, and then moves from one limb to another.
And I have already seen that, as I will tell you. I was summoned to a sick woman in a village, and I examined her arm and saw a small inflammation in the vein of the arm's bend, and after an hour, I saw that inflammation moving like a worm creeping towards it, but more quickly than one might expect, like living silver moving from place to place.
And then the pain went to that place and settled in the muscle, and there it remained for an hour.
And then it moved to the other arm until it reached the other arm.
And then it returned to me that it was moving throughout her entire body, as I saw; and I was very amazed by its movement from limb to limb, and its speed. And I had previously seen such a thing with my own eyes in that way, but I have seen many instances where pain is moved from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes quite like that in the woman.
And I did not think it was anything else than that, because the woman was old, with dried-up body and exposed veins, and in this appearance, the movement of that air became apparent to the senses.
And it is necessary that this apparent return (or reversal) not appear in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you desire the cure for them, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not evident to your eyes in the way we have said.  Then you gently and lightly press on that area until the constrained air is expelled, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you cure it with body treatments that expel air, and use unpleasant-smelling pills and pills of Serapion and similar remedies.
Extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their types and the parts of the body where they are used, for their variety is such that some have large points, and small ones, and concave, and blunt, that is, solid; and others have three angles, and some have barbs; and some have feathers.
And the signs of the brain when an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone, and emerges from the skull which covers the brain, are sudden violence, fainting, dizziness, redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms and confusion of understanding and vomiting of bile, and the speech is severely impaired and the voice destroyed, and white moisture resembling dust comes from the wound site, and it appears like the flesh has been softened.
Therefore, if these signs appear, then you abstain from treatment and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is superficial.
But the signs of an arrow striking the heart, when it is near the left breast, are that it feels like it has struck a hard, not empty, object; and the arrow's movement is very similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and the extremities feel cold, and there is cold sweat, and fainting; and therefore know that death is certain without a doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck are inflamed, the patient's complexion has changed, and the patient breathes heavily and demands cool air.
And if the arrow strikes the membrane (lining) which is in the foot, the pain is then near the small ribs, a great tremor is produced with intense pain and sighing, and all the muscles of the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then from the wound comes quickly some indigested food.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and lodges within, there appears some fissure in the wound, or the tissue, or the intestine is ruptured, and there is no hope for healing without removing the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine leaks out, and some cause of pain is spreading outward, and severe pain quickly comes upon the patient, then know that it is fatal.
However, the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, the chest, the spinal column, the collarbone, the thigh, the leg, and similar limbs, are safe according to their major conditions if the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I tell you this, what I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you might consider it in your treatment.
Which is why, in a man, an arrow struck the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose, and I extracted it from the other side, below the level of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the area of his eye, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already embedded, and only a small tip of it was found, which adhered to its shaft.  It was a large, sharp arrow of the type used by the Turks, with a lion's head shaped tip, and had no feathers.
And the Jew was healed, and no bad outcome resulted from the injury to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man, which had lodged in his throat.  It was an Arab arrow, the kind with feathers; and it had already sunk into his throat. I carefully worked around it, and then pulled it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had lodged in his stomach, and I thought he would die from it.  However, after 30 days had passed and there was no change in his condition, I cut open the arrow and carefully worked around it, and he was healed and no further harm came to him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his back, and the wound healed over time.  But after approximately seven years, the arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow lodged in her stomach, and the wound healed within her.  There was no change in her condition, and the woman experienced no harm in any of her natural bodily functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his face, and the wound healed over.  The arrow remained, causing not much pain, and many similar cases.
And I extracted the arrow from the King's prince's man, which had lodged in the middle of his nose, and had already shifted slightly to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him shortly after the arrow's lodging, within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very tight; and then I probed it gently with a fine probe, and felt nothing; but he felt a prickling beneath his right ear, and then I suspected that this prickling was due to the arrow's tip.
And I applied a plaster to the area, one with attractive and digestive virtues, confident that the area would suppurate so that the arrow's location would become evident, so that it would dry out there.
And there was no significant injury at the site that the arrow had reached it; and I continued with the plaster on it for many days, and no further accident occurred; and the wound healed meanwhile, and the patient recovered from the extraction over many days until one day he felt the arrow within his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened, and with the probe I examined it, and found the thin arrowhead, which stuck to the shaft.
And then I adjusted the treatment of the wound with that strong medicine until the arrowhead appeared visibly to me, and this process took me approximately four months.
And then, since the wound had become inflamed, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and it held firm, and didn't yield, I didn't cease to investigate and devise methods until one day I started removing it with skillfully crafted forceps, according to the description of their construction at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it; and then I healed the wound.
And some physicians thought that the nasal cartilage would not be restored, but I restored it, and the wound healed completely, and the patient was completely healthy and suffered no further harm.
And I recount to you the method of extracting certain arrows, so that you may observe this rule and significance in what I have not yet said, for the parts of this art and the definitions of it are not encompassed by the narration or contained within the book.
And skilled craftsmen compare little with much; and what is present with what is absent; and they discover novel operations and instruments for the removal of foreign bodies in the art when they occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not driven out of the limbs into which they are shot except in two ways: either by pulling from the place into which they entered; or by the contrary motion from the other side.
And that which is driven out from the place where it entered, or is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, is pulled and driven out.
And if you do not follow this method at the time of the injury, then you should leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh has healed, and the pulling and expulsion of the arrow are eased.
And similarly, if it is lodged in bone and you do not follow this method, then leave it for a few days and repeat the pulling and movement each day, and it will eventually be driven out.
And if you do not follow this method for a few days, then you should pierce around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine drill until the arrow's position is widened, and then pull it out.
But if the arrow is hidden in a body part, and is hidden from sight, then you should search for it with a probe; and if you feel it, then pull it out with tools suitable for extraction.
And if you cannot do it because of the tightness of the wound and the depth of the penetration, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein involved, then you should work on the wound until it is enlarged and the arrow can be extracted.
And if it is in the ears, where it is lodged, then carefully release the flesh in which it is stuck from every side using all the skill you can; and try to remove it, if you cannot dislodge the flesh by breaking or twisting the ears until it gives way.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow in any location, use twisting motions with your hand and forceps on all sides until you make it give way; and with subtle care, ensure the arrow does not break, and make the extraction and removal of it as easy as possible.
And if you cannot manage it right away, then leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues can heal, and then try again when it is more manageable. But if it causes excessive bleeding, then apply the treatments we described in the relevant chapter.
And use your skill in cutting veins or nerves, or tendons, and employ every possible means for the removal of the arrow; do this with ease, calmness, and slowness, and firmness, as I have explained and recommended to you.
And therefore, position the arrow in the opposite direction to how it entered the wound, because this is more beneficial. But if that is not possible, then apply whatever is possible to the situation.
However, if the arrowheads are protruding on the opposite side, or if any part of the arrow is projecting outward, or if the arrowhead has curved out from the wound's edge, then you should cut above that; and the incision should match the forceps' grip; then pull it out, because it is now easy to remove.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrowhead bites into the bone, and expands itself, and then remove it.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is inside, then you push it out with it.
But if the shaft is lodged and you want to administer an impulse, then you insert it, if it is blunt, with a concave instrument so that the concavity of it enters the arrow's shaft, and then push it out with it.
But if the arrow is concave, then you push it out with a strong instrument that enters it, for the arrow is relieved by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you cauterize all the flesh in which the wound is, if this is possible for you, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow strikes the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and is close enough for you to touch it with the probe, and it is possible to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it, and then treat the wound if needed, and heal it until it is healed.
Form of forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Let their extremities be like the beak of a bird, made like a saw, when they grasp the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of those [forceps] many varieties are made, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the patient's constriction.
So that it is eased/smoothed, like a guide, so the insertion of it into the concave arrow is aided/assisted and it is propelled by that.
Of phlebotomy (or bloodletting) of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which there are a customarily prescribed 30,  from those that are in Chapter 16, are: two pulsating veins near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins in the two apparent temples; and two veins in the two tear ducts (or, two eye areas), called *aspicientz*; the vein located in the middle of the forehead; the vein at the tip of the nose; two veins at the neck; two veins on the upper lip; two veins on the lower lip; these are called *algelic*; and two veins beneath the tongue. But the veins bled in the arms are five.  One is the cephalic vein, which is located on the outside of the arm; the people call it "the head vein," it is smooth, and a mixed vein, composed of a branch of the basilic and another branch of the cephalic.  The people call that vein "the vein of the whole body." The basilic vein, located on the inside of the arm, is called "citillar", and the common people call it "the belly vein".  The forearm vein, located on the front of the forearm, is where bloodletting is done; this is the one that appears on the surface, clearly visible.  The *salvatella*, which is the vein between the said (index) finger and the little finger, (also) on the two (forearm) bends.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one is located below the bend of the knee on the outside of the leg; the second is *sophena*, and its location is below the leg on the inside; and the sciatic vein, which is located below the leg on the outside; and in the leg there are other veins similar to these.
The bloodletting of veins near the ears is for headaches, migraines, "sahafati" (likely a disease or symptom), and old head ulcers.
And the method of bleeding those veins, as I recommend to you, is that you should first lower the patient's head and gently rub the patient's head at the back of the head, in the area of both the veins, with a wide cloth, with good friction.  Then, firmly bind the patient's neck with a bandage until the two, their locations near the ears, appear in two depressed areas of the head.  Then, touch these with your finger, and if you feel the pulse in those with your finger, there you should apply the lancet.
Then take the lancet, which is sharp, and then insert it under the vein into the skin until the bloodletting reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with a sharp incision. And the length of the incision should be about the width of two fingers; let the blood flow out as much as desired.
And then press with a poultice and leave it until it is healed.
And already in the beginning of the book, the incision of these things and their cauterization have been discussed.
But of the two arterial veins that are in the temples, the relief from phlebotomy is for ancient migraines and persistent evil eye and incessant eye diseases and the flow of acute excess fluids poured into the eyes.
And the method of performing phlebotomy on those veins is as I have told you: restrain the patient's neck until the two veins become visible to the eye and the pulse of them under your finger is demonstrably present; then you lance them with a lancet.
And then you elevate the skin over the vein on either side with your index finger, and insert the lancet slightly below, and raise the vein up; and cut it in the same way as you did with the other two veins; and allow the blood to flow according to your need.
And then release the patient's restraint, and place your finger over the vein for an hour, and then apply a poultice and powders, and compress it strongly, and leave it until it is healed.
And the recollection of them, and their incision and extraction, is already described at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is suitable for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in cases of old ailments of the face, migraines, stiffness, and foul-smelling ulcers.
And the procedure for phlebotomy is as I recommend to you; that is, the patient should bind their neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument called a "fossor" (or digger), of which this is the shape:
Place the pointed end of the lancet on that vein and pierce it with a gentle or other suitable tool, and allow the blood to flow according to the desired amount; and then release the patient's restraint and compress the area until healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however, the phlebotomy should not be made with a sharp end like the other phlebotomies, but with a blunt end, and pierce it across; because the bone is near and strong and the lancet would break there if the phlebotomy were made too thin.
But the benefit of the two veins located near the lacrimals is for scabies of the eyes, stiffness and swelling in the eyes, and ailments of the face.
The procedure for phlebotomy is that the patient should bind their neck with a bandage, and then perform the phlebotomy, and you should be standing over their head.
And the phlebotomy should be made across the length, with a gentle phlebotomy, for there is no muscle in that location; and if the phlebotomy is too thin, the tip will easily break.
Then allow the blood to flow as much as you need, and place a cloth over it, and bind it for a night, and then release it.
But phlebotomy of the nasal vein is appropriate for acute fever and violent headaches, and for facial ailments, migraines, and swelling that occur on the face, especially when it is chronic.
The procedure for this phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their neck, and you should hold their nose with your left hand, and take a thin lancet, and insert it into the center of the nasal bridge along the straight line, as the vein is not apparent to the touch there, and the blood will begin to flow immediately.
You should gently use the small lancet to allow the blood to flow according to your needs; and then bind it for a night, as it will heal quickly.
However, phlebotomy of both sides can be beneficial for constricted breathing, the beginning stages of leprosy, many illnesses, and skin diseases such as sores, or shingles.
And the procedure for phlebotomy on both sides is that the patient should hold their neck with a bandage below each one; and the surgeon should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a chair.
Then, carefully lance the vein along its length with a wide lancet, little by little; and remove blood in a moderate quantity, or as much as needed; and then do the same to the other vein.
Then loosen the bandage and compress the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning, for the wound is healing.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the veins, alleviates small abscesses and pustules in the mouth, decay of the gums, sores and cracks, and sores on the nose and surrounding areas.
And the procedure for phlebotomy on those veins is to have the patient sit before you, and bind their neck with a bandage, then pull open their lips and look for two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the second on the left; and you can identify each one by the blackness of each one of them, because there are also many small black veins in the surrounding area; and then you should cut each one with a lancing incision.
But if there is doubt, and you do not know which vein to cut, then you should cut the largest, and most prominent one of those veins.
And do the same for the two veins that are on the upper lips.
However, for two veins under the tongue, phlebotomy is helpful for conditions like the throat, problems with the uvula, and ailments of the mouth.
And the technique for phlebotomizing those veins is to have the patient lie between your hands, facing the sun, and lift their tongue, and look under the tongue; one vein on one side and one on the other, and the color of each is leaning towards black.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to injure your hand in phlebotomizing them, for under those are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are common to all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either using a leech-shaped phlebotomy instrument with a gradually tapering tip; or using a knife for phlebotomy, which is called incision, and this is its method:
The cuts should be made in such a way, and it is necessary to open the concave, full, apparently large veins, and those that contain thick, troubled blood.
And this phlebotomy is of smaller width and a more subtle extremity, and it is suitable for phlebotomy of thin veins containing thin, citrus-like blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it removes blood from illnesses affecting the throat, neck, and from conditions affecting the feet and abdomen.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, to be very careful and cautious, for there is an artery below it. If they err and misplace the phlebotomy puncture, they will cut that artery and cause a flood of blood. Therefore, it is necessary not to phlebotomize it with a pointed instrument, but rather to make a cutting incision with a scalpel.
And if the basilic vein is not readily visible, then it is necessary to leave it and move to another vein, or to search for a branch of it; or to perform phlebotomy on the forearm, for that is easily visible; and to cut it with a scalpel phlebotomy as we have said.
But if you wish to perform phlebotomy on that same vein, then it is necessary, before the bend of the arm, to touch the area until you locate the pulse, and then press on it with your finger; and then bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision using a scalpel, as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not stray too far from the artery's location.
And when, while tightening the bandage, you notice swelling at the spot you marked with your finger, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that spot.
And if you see the blood flowing during the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and watery, then know that it is from the artery; and then you should press and put your finger over the spot for a while; and then remove your finger, and if the blood is severed—for often it is severed—then you should tighten the arm and leave that spot alone.
And watch the patient carefully, and be concerned about them and do not let them move around for a few days until they are healed.
But if the blood is not severed, and you perceive that you lack the appropriate medicine for this, then you should cut the artery, if it appears suitable to you; for its extremity is constricted, and the blood is severed; or take some fig bark, and make a powder of it, and take half of it and press it onto the vein's location with a tight bandage and poultices until the next day.
And if the blood is severed, it is good; but if not, then treat it with what was previously mentioned in the section about stopping the flow of blood from severed veins.
And the severing of the blood from them is difficult in many positions due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of bandaging the arm.
However, from the superficial vein, phlebotomy is beneficial when drawing blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it is important for the phlebotomist to be cautious in their phlebotomy, for beneath that is a nerve; and if, in the process of puncturing, the phlebotomist encounters the nerve, it will cause numbness, and healing will be difficult, and often the area will not fully recover. This nerve is frequently perceptible; and if it is hidden from some people, and is delicate and not easily seen, then you should guide your phlebotomy with a lancet, avoiding the nerve with careful strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy on the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and is useful for illnesses of the eyes.
And in this particular case, if you want to perform phlebotomy, use an olive-pointed or myrtle-pointed lancet, for it is the safest of all the veins, as there is neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, a boil is often located in some people, when it has not been opened by the first incision, and that boil is not injured in any way.
The first thing to understand is that phlebotomy is performed only for the preservation of health and in the hope of preventing illness.  It should be done on one of the veins of the elbow, namely the cephalic, basilic, or median cubital veins.  Phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, after fasting, and in spring and autumn, and in winter just before meals, whenever signs of congestion appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the third day, or at least three hours after the procedure.
But phlebotomy, when indicated by necessity and appropriateness, may be performed at any time, night or day.
A child should not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be bled until the fourth to seventh month.  Elderly people who are over sixty years old should not be bled.
And if someone wishes to be bled, regardless of the reason, they should cleanse their bowels beforehand with a lion's-bile enema, if they have a lot of retained waste, so that the veins do not draw the impurities from the bowels into the blood during the phlebotomy, and that these impurities do not harm the vital organs.
Patients suffering from severe nausea, vomiting, or drunkenness, those recovering from illness or fever, or those with dropsy should not be bled until these conditions are resolved.  Furthermore, phlebotomy should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, bowel issues, excessive sexual activity, strenuous work or exercise, fasting, or vigils, and any other cause that weakens the body's or spirit's strength.
And beforehand, consider the excess of humors.  If the blood is thick, use food and drink, and if possible, medicines, to thin it.
And if no other reason forbids it, take a bath, or engage in some exercise, so that the blood may be thinned.
Perform the phlebotomy on the patient in the early part of the day, around the third hour, as we have said.
Ensure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful emotional influences, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily stressors, like excessive exertion, pain, sexual activity, and similar things.
And have present at his bedside whatever causes are customarily used by men with aromatic fragrances and scents, and balsams, and similar things, according to what is possible.
And place the phlebotomist on a cushion higher than the cushion of the person who is to be bled.
Then the phlebotomist should remove their arm, and rub the arm with their hand two or three times; then tighten the bandage with a strap and wrap it around twice.
Let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is too tight, or if the constriction is excessive, then prohibit the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then prohibit the flow of blood also.
And now, with the constriction, the person to be bled should rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly visible.
And then the phlebotomist anoints their lancet with a little old-fashioned oil; then places their left index finger on the vein, below the spot where they want to make the incision, so that the vein moves slightly, and the probing is halted; for of the veins, this one is the one you find similar to a fleeing string heading toward the incision, and from these, this one is full of air and, when you place the lancet on it, is drawn toward the incision, and the phlebotomist is warned; and the lancet does not open the vein, and if it does, it is constricted.
Therefore, for this reason, the phlebotomist must be careful and attentive to all these things.
And then, he places the lancet again, but if the vein opens in one try, that's good; and otherwise, you repeat this another time below that spot a little bit, or above it quickly, if the area isn't inflamed.
And if the area is inflamed, or the patient is afraid, then you leave it for a day or two, and do not bind the limb tightly, for that would draw out a painful abscess, nor should they bathe.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if needed.
And if the opening is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will come out, then you repeat the phlebotomy at the same spot, adjusting the opening a little bit, and do this quickly before the area becomes inflamed, because many men's areas become inflamed from small openings.
But if the area is already inflamed, then do not repeat it there, for it will not serve any purpose; and put a little oil on that area of the wound, for it will ease the flow of blood. And it is better in this case than other oils.
And similarly, apply a bandage of oil in all phlebotomies, with which you drain the veins to prevent blood from flowing, and they do this with turpentine, aloe, and saffron when applied to the area, because blood is refined and lessened when thickened.
And if a large abscess is formed at the site of the phlebotomy, which often happens, especially in those who have not been bled before, or in those with a small vein opening, then you should cauterize, and apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the area, and press it for an hour, because it will dissolve [the abscess].
And it is necessary to do this near the point of blood release from that vein, with the help of it or another vein.
And if some blackening or greenness remains in the area for several days, do not be concerned; and if you wish, apply a mixture of aloes and myrrh dissolved, or some mint or balm extract, or something similar.
And frequently abscesses and swellings occur after phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And therefore, place your hand over it, and if you find softness under your pressure, then that swelling is bad and dangerous; and then be careful not to apply anything mentioned previously, because blood will easily flow from the artery.
Apply a poultice with something astringent to harden the area, and subsequently treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
It is necessary to draw blood from each person according to their constitution and the color of the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it becomes red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it becomes thinner; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is reduced.
And it is necessary for someone who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one session, that the incision of the vein be enlarged and the incision be wide.
And for someone who is frail, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw blood from them in several sessions, and the incision should be narrow.
And the best practice in venesection is a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of venesection avoids blood flow and nerve damage, and is more praiseworthy and safer than venesection along the length or width.
And in whom fainting is accustomed to occur upon venesection, you must treat that beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in mulled wine or simple warm vinegar; and draw a little blood in three or four sessions.
And if it is a coldness of constitution, then before the venesection, let them consume bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey syrup spiced with pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar spices, or a strongly aromatic syrup.
And if fainting occurs during venesection, and the cause is the loss of a lot of blood, then it is necessary that they drink broth and a very fragrant, delicate syrup; and use aromatics with camphor, and soothe their feet with it.
And use the other remedies we have mentioned in the section on fainting due to evacuation.
And whoever wishes to thin their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, it is necessary for someone for whom venesection is a major evacuation, and whose virtue is slow, to evacuate the blood little by little, according to the quantity of the virtue over the continuing days.
But whoever wishes to thin their arm, and let their blood out a second time, and their body is strong, then do this approximately seven or nine hours after the first venesection.
But whoever wishes to draw the blood of their body to the opposite part to which it is inclining, it is necessary that it be thinned on the second or third day.
However, in a body where there is much heated and thickened blood that causes fever, it is necessary to let out a large quantity of blood in one go, and to increase the opening until fainting occurs, provided you have observed all the conditions of venesection; and you should place your hand on the patient's pulse near the body of the blood, to prevent death instead of fainting, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and careless.
And it is not appropriate when you wish to thin the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, once the opening of the vein is closed and the blood flow is difficult, that you press on it with force and the arm is extended slightly, for that is very bad.
Allow it to remain until it is bled a second time; or remove this by the sharpness of the phlebotomy, which has clotted blood in the vein's opening; or apply theriac, or a salve, to it, and compress it gently until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation is calmed.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed from that spot or from another vein in the other arm.
And the vein called the "cord of the arm" is opened where the cephalic or basilic veins are, if they are not found or hidden, for it is composed of those.
And the quality of the bloodletting is that the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the vein reddens and becomes clearly visible.
And then tie it tightly with a moderate constriction; and then open the vein along the small transverse line, not lengthwise nor laterally.
And make the opening wide, and your bloodletting, with which you open that one, a little above the wrist joint.
And if the flow of blood is prohibited, then you re-immerse the hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your desired outcome.
But if you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from re-immersion of the hand in warm water, and in winter the body's bloodletting is done in warm water.
And bloodletting from this vein is safer than from all other veins, for beneath it there is no pulsating vein, nor nerve.
And bloodletting from the vein in the right wrist is effective against ailments of the liver.
And the technique for bloodletting from this vein is that you hold the arm with a bandage or your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly visible; then, make the incision across this vein; and if you cut it completely, it will do no harm.
And be careful not to cut too deep with your lancet, for below it are the nerves of the fingers, bare of flesh.
And then return the arm to the warm water and allow the blood to flow from it, for if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and it will be prevented from flowing.
And when the blood has been extracted to the desired amount, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not clot quickly; and similarly, you should do this for every vein you cut.
However, the benefit of bloodletting from the left arm is that it is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen.
And do likewise in the bloodletting of him as you did in the other. (or, and do the same bloodletting on him as you did on the other.)
And the benefit of bloodletting from the saphenous vein is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine problems, and retention of menses, and for ailments of the kidneys and ulcers of the thighs and legs that have been present for a long time, and similar illnesses.
And the procedure for bloodletting him is that the patient should put his foot in warm water and rub it until the veins appear clearly; and tie the joint of the foot with a bandage; and the place of the vein, which appears clearly near the said point, from there branches into many small veins on the surface of the foot.
And therefore, make the incision on the widest vein, either below the leg towards the heel, or near its junction, because it is better and more effective.
And if you make the incision on the surface of the foot, then be mindful of the nerves that lie beneath the surface of the foot, and perform your bloodletting across the vein, as if you were trying to cut it in half/in two.
And let the bloodletting be done carefully.
But if the removal of blood is prohibited, then you should repeatedly immerse the patient's foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow out until it has been evacuated.
And if the bloodletter errs on the first attempt, then repeat the bloodletting a little further in, because the area is effective/suitable; and do not fear harming the patient, but rather be careful of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly, do the same for the corresponding area on the other foot as well.
And for the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, beneath the bone of the outside/lateral part.
And the remedy for the bloodletting of this, is for hip pain when it's due to hot blood.
And the procedure for the bloodletting is that the patient enters a bath, and swiftly and tightly wraps their thigh from the groin area up to above the heel with a long, thin bandage for four days, because it appears only from this.
And then, when it appears, you should perform the bloodletting according to whatever method is possible for you and the position of the vein, and this is better; either cut it with incision or with a section, for the area is salty/affected.
And it is very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch, then bleed a branch of it, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot next to the so-called auricular and annular (or ring-shaped) regions.
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow in the quantity you desire.
And then loosen the constriction and place a compress over the bloodletting site and bind the area tightly, for it will heal quickly.
Of cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping is done with horns, or with leather, or with glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with incision and extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping without incision is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And for cupping that is administered with incision and blood extraction, there are fourteen places on the body, of which one place where cupping is placed is at the nape of the neck, and it is the rear part of the head; and in the middle is the space between the two sides of the neck together; and cupping of the chin under the jaw, then below the mouth; and cupping on both shoulder blades; and cupping on the shoulder blades, and it is at the end of the shoulder blade; and cupping on the two elbows, and on both arms; and cupping on the two knees; and cupping on the two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood from the large veins, but from the small, scattered veins in the flesh, and therefore it does not diminish the vital force as occurs with bloodletting; nor should cupping with or without fire be performed for any illness caused by fullness until the entire body is evacuated.
However, if need compels cupping for an illness or for a continuous ailment, administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month and at the end, in the middle of it, and at any time.
Therefore, when any of these conditions occur, and particularly if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we command that cupping be performed after two or three hours have passed.
The benefit of cupping the neck is that it alleviates heaviness in the head and what is pressing on the eyes; however, this should be followed by the evacuation of the entire body.
And this cupping is in the location of the cephalic vein's bloodletting.
And it is not permitted for someone with a cold or one with a catarrh to use it, for it causes them great harm.
Therefore, it is not suitable for the elderly to use it, and those whose heads are afflicted with cold illnesses.
However, for the person who is continually being treated with it, it is made ineffective; therefore, you should instruct the cupper to slightly reposition the cup downwards in the affected areas, fearing the creation of ineffectiveness.
But cupping with alcohol is in the location of bloodletting from the vena fusca and the basilica veins: and therefore, it is applied to asthma, and constriction of the breath and the tearing of the windpipe, and to coughs, and congestion.
And the alcohol cupping should be raised slightly, for if it is placed too low, it will generate weakness in the body and the stomach.
And cupping with *alhagdahan* is used for accidental pains in the head, and for ophthalmia, migraine, and feverishness, and for pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is a substitute for bloodletting from the basilica vein.
And you should instruct the cupper not to press with too much force using a scalpel, so that he does not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin is beneficial for sores in the mouth, and for gum rot, and similar mouth ailments, and it is a substitute for bloodletting of the veins that are in both lips.
But cupping between the two shoulder blades is beneficial for a condition called *caphutan*, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on both sides inside the hollows [of the armpits] is a helpful substitute for bloodletting from three veins, namely the basilica, the cephalic, and the brachial, because it draws blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh and those smaller veins draw blood from the larger ones until the drawing is done to the three main veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed too deeply with the incision, because the area is lacking in flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
And a cupping treatment applied to the buttocks is beneficial for hemorrhoids and ulcers in the lower rectum.
And you should tell the cupper to use a large, leather cupping glass, because the area needs a strong suction;  thin, easily pierced cupping glasses are ineffective and should be avoided, along with superficial incisions.
However, cupping on the legs is less effective, because it draws blood from the entire body, and it is helpful for chronic pains in the kidneys, liver, and bladder; it stimulates menstruation, and is helpful for fever and exhaustion; it stands in place of bloodletting from two jugular veins, and in place of drawing with two leaches.
However, it weakens the entire body and can cause fainting in many people.
And the benefit from cupping is comparable to the benefit of cupping both legs.
And the method for applying the cupping is to place the empty cupping glass initially and gently draw a moderate suction.  Do not prolong the application of the cupping glasses, but instead place them lightly and remove them quickly, so that the humors move to the area. And do not stop repeating this and continuing until you see the area reddened and swollen and the blood vessels appear.
And then you make incisions and repeat the suction gradually, and then consider the condition of the patient's body.
For a person with delicate, sensitive skin, you should make a single incision, and no more, to avoid ulceration of the area.
And instruct the cupper to enlarge the incision slightly, and to regulate the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then you should make two incisions, for in the first one, the path for the blood and its watery component is opened. But in the second, the examination gains the extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very impure, then a third incision should be made to achieve the final result.
And finally, when we want to extract a little blood gradually, a single incision is sufficient.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make many incisions; and if we know the blood is thick, then we need to make deep incisions.
And the term for incision where the depth is only the length of the gouge.
And if the affected area has a thick, hard, dark complexion, and its pores are tight, the places for the cupping glasses should be rubbed with softening, opening, and dissolving remedies; if it's summer, use oil of almonds, or oil of violets, or oil of mild myrrh, or oil of quince seed; and if it's winter, use narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or bloodroot oil, and similar ones.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then use oil of marjoram, or oil of balm, or oil of almond, or dill oil, and similar ones.
But if the patient has wide pores and tender flesh, then oil should be avoided, and the areas around the cupping glasses should be washed with cool water, or water from the plant Solanum, or quince water, or water from the plant Borrago, and similar liquids.
And for those whose blood is moist and watery, wash their cupping glasses with sour wine, or with water of myrtle and sumac, and similar things.
And for those whose superfluities are thick, wash their cupping glasses with old wine, or with water of plantain (likely a reference to a specific type of plantain, not the common one), or with an infusion of dill, or chamomile, and similar remedies.
And the cupping should be avoided before a bath; if taken, it should be administered shortly before the bath, for an hour or two, and the patient should rest after the cupping.
What is that which ought to be regulated for the cupping or bloodletting before the cupping?
One should consider at the outset: if the person being cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp, inflammatory blood, then it is necessary for them to take things that cool the blood, such as pickled mulberries, endive in sour wine, lettuce, and drying substances like cumin, julep, and similar remedies.
And restrict their food to things like herbs, tender fowl meat, and dishes seasoned with sour ingredients, and similar foods.
And for someone with a cold constitution, they should drink licorice syrup, or syrup made from cannabis seeds, sumac, and very fragrant wine (somewhere between old and new); they should be advised to consume little food and drink, and their diet should include herbs, hemp, small birds, and pigeons.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, the amount of drink should be greater than the amount of food.
And it is necessary to give certain people, at certain times, theriac alpharac, or musk-based remedies (i.e., musk, or ambergris) before cupping or bloodletting, or shortly thereafter, so that the principal members of the body are strengthened and the blood is refined; and they should not take these remedies when heated.
However, cupping without scarification should be applied to the liver, spleen, gout, navel, knee areas, and the lower back, since these areas cannot tolerate scarification.
And this is not sought for anything other than the drawing of blood from a limb, just as we place a cupping glass on the nipple in cases of nosebleeds; and we use it to dissolve cold, stagnant air from the limb, just as we place it on the abdomen and navel; because it thins the limb, warms it, and relieves the pain by resolving the stagnant air.
And it is already placed on the kidneys when they are congested or have a blockage, for by the virtue of strong suction, it quickly relieves congestion and removes the blockage from its location.
Similarly, it works when placed on the liver and spleen to remove the stagnant air contained within them.
And these cupping glasses are administered empty, with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in diseases of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and larger, either with just warm water, or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
The form of a cupping glass administered with fire:  the opening should be about two fingers wide, as we have formed it; and the quantity of the heat should be about half a palm; and it should be on the patient's back, in the area of the back that is halfway around, the opening should be small enough that only a needle could fit through it.
It should be made of red or citrus wood, with thick, strong, and smooth edges so that it does not damage the body part it is placed upon.
And in the middle of it there should be a transverse rod of wood or iron, upon which a candle is placed with the fire.
And this cupping glass should be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one should be smaller, depending on the illness and the age of the user.
The cupping glasses for children and the weakened are different from those for young people and those with strong bodies.
And the quality of applying this cupping glass with fire to the body part is to extend the fire with firewood properly before a small beeswax candle, and place that on the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is ignited around the area underneath, so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's body part, and the finger should be on the hole we mentioned, until, when we have the cupping glasses and we don't want the finger to be exposed and the vapor to escape through that hole, then the cupping glass will quickly be dissolved.
And ignite the fire according to its manner, and repeat it if you need it.
But a cupping glass administered for a disease of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod or hole, and it is not administered except that it be filled with water, and is placed on the body part only.
And this is its form: And the larger this cupping glass is, the better, so that it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs where cupping is not possible, due to their small size, like the foot, and the gums, and similar parts; or to limbs devoid of flesh, like the finger and nose and similar parts.
And the quality of using those leeches that you have found in clean, clear, muddy waters.
And afterwards, they [the leeches] should be left in clean, fresh water overnight until they are hungry, and no remnants remain in their stomachs; and subsequently, the body should be evacuated at the beginning with bloodletting and cupping; and then the patient's limb should be rubbed until it reddens; and then the leeches should be placed on it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if suction from the area is possible using a cupping vessel, it is better afterwards in terms of treatment.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water; and rub and squeeze it.
And if the body of blood is prolonged around the placement of the leeches, and it is oozing, then you should dip a cloth in cold water and place it over the area until the oozing is stopped.
And if the blood is excessive, then sprinkle powdered vitriol or other similar astringent substances upon it until the blood is stopped; or place roasted chickpea halves over the area, and leave them until the chickpeas adhere to the spot, and the blood is stopped.
And if necessary, repeat the use of leeches, when it's possible to change them.
And if the leeches are prohibited from being used, then rub the area with fresh blood or pierce it with a needle until blood comes out; and then apply them, because these leeches, when they sense any blood, immediately adhere.
And when you want them to release, sprinkle a little crushed aloes, or salt, or ash on them, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the treatment of the third part: of restoration. This chapter is very necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations that accidentally occur in the bones.
O, son, know that foolish and vulgar physicians, and those who have never looked into the books of the ancients or read a single letter from them, boast about this chapter.
And for this reason, this method of the learned ones in our land is private; and I have not forgotten this at all; and I have not embraced this, but only through a long study of the books of the ancients and study of their meaning, until I extracted their science.
And from now on I dedicate myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter everything that my knowledge contains and upon which my experience has been tested; since I have shortened this for you, and freed it from lengthy explanations; and condensed it at the end of the condensation; and shown it at the end of the explanation; and formed many forms of the instruments used in this, as was done by adding explanations, as I have done in the two previous chapters.
First Chapter.
A summary and collection of the essential elements for understanding bone fractures, before we begin to discuss the treatment of broken limbs and their diverse types. Therefore, let us begin this chapter with a summary of the subject; and the topics, understanding which is essential for practitioners at the outset and for upholding the truth of those things; that is to say, you and those who are eager to learn this noble art, whether they are your students or others.
And therefore I say that when an accident of fracture, dislocation, twisting, or crushing occurs, then it is necessary to begin with phlebotomy or to alleviate the situation, or both together, unless some reason prevents you, such as weakness, or the person is a child, or old and frail, or it is a time of intense heat or intense cold.
And afterwards, let their diet consist of fresh herbs and the flesh of birds and rabbits; and forbid them fatty meats and foods that fill them up, and any food that overfills the veins with blood, until you are sure of a suppurating boil, and if you do not fear a discharge of matter onto the limb.
And then, return the patient to their original regimen, the one they were accustomed to.
And therefore, once the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient must eat nutritious foods, substantial, thick and heavy foods with viscosity, such as cooked wheat with water, rice, broth, calves' feet, eggs, fresh fish, and thick wines similar to these; and with this regimen, the fracture heals more easily and better.
And know that broken bones in the elderly and the frail, in their initial injury, cannot be made whole and properly consolidated because of the wasting away of their limbs.
However, nature joins and brings together around the broken bone from all sides a substance similar to glue, thick and adhering, that binds it tightly until it is completely joined and united, until it reaches the point of strength and firmness, just as a fire does at the start, until any factor prevents it from continuing its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary to provide the patient with foods that are heavy, viscous, and thick, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures vary according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the arm bone; and similarly, all the other limbs have different types of fractures.
And I come with a reminder of every kind of fracture, explained in its own separate chapter.
There is a diversity of fractures within themselves. And the types of bone fractures themselves are diverse; for there is a curved fracture, and others that occur in star-like patterns; and sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone:  and these are the fractures called transverse, oblique, and compound/complicated [referring to open fractures], just as is the case with a pen when it is being prepared to write.  And there are fractures with a gap/separation and a crack/disruption to the head, and there are small fissure fractures.
And for every type, there is a specific treatment or remedy in restoring it, according to the specific reminder of it in its respective places.
A sign of a bone fracture. And by this a bone fracture is recognized: it is a twisting of the bone, and a prominence and appearance of it to the sense, and this is of it when you grasp it with your hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the bone, nor is it painful upon your touch when you press the bone with pressure, and the patient does not experience great pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there might be a twisting or a small fissure, then you should not waste time with your hand and a whole compressive force.  Instead, apply appropriate medicines to that spot, as remembered at that time that suits the location, and then tightly bandage it with a fine bandage.
And know that when the fractured spot is curved, but not completely broken in two or otherwise damaged in the structure, with the whole part of its composure remaining, then you must, from this point forward, begin to correct it, lest an inflamed boil occur there.
And if a painful boil forms there, then leave it for a few days until the boil subsides; and then bandage it according to any method you can, with gentleness and skill.
And know that the restoration and healing of a curved bone is easier than when it's broken/fractured in a more severe manner.
And then strengthen it according to the instructions that follow.
But if the bone is fractured, then an extension of the broken limb (whether hand or foot) is necessary; use your hand if the limb is small, or two ropes, or one rope and your hand.
And maintain the position in which you place the limb in a bandage according to its natural shape, while the fractured limb parts are extended, then you must carefully return those additions to their places with skill and in any way possible.
And be careful, with your strength, that your treatment does not cause pain or injury to the patient; and strive to fit one bone to its companion according to their best forms, to the best of your ability.
And it is fitting that at that time you carefully touch it with your hand, and if there is any different cause, correct it and make it whole with your skill.
Avoid excessive extension and compression, as some foolish doctors often cause a painful abscess by their treatment, or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen happen many times with their treatment.
The quality of the stricture applied to the still limb is what I am recommending; so that you know that broken limbs vary in their smallness and largeness and in the form of those limbs.
And for those that are small, such as the arm, finger, and similar parts, the wrapping should be of fine, soft cloth.
However, for those that are large, such as the thigh or leg, the wrapping should be firm and strong, for the firm bandage unites the large limb and binds it securely in every part, so that no foreign matter enters.
And then, proceed with your treatment, placing a suitable bandage over the fracture site, using three or four wraps, according to the limb's needs; and gently tighten the bandage with your hand.
And then, approach with that to the most prominent part of the fracture site, and tighten less than you tightened the fracture site with your previous bandage. And then, gently loosen the wrapping of the fracture site a little, and gradually release the tightness, until you have pulled the area of the fracture apart significantly.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken area, using turns, and then proceed with the wraps to the lowest part of the fracture; and your procedure should be in the tightening of the wrapping and in releasing it, as we have described in the first wrap above.
And then place, between the wraps, a piece of linen or cloth to encompass the crookedness of the fracture, if there is any; and if not, do not put anything there.
And then place another bandage over these carefully applied wraps, immediately, if there is no inflammation or harmful abscess at the site.  And if there is, place on it whatever soothes the abscess and reduces the inflammation; leave that for a few days; and then tighten the bandages over it.
Let the splints be made of half of a slender, straight piece of wood, or be fashioned from pine wood, or palm fronds; and let the width of each splint be according to this shape and this form:
However, the splint placed over the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to the size and smallness of the limb; and then tighten the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then tie it securely above with thread, as we have said about the tightening, and let your tightening be over the area of the fracture, and the further away from the fracture the less tightness.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fine, and be made of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen some fools do in their surgeries, using thick ropes or twine for threads, it is a great error, when the tightening lacks uniformity.
And similarly, very thin threads are not suitable, for you will not achieve the desired tightening with them, and there should not be less than a finger's width between each splint.
And if the patient is irritated by the edges of the splints near the tightening in those places, then place underneath those splints some soft wool or carded wool until it does not cause him/her any injury.
Sometimes a fracture occurs with a wound, and there is a disruption of the bone, and I will discuss it in detail in the second chapter of the singular cases.
And know that not every broken limb should be tightened with splints on the first day; this is because when the limb is large, you should not place splints on it until approximately five or seven days, or more, depending on your certainty of avoiding a suppurative inflammation.
And this is the method of plasters with which the ancients treated fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A method of a common plaster for fracture repair, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, because it does not produce heat or cold: take ground flour powder, which is the medulla of the flour that remains on the walls of the mill after grinding.
And make it like this, but sieve it with egg white, and spread the mixture thinly and not too subtly; and then use it.
Another method of plaster for treating fractures, dislocations, and sprains: a recipe using assafoetida, opoponax, acacia, enula, and wild chamomile root, each one ounce; myrrh and aloes, half an ounce each; aloes, two ounces; all crushed, sifted, and mixed with rosewater or egg white if the patient's complexion is sensitive; and then use this plaster, as it is well-composed and heals slightly broken bones, and is beneficial for many people.
Another method of plaster beneficial for fractures and sprains: recipe using wild chamomile and white marshmallow root, one ounce each; myrrh and aloes, half an ounce each; acacia, six ounces; and Armenian bole, two ounces.
All are crushed in a mortar with great effort, sifted, and mixed with water or egg white, and then applied.
A method of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their places, and for pain, fissures, and fractures: take a piece of absorbent wool, soak it in sour wine and boiled oil, and place it on the affected area.
However, this plaster does not have the virtue of restoring, but it is good for resolving suppurative sores and expelling pain effectively.
Another method of plaster for mending a broken bone: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; crush them all together and make a plaster from them.
A quick method of plaster for aiding in the healing of a broken bone, and when you want resolution of remaining suppuration: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, and violet flowers, and ground elder; pulverize all into a powder, mix with wine if the affected limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then mix it with moist coriander water or with plain water and use it.
Another stronger plaster for resolving suppuration, better than the first, when you have a hard abscess preventing limb healing: take roots of marshmallow, seeds of flax, and bramble, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile; pulverize everything into powder, mix with willow water, or plain water, or wine, depending on the quality of the limb and the color (condition) of it.
However, Hippocrates in his book does not say to put it on a broken limb during healing, but rather a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else; and recommends it to be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
However, in Gaul, it is seen that they are applied to a broken limb during healing, and the ingredients for which there is desiccation with slight warmth, such as myrrh, frankincense, and similar to those mentioned earlier.
A plaster for injuries and pain: take equal parts of chickweed, human skin (or bird's), marshmallow root, and salt; grind and sift them, and then mix to form a plaster.
However, the length of time the bandage should remain, and when it should be removed, depends on whether there is pain, swelling, or whether the bone is broken and out of place.  If none of these occur, then do not remove the bandage for several days. And if there is severe pain, swelling, or inflammation at the site, then you should unwrap or remove it immediately, and remove the plaster.
And take a clean cloth and a damp sponge of sea sponge, and soak it in lukewarm water, and with that wash the area until the swelling subsides and the pain is relieved; then let the limb rest for an hour; and then apply a layer of wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rosemary oil, and bandage it overnight until you are sure the inflammation is down, and the pain of the limb has subsided.
Then, repeat this subtle compression and apply a small plaster, without the initial tightness, and use it until healed.
And if the abscess, stiffness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms have completely subsided, and you no longer need a plaster or compression, then repeat the process as you did at the beginning.
And if there is no cause for any of those symptoms in the limb, then do not remove it for about three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all of this is left for twenty days, as it appears to you from the treatment of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh coagulates around it.
Then, apply more compression to the bandage than you did initially, and increase the patient's diet, according to what is necessary for their recovery.
However, if you find the fracture site is already drying out and weakening more than necessary, understand that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.  Therefore, moisten it with lukewarm water every time you remove the dressing.  Do this for three days.  Loosen the bandage slightly, and through this action, nourishment returns to the limb, leading to quick healing.
But what those foolish bone setters do to a fractured limb a second time, when it wasn't properly set the first time, and it is set with crookedness, is a mistake in their practice, a great danger.  If they had done it correctly, the ancients in their books would have written about it, and they would have acted accordingly.
And I have not seen anyone of them do this, which makes it more reasonable not to do it.
Second Chapter: Of fractures when they occur to the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow of a weapon, and the blow shatters all the bone to the skull, which is underneath the bone, just as a blow does to a wooden post.  Thus, this type is called a splintered fracture; or the weapon cuts a part of the bone, and cuts into the flesh but does not cut through to the back of the bone; and this type of fracture is called a simple separation.
And the severity of these two fractures is either great or small, and a fracture that is a crushing or a grinding; and the cause is a blow with a stone or a fall on a rock, and the like.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the severity of these two fractures is either great or small.
And a fracture is one that is hidden within the bone, in the smallness of a hair, and thus this type is called a hairline fracture.
And a fracture is one made either by falling or by a blow of a stone and similar things, that causes a portion of the bone to enter into its cavity, just as happens to the ribs when struck, and a part of their entry is into the cavities within.
This is more often the case in the soft bones, like the skulls of infants.
And in all these types of fractures, the pieces are scattered like separated shards. And I will come with the remedy for all of this, restoring it to its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by examining them and by inquiring about them with probes and examining the decaying flesh that is on top of them.
A splinter fracture is recognized because it's exposed on the bone, and it is cleaned and probed, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of a fracture, consider first the patient's symptoms, and if you observe symptoms that indicate great peril, such as vomiting of bile, extensive pain, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, swelling and stiffness of the affected areas, and similar symptoms to those in serious cases, without a doubt, it will not be healed.
And if you observe symptoms that are not severe, you expect recovery, then you begin the treatment of it.
The reason for this is that if the injured person comes to you at the beginning of the injury, and this is during the winter days, then you must study the examination of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all circumstances.
And if it is in the summer days, then you must try to examine the bone before the seventh day, fearing that what is beneath the bone may be corrupted by the swelling, and that the symptoms we have mentioned may occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the swelling covering the brain, and it has small fragments and grinding, then you must incise the broken and ground part, as I will advise you.
And you must shave the head of the injured patient, and uncover the bone according to the custom and manner possible for you, according to the nature of the injury, and be gentle on the patient.
And if you encounter bone exposure, bleeding or a hot abscess, you must treat it with what is appropriate.  You should fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rubbed oil, and allow the wound to rest until the abscess subsides, and the bleeding ceases. Then begin the process of examining the bone and removing it.
And this will be according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a narrow, sharp scalpel.  This is its form: Then, you place another scalpel slightly further out than the first one.  This is its form:
And then place a scalpel further out than the second one.
And you should have several different scalpels, some wider than others, some shorter than others, with sharpened ends, and made of tempered iron or steel.
And use them with ease when striking the scalpel, so that you don't injure the head and spoil it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary to perforate it around before you use the scalpels with the instruments called non-penetrating probes.
And they are not called that (non-penetrating probes) except because they do not penetrate the bone's surface, since the probe has a rounded tip or edge on the one below the pointed head, like a small edge or circle that prevents it from going further and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
And it is appropriate for you to take a large number of these probes, each suited to the thickness of each bone, so that you have on hand for every skull bone a probe with a sharp tip, its length and shortness being according to the thickness of the skull.
And this is the method for three types of probes: To perforate around a broken bone, you should place the probe on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone is already pierced; then replace the probe in another place, and place whatever is needed between each hole with the thickness of a finger, or around this amount.
Then, with scalpels, cut between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as you can to create a light, airy separation, as we have said, until you have removed the bone, either with your hand or with any other tool, such as fine pliers and forceps.
And you must be very careful that the scalpel does not touch any part of the skull.
And therefore, once you have encircled the bone and separated it from the skull if it is joined to it, and have extracted it, you must file and smooth the rough surface of the bone with another tool similar to a scalpel, but which must be thinner and finer than the other scalpels.
And if any small pieces of bone remain, then remove them easily with the tools you have; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments that we have mentioned.
Another method of operation is gentle, free from fear, which Gualia described and praised highly; and this is his teaching:  It is necessary for you at the beginning to start uncovering the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and most evident, until, when you have uncovered that part and placed below it the end of this slow and gentle scalpel, of which this is the shape:
And it is that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part of it extends in two directions along its length, just as often; so that the lenticular part is adjacent to the skull with its sharp cutting face against the bone.
Then strike the scalpel on one side with a small mallet until you cut the whole bone easily, as it is already loosened, and you are sure that the periosteum will not be damaged in any way that you fear, and if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them, surely, even if he were asleep.
Then if any part of the periosteum remains attached to the bone in some places, cut it off with the lenticular end of the scalpel, and remove it easily, for it is released without injury and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the periosteum, and that which is cut off or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughness and subtle irregularities remain, then it is necessary to smooth out that roughness and eradicate those irregularities with fine razors, for which you have prepared a number of different sizes so that you can apply the most suitable ones in every place and the most appropriate ones according to the way in which you are progressing with your operation on the fractured bone and its shape.
And it is necessary that in your procedure, with which you smooth the bone at the beginning, you use the widest of those razors, and then progressively use the finer ones, and do not cease to do this continuously until you reach the finest and most subtle of them all.
But for each of the other small, capillary fractures and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer treatment according to the way in which you are progressing towards the correction of them.
And it is a cause that is not hidden from all those who have studied in that art. And we have shown, in this writing, what we have written concerning large fractures.
And if the flesh is retracted when you expose the bone, then it is necessary to take a cloth equal to the size of the wound, immerse it in warmed olive oil, and place it over the wound opening; then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and warmed olive oil, placing it over the first cloth, doing so as gently as possible so as not to injure the flesh; then apply a broad bandage, and do not tighten it except to the extent necessary to hold the wound closed.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are certain of a hot abscess; then remove it and then administer medicines that are useful for dryness, such as flaxseed and ground barley, and powders of cinquefoil and similar things.
And you should make a powder from these medicines, ground finely, that is sprinkled on the wound, as they are dry; and generally, administer any medicine to it that has the property of cleansing and not causing pain or irritation.
And be careful, using your skill, that the wound in your treatment is clean; and do not allow pus or anything else to accumulate; nor allow the virulence to worsen; because when it is set upon the flesh of the brain, it will corrupt it and cause decay, and this will produce a terrible evil for the patient.
And the flesh of the head suffers damage, especially when the treatment is disregarded, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, if you see in the patient the symptoms we have described, know that it is very dangerous without a doubt.
And if the blackness is not from the medicine applied, but is due to the properties of that medicine, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these, moisten a cloth and apply it to the head.  Then treat it with the appropriate healing spices until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken in two parts at once, but sometimes only in one of those parts, because it has two bones.  The lower part is cartilaginous, and isn't broken, but only shows bruising, twisting, and a curving.
But if one of the two parts of the nose is broken, you should insert your little finger into the nose, and use your index finger to hold the fracture inward, and your thumb outward, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this with ease, and be careful not to cause the patient pain with your actions.
And if the fracture is in the more prominent part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach it, then it must be manipulated with the tip of a thin, slightly broadened instrument.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same.
And strive for its restoration on the first day after the fracture, if possible; and if not, then approximately on the seventh or tenth day, you should apply a cautious poultice.
And gently insert a piece of linen into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part, or place two pads, if the fracture is in two parts, and make the pads so thick that they fill the nasal cavity.
Some ancient healers suggested that the pads be soaked in broth and changed daily, but I do not find that advisable. Instead, the pad should be soaked in a mixture of beaten egg white and ground powder, and then leave it in place until the bone has set and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a pad, a piece of linen wrapped around a bird's feather is inserted into the nose, particularly if the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is unable to breathe properly.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do it this way, and if you wish, use pads.
And if another abscess appears, apply a plaster of cerot or cotton soaked in sour wine and olive oil, or diachylon to the nose.
But if no fresh abscess appears, then you should plaster the existing one with sesame flour and powdered herbs mixed with egg white; then place a linen bandage over it, and do not bind the nose with anything else.
But if the nasal bones are fractured or broken into small pieces, then you must dissect around them and remove them with instruments appropriate to the task.  Then, repair the fracture and heal it with things that promote flesh growth and consolidation, and with appropriate plasters.
And if a plague develops inside the nose, then you must treat it with pads and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Concerning the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by pus, observe whether the fracture is only on the outside, and not broken in two but bent inward, in which case its repositioning is easy.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you must introduce your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then introduce the said index finger of your right hand; and push the projection of the fracture inward with ease to the outside, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; thus properly aligning it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary to apply extension to both parts according to the straight line until its alignment is possible.
And if you encounter the loosening of teeth due to the break, then bind those you expect to remain with gold, silver, or silk thread; and then place a compress on the fractured jaw, and then place a doubled cloth over that, and place a large, properly made bandage, or a piece of cloth equal to the length of the jaw; and then tie that on above, according to your preparation of the bandage and as its application suits, until it is no longer damaged.
And order the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him easily digestible foods.
And if you estimate that the shape has already been altered in any way, then you should remove and loosen it on the third day; and then rectify what has been altered and plaster it with pounded powder, with egg white, or with flour of rye, after you have removed the compress, and place a soft wool plaster over it.
And then, when that plaster is properly affixed and the bone's position is not altered, leave it, do not remove it until the fracture heals and is strong; for often this fracture is mended in three weeks.
And if another time a boil occurs, then administer what we have said many times for its soothing until it is healed, and the boil is gone.
And if the fracture is with a plaque, then consider if it is a piece of the bone separated or splinters; then you carefully remove those splinters with whatever is appropriate for removing them from the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with leeches, according to the amount needed.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you examine the wound's opening; if it is wide, then apply a suitable plaster to it and allow it to heal until it is sound.
Chapter 5.
Of the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
Often the collarbone is fractured on the front side, near the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
When it is broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without any splinters, it is easy to restore; or it is splintered, and it is difficult to restore; or the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the injured and broken collarbone, and the other extends the neck towards that area.
And then bind the fracture with your fingers until its shape is properly formed, neither protruding nor recessed.
And if you require more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, of a size according to your needs; and extend and elevate the collarbone and compress the pad with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned.
And if you cannot pull the collarbone ends outwards because it has become fixed, then the patient should be laid supine on their neck, and place a cushion of medium size on their muscle.
And the assistant should press the muscle on both sides below until the collarbone bone is elevated from its position, and then you should realign the fracture and bind it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the collarbone and they are loose, then you should cut around them and remove those splinters easily.
And if it is lodged in the bone, then you should make an incision there with one of the scalpels you have prepared for this, after you have placed the instrument used for the chisel below the collarbone; and this instrument is made of wood or iron, of which this is its shape:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
But its length should be as much as is possible for the operation; that it should have two ends like a vise, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the opening of the wound you made when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are sure of a suppurating boil, then you should close the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the opening is small, or you fear a suppurating boil, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's opening.
And if a suppurating boil occurs, then soak a cloth in vinegar, olive oil, and wine, and place it over that.
And be careful not to move the splint from the broken bone.  For this reason, you should see the patient daily, and when the ligaments are softened, or you see the splint has moved, you should then adjust and tighten the bandage.
And then place the patient's bedding over their neck, and place a small cushion under their armpit near the bed, so that their arm is elevated away from the injured area, and this elevates the fracture of the collarbone or shoulder blade, or the arm close to the neck.
Do not loosen the bandage unless a swelling or boil appears in the area within twelve days.
And then renew the plaster if you see the area needs it, and adjust the support and restore it, leaving it until the fracture of the collarbone is restored and has solidified.
And it is strengthened and comforted according to the month in 28 days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is fractured on its outer side, and it is not broken in the middle but at the edges.
And therefore, when it is fractured in the middle of its area— and it is only known by touch—then according to the nature of the fracture, you must prepare it and restore it to its natural shape in any way that is possible for you.
And then place on the area powder of mill with egg white and stop the lion; and then place a doubled cloth poultice; and then place on it a thin sheet of lead, according to the size of the whole shoulder blade or slightly more.
But if under the lead there is a hollow in any part of the shoulder blade, then you must fill that hollow with lion's wool, and then raise the lead to a level.
And then tightly bind over it with long strips of cloth with appropriate constriction and firmness to the lead until it is no longer displaced from its position.
And examine the dressing every day; and whenever it is softened, bind it again and tighten and re-position the lead if it has moved from its place.
And let the patient lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And therefore, when this number of days is completed, then you dissolve the bandage, and be certain that the injury is of the bones, from which the beginning is not feared, nor their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the site of the heavy, pressing bone and place the splint underneath, then you dissect upon it, remove it, and do as we have said in the fracture of the furcula for the treatment of an abscess if it should happen here.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot.
The foot sometimes breaks in the middle, and this heals quickly; but its extremities heal slowly and are crushed.
And of the symptoms when it is broken in the middle, it is that it inclines to the inner parts, and great pain occurs, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and a strong fever, and vomiting of blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is revealed and not hidden from the sensation.
And the restoration of it is to place the patient lying on their back, and place a cushion between their shoulders; and then press on their muscles, and align their sides with the hands of two people on either side, and be meticulous in the operation and in the adjustment according to every way possible and suitable, until the bone returns to its proper shape.
And then place a poultice and bandage over it, and place a thin sheet of willow or linden wood, or something similar in lightness, over it, wrapping it in cloth; then be careful in binding that over the broken bone so it is not damaged; and bind it in a circular shape on the back sometimes, and tighten it with suitable pressure; and then carefully monitor the bandage, and when it is softened, tighten it.
And if the bandage needs to be removed due to irritation, swelling, pain, or an abscess forming in the area, then you should remove and loosen it, remove the poultice, and correct any problems that arose from it with a treatment method; and then reapply the poultice, if needed, and adjust the bandage until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration of the ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fractured rib occurs only in thick areas, being the middle part; and the extremities or ends of the rib on the front side are not damaged in this way, because they are cartilaginous. And its [the injury's] recognition is not hidden from the feeling during the examination with the fingers.
And the restoration should be such that you align the fracture with your fingers in the best possible way, until it is aligned as it should be, and then apply a poultice and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if needed.
And if the fractured rib is angled inward, the patient experiences intense pain and stabbing, like the pain experienced by someone with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the lining; and there is difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood; and this is a difficult condition to treat.
And the ancients were resourceful in dealing with that with great ingenuity.
And from them [the ancients] it is said:  you must give the patient foods that prevent inflammation and gas, so that the belly is not inflated and swollen, and the fracture is driven outward.
However, we would not consider this a light matter for causing a hot abscess if it does not occur; and if it does occur, then it is already helping with that.
And some of them say that it should be placed over a cupping glass and that it should be applied with force; and it seems a reasonable approach, but nevertheless it is feared that the cupping glass will draw the superfluities to the location due to weakness.
And some of them said: the area should be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the dressing is snug when you wrap it around according to its rounded shape; and then the patient should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, in terms of diet and medicine.
And if a severe force injures the patient, who cannot bear it, and the bone pierces the membrane with a damaging puncture, then we fear for the patient.  In that case, we must cut open the area, expose the fractured rib, and then place an instrument that preserves the shape – the description of which comes before– and carefully cut the bone and remove it.
And then we should bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, by stitching, and treat it with plasters until it heals.
And if a boil occurs inside, then you should mix powders in rubbed oil and apply it to the area, and treat the patient with whatever is appropriate for an internal boil.
And let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Of the restoration of fractures of the spine of the back and neck.
Sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the neck, and often in their articulation, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And if this happens to someone and you wish to know if they will be healed or not, then consider this: if their muscles are already softened, numb, dead, and you cannot move them, nor extend or contract them, and when you press them with your fingers or pierce them with a needle, they feel no pain, then know that they are not healed, and in such a condition it is fatal.
And if you move them and feel contraction with your fingers and the puncture, then know that the bone's integrity is intact and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see similar signs in the vertebrae of the neck, and want to know if it will be healed or not, then consider the patient's feet.
Then if you find that the feet are also softened, similar to what happens in the muscles, and if when lying on their back they experience involuntary wind or bowel movements, and sometimes they lie on their backs wishing to urinate and cannot, then know that it is fatal, and do not attempt to treat them.
But if you do not see any of those signs, the condition is better and less severe.
And the treatment for that is to apply a soothing poultice, whether hot oil rubbed on the affected vertebra, or with beaten egg yolks; apply that several times a day until the inflammatory boil is soothed.
And then apply a comforting and soothing plaster, and bind it firmly; and order the patient to rest and be quiet, and not to sleep on the affected area until it is healed.
And if you observe damage to the bone, or any cause that has already separated it from its place, then it is necessary to cut the skin above the bone and remove that bone; then rejoin the two sides of the wound, with stitches if it is large; and then treat it with a healing ointment until it is healed.
But if the back of the bone is fractured in such a way that it is at the end of the bone, then it is necessary to insert the index finger of your left hand into the anus, and align the fractured bone with the other hand as far as possible through manual repositioning; then apply a plaster and bandage, if you need them, and firmly bind it.
And if you find any broken splinters there, then remove them and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the [broken] width/breadth/extent.
The bones of the hips are often fractured, and if they break, then the fracture is usually only a separation of their ends, and they are sliced lengthwise, bending inwards;  the patient experiences pain and throbbing at the site, and the leg becomes numb when fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, in the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only at the end, then you will  secure it according to what is prepared for you, by aligning it until it is rejoined to its natural form.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or already bending inwards, then you should lay the patient on their stomach until the restoration of the fracture is prepared for you. And then, when you have secured it, place a plaster on it, and afterward place a splint of wood or bone on it, and tighten it firmly so you don't fear further puncturing of the fracture or the splint moving.
And secure the hollow with what fills it until it holds the tightness in equality, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a suppurating abscess occurs, then you cease the stretching and restoration until the suppurating abscess is calmed, and place on it what calms it according to what precedes; and then return to the restoration, and tighten it as is appropriate.
And if the bones are shattered or comminuted, then you must set them.
Chapter 11.
Of the restoration of the fractured joint.
Adjutori" is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, one of which is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness in this form:
And two bandages be tied to its two ends, and then it be suspended from an elevated place.
And have the patient lie on a bed; and then place the patient's broken arm over the piece of wood until the joint of the arm is aligned with the middle of the wood's curved area.
And then suspend something heavy over it, or the attendant pulls on the ends; and then the doctor and the attendant hold the fracture with their hands together, until the fracture returns to its proper position.
The other method is that the patient be placed supine on their neck, and the arm be held up by a bandage; and then order two assistants, one of whom holds what is above the fracture with their hands, and the other holds what is below it; and each of them pulls in their direction.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten a bandage over the fracture, and another bandage over that, and each of the two assistants pulls in their own direction.
And therefore, if the fracture is close to the muscle's end, it is necessary to place half of the bandage on the joint and the other half below the fracture, towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then the bandage should be placed over that location and over the elbow.
Apply it easily and without effort, and then, once it is bound as necessary and applied properly, tighten it if no boil or abscess develops.
However, if an abscess forms, then leave the tightening for seven days, and place on it wool soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten it.
And the way to tighten it is to place a poultice over the fracture, then wrap a fresh cloth around the poultice; then adjust the arm on this support, and place their open hand over their own muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the support on the arm so that the arm is in the position of splints, unless any reason from the broken bone forbids this.
And then use splints.
And you place on the fracture that splint which is the widest and strongest of the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the break, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten over the splints with the tightening that I have mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is so that your tightening over the area of the fracture is tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the tightening should be.
And therefore, adjust the positioning of the splints and the tightening as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position; then you do.
And if you fear a suppurative abscess, then you leave the tightening and the splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then consider the ligament in all parts for three days, so that no swelling or inflammation occurs in the area; or, the limb should be deprived of food to avoid the superfluity of tightening; and therefore, rectify all this as we have said.
But if you are confident that no cause for this will occur, then do not loosen the bandage until approximately three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and let their hands be on their stomach.
And place a poultice of full wool soaked in oil on the injured part, and consider at all times of night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted, or that the ligament is softened; therefore, correct all this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order we previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until it begins to strengthen; and then, it is necessary to make the food heavier.
For, according to the custom of the injured limb and leg, they should be strengthened in 40 days; and then, it is necessary that they be loosened, and a bath be administered, and be medicated with ointments that rectify that.
And if the fracture is severely crushed, then do not loosen the ligaments and splints from it for up to 10 days or until two months.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearm bones; of which one is small, and it is the one that sits alongside the said finger, and the other is large and is the one that rests below the small finger, on the lower side.
And frequently the larger forearm bone is broken alone, or the smaller one, and frequently both are broken together.
And when the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then its restoration is easier, and its healing is quicker.
And when the forearm bone is broken below, the fracture is serious, and healing is difficult.
And even more serious than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the broken bone is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is appropriate for the physician, during its restoration, to apply a small extension with ease until it is healed.
But if the large forearm bone is broken, then a more forceful extension is needed.
And if both forearm bones are broken together, then you must apply the pressure much more strongly.
And you must position the hand during the restoration and extension of the bone, resting on a cushion, with the wrist above all the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient be lying on a smooth, hard surface.
And place a cushion in front of him, at his height or level, so the patient does not feel pain.
And then one attendant extends the lower arm with their hand or a bandage, and another attendant extends the upper arm similarly.
And then the physician manipulates the bone until it is reduced to the best possible position.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are complications, then you must use your skill to reduce each piece to its proper place.
And if there appears a separate complication that hinders the healing process and you are not hopeful for its restoration, then you should operate on it and remove it according to the method we have mentioned above.
But if the fracture is with pus, I have already made a separate chapter on this, and therefore take care of that according to that chapter.
And if an abscess arises at the beginning of your treatment, then you should apply a cloth with a plaster made of roasted oil and white wax, and it should be medium in thickness and delicate, and press the cloth firmly over it until the abscess is subsided; and then remove the plaster and apply a prepared poultice of ground powder mixed with egg white, and then place plasters; and let the plaster that is placed over that pus-filled fracture be thick and strong.
And know that the names of the plasters for the arm are found in the major arrangements, or that is, the fracture in one or two parts together.
And then apply your pressure over the fracture site as firmly and vigorously as possible, and the more the pressure is applied to the parts above the fracture or the parts below it, apply the pressure a little more gently according to what is recalled in the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough, and the pressure with which it is held should be medium between delicate and firm, just as we have recounted.
And consider the limb and its ligament for several days. And if any cause arises requiring rectification, such as swelling in the limb, then you must immerse the limb in warm water until the swelling subsides.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the pressure.
And if the constriction is already softened and the bone is already repositioned and similar to the others, then rectify all of that with your skill/expertise.
And consider further if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive constriction, because then you must soften that a little and leave it for several days until nourishment flows to it, and then gently compress it.
But if the patient does not experience any of the causes we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to unbind him/her for approximately 20 days or thereabouts.
And then the patient's hand should be suspended by its own active movement, and allow them to sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 32 days, or a very slight one is restored in 28 days, and all of this is according to the disposition of the complexions and the effectiveness/capacity.
Chapter 13.
Of the restoration of fractures of the finger(s) and of the fingers.
Know that the finger(s) of the hand and the joints of the fingers are easily fractured, and they are often injured by friction.
And when the hand is injured by fracture or friction, then it is necessary that the patient be placed lying down and that a cloth be placed evenly over it, and then place the patient's hand on that extended cloth.
And then the attendant extends the broken bones, and the physician binds them together until they are firmly rejoined.
And then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, if no suppuration has occurred; and then place a splint over it according to the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen.
However, if the fracture is in the parts inside the palm of the hand, then make a bandage in the shape of a sphere, and tell the patient to squeeze that with their fractured palm; then it should be bound with a long bandage.
And let the splint be of leather with a bandage in which it is raised, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and bind it as necessary.
But if the fracture is on the outside parts, then it is necessary that you place a splint on top and another splint on the lower part of the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the bandage, just as the hand is wrapped around the fingers with ligaments.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as needed and then bound to the palm; and if you wish, place a small, straight splint on it so that the fracture is raised and does not move.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or the index finger, or the ring finger, or the little finger, then it should be bandaged and tied to the finger next to it, or all the fingers should be tied together in sequence, which is better; or place a small splint over it, as we said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and then, the arrangement of a hot abscess and its opposite — with your operation — with what is necessary when any of those causes occur, according to the repeated narrative of it.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and is apparent to the sense according to the part it has been broken and the most severe degree.
And the restoration of it is done so that the ligament is tightened over the fracture and another ligament under the fracture, and the patient is laid prone on their stomach and on their face.
And then the physician extends all the ligament to its appropriate position, according to the quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then the ligament should be close to the knee joint, at the level of the hip joint, so that the extension reaches the area above, and the other ligament below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, then the ligament should be positioned close to the knee, and the extension should be toward the parts below.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape and the bone is properly joined; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, lest the affected limb becomes inflamed. But if inflammation occurs, then you leave it for several days until the inflammation subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied like this:  Wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, folding it two or three times, and remove any excess; then wrap the leg until you reach the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and the leg near the knee, in the lower part, and let the ends of the splint extend beyond both parts; then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.
And then place splints on the thigh, over the fractured area, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the gaps between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the fracture is held together.
And then start with a strong bandage in the middle over the fracture site, using three or four wraps; and as you move away from the fracture site, your bandage should be smaller, lighter, and softer.
And then extend the two ends of the splint downward until they reach the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side to ensure the bandage does not shift from its position.
And then leave the bandage on it, ensuring that no corrosion, boil, inflammation, or similar problems affect the limb; and if any of these arise, then remove it carefully, and address whatever happened immediately, as we have mentioned many times.
But if there is a piece of bone protruding, then you should push it back in as much as possible; and if not, cover it and leave it, and treat it with what preceded the remembrance until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh, or other parts to which splints are attached, is tightened, as we said in the treatment of the arm.
However, in the restoration done in this manner, the patient does not experience limping; and if it is restored alone, or the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he limp, as is always the case.
And know that the thigh is kept tight for 40 days, or a little more or a little less, and all of this depends on the diversity of the constitutions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of a fractured kneecap (or kneepan).
Know that a fractured kneecap often results in significant pain, but in many cases it also causes considerable friction (or abrasion).
However, if the injury is a fracture, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this may or may not be accompanied by inflammation, and all of this is determined by feeling (or examination).
And the restoration of it is to bring together the broken parts with strips until they are united and joined as much as possible by means of approximation, ease, and careful work.
And then apply a plaster and place it over that circular area, if you need one; and secure it with appropriate bandages.
And then consider all the methods we have described in other fractures, similar to an abscess or something of that sort, so that every accident is met with what is appropriate to it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the thigh bone; and the other is thin, and is called the shin bone.
And the treatment for any of the types of fracture affecting these two leg bones is similar to the treatment of arm fractures, and thus the repair process is the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is completely dislocated.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is displaced forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it (the fracture) below, and it is among those causes that are not hidden from you.
And then administer extension, reduction, and splinting of the fractured bones accordingly.
However, if the leg fracture is extensive with many splinters, the extension should be less and gentler, and you should alleviate it with your skill.
And if the leg requires any procedure on the arm, and when you have reduced the splinters and completed your entire operation, then you will take pieces of wood, similar to those placed under the supports, and made similarly from palm branches; choose those with a small diameter, and avoid the thickest ones, and their length should correspond to the length of the leg, from the knee to just below the joint.
And then wrap each with a cloth in two layers, according to its length, and place one over the leg on one side and the other on the other side, stretching from the knee down to the lowest part of the foot.
And then bind the two splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle.  With this binding, the leg is prevented from bending to either side, and it remains in a good position.
And now a splint of wood, corresponding to the length of the leg, has been applied; and the leg is placed in such a way that it is supported and prevented from moving.
And this is especially necessary to do in cases of fracture, and when there is an open wound accordingly.
And from now on, check the leg every day and diligently examine it, watching for abscesses, inflammation, or other similar problems.  If any of these arise, apply appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the ankle and bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the ankle itself is not common; however, fractures of the foot bones do occur sometimes; and fractures of the foot's toes are rare, and they mostly experience attrition rather than a fracture in the area of the joints.
And if the foot bones experience a fracture, and those bones are sometimes elevated above each other, then the patient should place their foot on the ground in a way that allows for this elevation.
And then place one foot on what elevates those bones, and then press down and squeeze them until they return to their proper places.
And then apply a plaster and bandage on top, and place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot.
And then secure that with a descending compression, since you have wrapped it with cloths and other materials you need.
And when three or four days have passed, then you loosen the bandage, for you will find the bones either joined, or broken, or dislocated, and the operation for those cases is as you know.
But if any of the fingers are broken, then set them, and join them as I have shown and recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. And then place a splint along the length of the broken finger, and slightly wider than it; and then place that board under the foot, as I have described to you, and tighten it with descending compression.
But if what is broken of the bones is two, three, or more, then you place a splint of its own size, wrapped in linen, on each finger, and tighten the board at the bottom of the foot, and one end of the board should be above the abdomen of the foot so that it is held firmly.
And it is important for you not to forget that you should consider all the things that I have told you about other fractures and accidents; and be prepared for all accidents with the necessary precautions.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the thigh bone, the hip bone, and the penis of the male.
When the thigh bone is fractured, then make a splint with carefully shaped wood, and then slightly incline it towards the back, and hold it in place behind the leg.
And then the midwife fills the thigh with wool, and it should be positioned in the thigh like a bandage; and then the woman should be laid down, and gradually raise her back, for everything must be straightened until the fracture area is positioned properly and the broken bone returns to its place.
Then place poultices on her back, and when she wants to urinate, she removes the wool easily and then urinates, and you reposition and return it in the manner in which you initially treated it, and then return to the initial poultice.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it will be restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and insert a reed tube into its opening; and then insert the entire bladder into the thigh, and then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated within the thigh, for the fracture will return to its place.
And then it should be filled with wool and remain so for several days, as we have described, until it is healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman is fractured, then administer for its restoration and alignment what we have described for the hip bone.
And that which is correct is not hidden in these proximate and relatively minor fractures, especially for one who has some study, use, and understanding of these words in my book; for this fracture indicates to you in the most important cases a direct, straight path to restoration and tightening, and therefore understand well.
But in the case of a fractured penis in a man, take a bird's feather, place it inside the penis, then put a bandage of cloth around it, ensure it is wrapped, and leave it thus for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractures of the bones when afflicted with plague.
It is convenient for the one who suffers a fracture with plague, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, that you bleed them, and perform phlebotomy, as soon as the conditions of phlebotomy indicate it to you, or as we have stated above.
And if the plague flows blood, then it is necessary that you apply a poultice to it in order to stop it, so that you powder it with crushed glass, if no other cause is present.
And then begin restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not delay this, unless an abscess occurs.
However, if a severe abscess occurs, then you leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days in total, for you will cause further harmful accidents.
However, if the broken bone is prominent above the exposed skin, then it is necessary that you forcefully reduce it and enclose it with your hands with ease and little extension.
However, if extension is not prepared for you and the alignment of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight inches, and its width is according to the size of the injury; and therefore it is necessary for the physician to take of these three or four, according to the amount required for this in the treatment of any type of fracture.
And it should be round, and have little thickness so that it is not bent by the pressure upon it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp tip with a margin at its extremities; and let the top of it be thick, tapering towards the middle parts.
And this is its form:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Therefore, it is necessary that the pointed end be placed raised upon the prominent end of the bone.
And you push that in one stroke until the bone returns, and it is aligned with some approximation.
And therefore, strive to align the fractured ends, and if the fractured end is small, and does not accept the instrument properly, then it is necessary that you cut the end of that bone until the instrument has the ability to do so.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have described, then cut it with what is appropriate for bone cutters, which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever manner is possible for you.
And then smooth out what remains of roughness and small splinters on the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and soon after the reduction the patient experiences intense pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do what you believe will greatly benefit the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and if it is summer, specifically, do not apply a plaster or any other oily substance to the wound, so as not to cause festering and corruption.
And then, after administering the styptics during your bone restoration, leave the wound uncovered.  Then cut the wound with shears and use bandages according to the wound's size.
And be very careful not to compress the wound with the fracture, for foolish doctors have often done this, causing death or a corrosive or festering illness—that is to say, gangrene—in their patients. And if your constriction is gentle, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear any of the bad accidents we have described, and you find pain in the area, then you should not place styptics on it, but rather make a bandage of hard cloths in place of styptics, and bind it tightly.
And when, after a day or two, pus has begun to form in the wound, then remove the cloth you placed over it with wine, and then apply poultices, along with ointments with which we customarily treat wounds, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ointments.
And you should loosen the bandage and examine the wound each morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed, and the limb should be prepared in such a way that the pus can drain from it to lower parts with ease.
If the wound persists for many days and is not consolidated or the pus is not draining from it, then know that there are obstructions preventing the pus from draining, so you should examine the wound with probing. And of those obstructions, those that can be separated should be removed and extracted; those that cannot be separated and cause pain in the limb, you should cut them open if possible.
And if the wound is afflicted with swelling or inflammation, or other types of corruption or putrefaction, then you should apply a remedy for that specific condition, as described in the relevant chapter concerning its treatment.
And concerning this, where my instructions end and your expertise begins: when a large bone is fractured, treat the limb as you would a fractured thigh bone or a similar injury to a large limb, and do not attempt to pull or remove it, for often death results from this. Leave it until it can heal naturally. Often this will happen within 20 to 30 days. Then treat the wound if you see fit, or if it doesn't heal on its own.
Chapter 20.
Of the treatment of inflammation that arises in the area of a previous fracture.
Often this inflammation occurs in the area of healing from a fracture, especially if it's near a joint, and the shape of the limb is distorted; and it greatly hinders the natural function of the limb.
Then consider if the inflammation is recent and apply medicines that have a tightening/styptic effect, such as alum, vinegar, myrrh, and ceruse, or similar ones.  Use some or all of these, mixing them with a styptic wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply this mixture to the inflammation on a bandage.  Secure the bandage tightly.
Leave the bandage tight for several days; then remove it and apply another one until the inflammation is gone; or apply a lead sheet to the affected area, as lead has the property of reducing swellings in the limbs.
However, if the inflammation has hardened and become deeply embedded, and removal is necessary, then cut it out from the highest/most prominent part, and remove the excess or slice it with lancets until it is gone.  Then treat the area until it heals.
Chapter 21.
Of the restoration of a fracture, when it is restored and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, not according to its natural strength.
When a fractured bone is set, and afterward the limb remains weak and frail, this is due to several causes: one is an inadequate joining and binding of the limb; or excessive tightening of the ligaments, preventing proper nourishment to the limb; or excessive application of remedies; or inappropriate movement; or insufficient blood flow and weakness in the patient.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishment and make their body supple until the blood is replenished; administer baths; and bring joy and cheer to them.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws nourishment to it, or continue applying warm water compresses until nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of broken bones when they are improperly set and the procedure is not what it should be.
When, after the limb has been reset, there is still crookedness, a prominence on the broken bone, and a swelling, and this is disfiguring the limb's shape, but the limb is nevertheless not impeded from its natural function, then you should not accept the claim that the limb is newly broken.
But many foolish doctors and bone-setters have done this in our land, and this procedure is highly reprehensible, leading to great fear, the sign of which is deadly.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be soaked in lukewarm water in which softening herbs are boiled, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and a softening poultice should be made, such as a well-prepared diachylon; or a mucilage of marshmallow root should be taken, pounded with hen's grease or beeswax oil, and applied with that; or fatty figs should be taken, crushed with pigeon droppings, and similar to those medicines called healers of consolidation.
And sometimes it is dissolved by consistent gentle friction, done with moist hands, and movement of the limb in all directions should be administered at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become hard and bony and requires iron for its treatment, then the pus on top must be stopped and the continuation of the bone must be dissolved, and the excess swelling of the bone must be cut away with very sharp instruments, and ease must be administered through care and skill in this.
Chapter 23.
Concerning dislocations.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place, preventing movement, and distorting the shape of the limb, causing the patient great pain and injury.
Therefore, when an accident causes a dislocation, it is necessary to quickly try to reduce it, and not delay its reduction, for if delayed, the joint becomes inflamed and very hard, making the dislocation difficult to reduce.
And therefore, it is not appropriate to manipulate or extend the limb during the inflammation, because often this causes spasms and lasting pain.
But when this happens, you should then apply leeches to the patient's inflamed area, and let them remain until the inflammation subsides; then, the limb should be bathed in warm water and oil, and then reduced easily.
And every limb is thus cured, so that the memory (or recollection) will bring it back to its place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocations, following the precedent for fractures; from the highest part of the body down to the lowest.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of lower jaw dislocation.
So dislocated are both jaws if not quickly; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their places and slightly softened; or they are completely and fully dislocated, until they are softened at the joint, so that saliva drips from the patient and he cannot keep it in or close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled in his speech.
However, when the dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little effort.
However, if the dislocation is complete and full, then it is necessary that a gentle reduction of it be administered, and not delayed at all.
And it is necessary that the attendant hold the patient's head, and that the physician insert the fingertip of one hand into the site of the jaw dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands are outside, with which he holds; and he commands the patient to cease his jaw movements and to make each part go still; and the physician aligns the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then administer steaming with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And therefore, when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place on those powders of cloth with a cerot (a type of medicated plaster), made of wax and rubbed oil; and then be tied easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be supported between two pillows, so that it does not tilt to the right or left side; and do not force them to masticate anything; let their food be soft and easy to swallow, until when the pains have subsided and the jaws are healed, then let them eat what they want.
And this should be administered easily, and do not exert pressure on the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, and breathing, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws, when dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, then often fever and profuse sweating occur, and the patient's stomach is easily agitated, and easily vomits pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is perilous; and often the one who experiences this dies within a few days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the furcula and the extremity of the muscle.
The furcula is not dislocated from within its connection with the foot; and sometimes it is dislocated outward, and this is evident to the touch.
And the restoration of it is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. And then tightly press the area with your palm, for it will return.
And then apply a poultice and powders, and compress that.
However, the extremity that connects the thigh and continues from it is not dislocated in any single day; therefore, it should be reduced and bound as we have said and as is appropriate for you to do.
And then apply a poultice, powders, and a bandage, and instruct the patient to adhere to rest and quiet until healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of muscle dislocation.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated in any way other than three, of which one is that it is dislocated in part from the upper portion, and in part from the lower portion.
And the second is that it is dislocated in the upper part of the muscle, and this is done forcefully; and it is not dislocated in the back parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in the front parts by the nerves.
And most often it is dislocated and comes out in the lower parts below the upper portion, and most often in those whose flesh is thin, it is easily dislocated; but in those in which there is much flesh, it is forced out with difficulty.
And often accidents happen to some men through blows or falls, and their muscle becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and is swollen because it is already dislocated.
Then you must explore this until you are absolutely certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts near the clavicle; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, for you find a clear difference between them; and you find a concavity at the head of the muscle, and below the clavicle, near the touch of the head of the muscle, like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor move it at all.
If it is dislocated towards the foot or upwards, and you then find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
And a gentle reduction of this dislocation is made when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction of it is that the attendant raises the patient's hand upwards; and then places your fingers below the patient's clavicle, and elevates the joint with strength back to its place, and the attendant raises the patient's hand and extends it upwards; and then places it down, so that it returns easily.
But if, despite what we have said, it does not return, and it has been a considerable time since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and an application be administered that softens and smooths, like a poultice of the roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and be administered.
And then the patient should lie on their back and be placed under the patient's collarbone a ball of wool that is of a moderate tightness, and then the physician places their heel on the ball, and elevates the head of the muscle with strength, and pulls the patient's arm so that it is not moved downwards, and another attendant holds the patient's head, so that it is not moved downwards, because it will quickly return to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner: have a man present who is taller than the patient, and stand on the affected side, and place his arm under the patient's collarbone and lift the collarbone upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another attendant pulls the patient's arm downwards from their belly. But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with them, so that it weighs them down, because the dislocation returns quickly.
And it is easily reduced in another way: a long wooden post is placed in the ground, the top of which is round, like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, and the patient is placed beneath it; then, over the top of the post, heavy cloths are placed; and the patient stands according to the length of the post, and then the patient's arm is extended downwards on the other side; and the patient's body is extended on the other side with force, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if the reduction is difficult due to all the causes we have mentioned, then use this cure: take a piece of wood the length of two arms, and its width four fingers, and its thickness should be moderate, at the level of the collarbone, in this shape:
And over the round top, heavy cloths should be tied so that the wood does not harm the patient.
And then place it under the patient's collarbone, and extend the arm or the upper arm along the post down to the lower parts, and tie the post to the assistance and the arm and the hand's extremity.
Then place the arm on a stepladder of suitable width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the other side of the body is suspended, so that the joint enters quickly.
And when the entry is complete by any means possible, then you should place beneath the collarbone a wool pad of sufficient quantity; and then apply a prepared plaster of ground powder with vinegar and egg white over the entire muscle, wrapping it around; and then bind firmly under the collarbone with proper bandages; and the bandage should wrap over the plaster, and the patient's hand should be attached to their neck, and left undisturbed. Do not move the patient's hand for seven days.
And the patient's food should be limited until the limb is strengthened, for this is more conducive to its recovery.
And then the food should be increased gradually, to seven or five (presumably meaning a gradual increase over a period), and movement should be practiced.  And if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is repeatedly dislocated due to humidity or another cause, then a cautery with three holes, as described earlier in the chapter on cauteries, should be applied.
And if all this is done, and after seven days the bandage is removed, and the joint is not healed, and the plaster and bandages are reapplied several times, and it is still not healed, and the arm cannot be raised, then know that the nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, have been cut, stretched, or softened, and know that the joint will never be put back in its proper place.
For the dislocation of the foot and the breast or back regions, reduction is performed by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to its place.
And another bandage should be applied, and care should be taken until it is healed.
And if, after healing, there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths frequently until the heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original condition.
Chapter 27.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Know that the elbow joint is difficult to dislocate and similarly difficult to return to its proper place; and it is dislocated in all directions, and more so in the front than in the back.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is evident from the pressure or touch, according to whichever way it is dislocated.  And when you adjust the dislocated elbow with your hand, this is manifestly clear to you, for the joint is hollow and the arm cannot bend nor touch its muscle.
And you should act quickly, and reduce the dislocation before it becomes severely inflamed, for if it becomes severely inflamed, its reduction is difficult, and the limb may not be completely healed.  And it is especially difficult when the dislocation occurs in the back parts, because it is worse than all other kinds of dislocations, causing greater pain, and frequently leading to death.
And the restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's arm should be extended by two hands, and the arm stretched out.  The doctor's hands should be on the elbow, above and below it, and he should push the joint with the tips of his fingers together, or with the heel of his palm, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front, then it returns by the doctor bending his hand with his hand, until he strikes the elbow with the heel of his palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous extension and force.
And it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should hold it in that extension so that it does not move back from the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, since it is wrapped with a long folded cloth over the patient's hand, or bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that this aids in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then push the joint with forceful impulse until it returns.
And after the reduction, it is necessary to apply a poultice to the area, which contains astringency and a binding agent with egg white, and it should be bound tightly downwards, and the arm should be suspended from the neck and left in that position for several days.
And then it should be loosened; and therefore, if the joint is positioned correctly, then you loosen the bandage from him and leave him be.
And if you see that the joint is not properly tightened, then you re-apply the poultice and bandage, and leave it for several days until it is tight; and then loosen it.
But if there is a complication during the reduction of the joint, and the affected area is in motion, then administer moistening baths and gentle friction, and compression, until it is relieved; or apply a soothing poultice, that is, a fatty substance, to the joint; and then bandage it, and leave it bandaged on the limb day and night. And then remove the bandage and put the limb in a bath; and when it is soaked, then you rub the joint with gentle friction, and then reapply a soothing poultice, which is oily material, one time, and the second, and the third. with intervals of bathing, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place a warm, moist cow's hide over the affected area, and bind it tightly; and do this several times, for it is moist and brings the area back to its proper position.
Chapter 28.
Of the treatment of a dislocated shoulder, that is, of the joint between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated shoulder (malassen of the hand) is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of its dislocation is easy; the opposite is true of other joints, but nonetheless, speed is essential in its reduction at the moment of dislocation before the area becomes inflamed or a suppurative inflammation occurs there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's hand joint on a table, and the attendant extends the arm.  The physician then places their hand or palm over the area above the joint, and pushes until it returns to its proper place.
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm is already facing the stomach of the hand; if so, the patient should place the back of their hand on a table during the extension and reduction.  And if the dislocation is in front of the back of the hand, then the patient's hand should be positioned accordingly on the table, so that the physician's hand can apply pressure to that joint area.
And so, if it returns quickly, all is well.  But if not, then hold it firmly, while preventing inflammation and leaving it be; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, it will not tolerate nor allow success in its reduction, if days pass.
However, if the joint remains crooked; and you find no cause in the patient, only that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves are severed or strained.  In such a case, there is no remedy other than applying cautery near the affected area, and applying firm pressure on the area.
Therefore, once the injury is healed, apply a bandage as previously described, and let it remain firm for five days.  Then, loosen it, leave it off, and exercise the patient's hand.
But if the movement of the affected area is hindered and you find some heaviness, then soothe it with hot water and friction several times, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in various ways.
And when one of those fingers is dislocated either towards the palm or towards the back of the hand, then extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your fingers until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it over the part to which it was dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is properly aligned in its own place.
And when it is night, bandage it according to that description, and do not cease unbinding and exercising it with movement during the day, and bandage it at night; and do this for several days until it is firm.
And do the same if it is dislocated towards the back of the hand, and bandage it to that part and do your first operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts of the body.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of dislocations of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation occurs in any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and the affected vertebrae remain significantly displaced from their positions, then in such a case there is no cure, for death is imminent for the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's bowels discharge involuntarily, and they cannot retain them; and often some of the patient's limbs are paralyzed – two legs or two arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is displaced from its place, for often it is displaced and often the displacement is done in four directions.
Therefore, this is already displaced behind and is called a dislocation.
But the treatment for this is that you should consider if the dislocation occurred due to youthfulness, because in that case there is no cure nor complete healing.
But for that which comes about by accident or by impact or similar causes, the Ancients described various methods of treatment at length, from which the most beneficial can be learned; however, I have already abridged the details which would have been excessive in their length, due to my proximity to your understanding.  My exposition, using various instruments, will now demonstrate and explain this.
And of those, only the one that occurs on the back, as I am recommending, is curable.
And it is necessary that the patient be laid on their face near a wall, and a soft padded instrument be placed under them so that their foot is not dragged.
And then a straight piece of wood should be placed, driven into the ground at the end of the wall near the patient's head, and another piece of wood should be placed beneath the patient's feet at the opposite end of the wall.
And one attendant should hold the first piece of wood, and it should not be placed in a hole; and another attendant should hold the other piece according to the same form.
And then wrap a cloth over the patient's head and firmly tie a strong bandage around the forehead; then extend the bandage to the piece of wood placed near the patient's head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around the patient's hips, thighs, and legs; and finally, tie all the bandages to the other piece of wood placed near the patient's feet.
And now each attendant should extend the bandages to the corresponding piece of wood, and the two pieces of wood and the bandages should not be moved from their respective positions, but nevertheless, they should not be fastened as we have described.
And the physician places their palms on the spine with strength until it returns to its proper position, or until a table is placed there, and then they adjust their feet on the table until it returns.
But if it does not return in this way, then take a table whose width or length is approximately three arms' length, and hollow out a space in the wall near the patient where the end of the table will fit. And then place half of the table on the spine, and the physician places their feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is straightened and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open with a turning device operated by hand; and you place two pieces of wood at the patient's head and behind their neck, each one arm's length in length.  Similarly, place two more pieces of wood behind the patient's head, each one palm-width apart.  A hole should be drilled into each piece of wood, through which the turning device can pass, and each should be firmly secured to the ground so as not to move.
And a round post (or rod) is placed on which the turning device is situated, and it is turned within the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at the end of this (the round post) is a hole into which the post fits, whose length is a palm's width where it is turned; and in the other two pieces of wood, there is something similar to this.
And now tighten the bandages you have placed on the patient's feet in the hole that is towards their head, and the bandages that are on their thighs in the device that is toward their feet.
And now, next to each turning device, stands a helper who turns the device with their hand, while the physician straightens the spine as we have described.
And after the spine is straightened and the area is adjusted, then apply a thick plaster with egg white, and then linen; and after that, place a wooden splint over the plaster, whose width is about three fingers, and whose length covers the affected area of the spine.
And then bandage it with the bandage we have described, and have the patient use subtle nourishment until they are healed.
And if any lingering issue remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then medicines that soften and soothe should be administered using the method we have described for a long time; and a lead lamina should be applied to that area.
And sometimes a protrusion occurs in the lower part of the spinal column, and it is caused by that dislocation; and that bone that protrudes should not be treated with this medicine, because it could easily cause death.
Chapter 31.
Of the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint should only experience dislocation, and not the sort of partial displacement and cavity-related issues that occur in other joints.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and less so forwards or backwards.
And the sign of a dislocated hip inwards is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the injured leg, the injured leg is longer and the knee is more prominent than on the healthy side, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards their groin.  And the area where the groin is tender and inflamed, marked by a hot abscess, is because the head of the thigh bone has moved there.
The sign of dislocation outwards is that the symptoms are the opposite of those with inward dislocation.
The sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient's leg extends fully, but cannot bend without pain in the knee, and if forced to go forward, they cannot go further forward.  Their urine is retained, the groin is inflamed, and they walk on their heels.
The sign of a backward dislocation is that the knee does not extend, nor can the patient bend their leg towards their groin. The patient's leg is shorter than the other, the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh bone is towards that area.
However, the reduction of these types of dislocations requires you to consider if the dislocation is old and longstanding, already accustomed to its position.  If you apply reduction then it remains in its position; this is not a complete cure, and therefore you should not rely on this method alone for a complete cure.
However, in a recent dislocation, one of the four types, you should attempt to manipulate the joint both inward and outward, and to the right and left, because it will likely return easily and require no further treatment.
However, if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the patient's leg from the lower part, either with their hands, or with a bandage tied above the knee.  Another assistant should extend the patient's upper arm in such a way that they place their hands below the patient's armpits.  Then, tightly wrap a strong bandage around the thigh, and a third assistant should hold the bandage's end.
And its extension should be either from the inside of the knee to the groin area, or from the back to the buttock area.
And all of these extensions should be performed at once until the patient is lifted off the ground by their body weight and hangs suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four types.
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have described, it is good; but if not, then for every type, it is necessary to describe the specific treatment.
In the specific reduction of a dislocation, when it is dislocated and the dislocation is on the inner side, the patient should be placed on their right side; then place the ligaments on the root of the thigh in the area between the head of the thigh and the area below the groin; and then extend the ligament from the groin area to the highest part of the groin.
Then another strong assistant should take the patient's arms, and firmly grasp the thick part of the affected thigh, and extend it outward with forceful extension, for this will return it to its place.
And this type is of easier treatment, with which this limb is reduced than the other types.
But if you are excused and do not follow the complete procedure with this type of treatment, then it is necessary to tie the patient's two feet together with a strong, light bandage, around both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each be about four fingers, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by a length of two fingers.
And then let the patient be suspended from the top of the post, and be in the house; and let the patient's height from the ground be about two arms' length.
And then command a strong young man to hold the top of the thigh, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, and the other young man, pressing the thigh with strength,  will push, for the joint will return to its place quickly.
However, in the proper reduction, when the dislocation is outward, the patient should lie on a bed, as we have previously described when the knee was bent; and the bandage should be firmly secured around the affected leg and the patient's foot.
Then two posts should be placed, one at their feet and the other at their head; and then posts should be placed fitted in the middle of a bed, draped with damp cloths, so that the patient is not harmed by the post being between their thighs, so that the extension to the lower parts is not pulled.
And then each attendant should extend on their side, and the physician with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then the leg should be slightly extended, and it is according to this same description on a bed; and the physician places the palm of their right hand on the afflicted limb, and then grasps it with the other hand, and with this grasping they pull the extended part downwards to the area of the injury.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then the patient should not be extended downwards, but raised up;  instead, they should be placed on a hard surface, just as one would do for a sprain if their hip is dislocated outwards, following what we have said about lying them on two pillows; and they should lie on their side, and the ligaments should be extended, just as we have said, not much.
And pressure should be applied with a cloth to the location of the affected joint.
Therefore, when the reduction is complete – and the sign of its success is not hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's legs, and when you see them aligned and the patient squeezes their leg and expands it without hesitation, then know that the limb is properly returned – and then you close the thighs and place a bandage and bind it firmly so that the hip is not moved in any direction; and let the patient rest for three or four days.
Then remove the bandage and the splint, and compare one leg to the other.
Now, if you see them aligned properly, then know that the dislocation is now fixed, and then release the patient.
And if you see any signs of swelling, then you re-bandage and bind it according to your initial method, and leave it for three days.
And then release it, and have the patient walk with support for a few days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of a dislocated knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, inwards, downwards, and backwards; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply their leg to the thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all these ways is that you have the patient lie straight, so that they extend their leg as much as possible; place your two hands on their face, and place their foot between your feet; and then apply your hands to their knee, and hold them between your fingers on the knee firmly, and another attendant extends their foot until the knee returns to its place.
A sign of its repositioning is that their leg will adhere to the thigh with effortless ease.
And then bandage it and fix the leg to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for several days, until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction of it by you is excused, then administer strong extension with ligaments, as previously described in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
The ankle is sometimes dislocated by a slight movement, and sometimes dislocated according to the completeness of the displacement, and the dislocation is either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that the ankle often swells towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment for a slight dislocation is a gentle return; it is to be extended easily with the hands and pressed until it returns to its place.
However, in treating a complete dislocation, you must have the patient lie straight, and have a strong and able assistant hold the back of the foot on the affected side, in the middle of the area.
And then you, with your right hand on the highest part of the foot, and with your left hand on the lower part of the foot, at the location of the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left twice, and then extend with your left; and push the foot's ankle with your right toward the leg without difficulty.
And do this twice, as we have counted.
And then push the ankle of the foot onto the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
Therefore, if it returns in one or two attempts according to this method, and if you see the foot swollen, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, for that returning.
But if you are prevented from reducing it by what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and place a firmly fixed mat between their thighs, and you have already placed a cloth over them so that the patient does not get hurt.
And then the patient's assistant holds their thighs, and another assistant extends the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied around the foot's ankle; and each assistant extends against the other's extension, and the mat is placed between the patient's thighs to hold it, so that the patient's body is not pulled away from the parts below their extension.
And then the physician grasps the dislocation with their hands, and another assistant holds the healthy thigh in the lower parts, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And therefore, when the dislocation returns and the success of its reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot to the leg with bandages.
And you should be careful or guard against the nerves which are located behind the heel, so that the bandage on it is not forceful and hurts it severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is softened, tighten it.
And then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and prohibit the patient from movement for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be dissolved and corrupted, and after that it will not receive a cure.
And if an abscess occurs, then you must apply what we described earlier, in another place for treatment and poultice, until it is removed.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the toes of the feet.
It is necessary that the dislocated [toe] be pulled back with gentle traction, without exertion; and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in one of the toes of the foot, then it is necessary to have the patient place their foot on a soft surface, such as the ground or a table, and remain positioned as if walking.
And then, stand yourself, and place your foot on the area above the joints, and then press down on it with your foot firmly until it returns to its place, and you see that it is now in place and no longer appears as a bulge.
And then place a board beneath the sole of the foot that covers the entire foot, with two ends, and then secure it with decent and firm bindings for three days; and then release the bindings and keep the patient from walking for many days, until the healing is established and the return to normal function is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocations that are caused by a bruise, or by a fracture, or by both together.
When any of those causes occur, and you exert yourself in the treatment and restoration, death often results.
Therefore, one should not presume to treat such cases, but only those skilled in the art, who have long experience, are merciful and compassionate, cautious, not rash or presumptuous; and who, in the beginning, use only medicines that ease hot inflammations, and leave the patient to divine judgment, except for those in whom there is hope of recovery from the illness, and in whom there appears some hope. Then strive to immediately effect reduction in the beginning of the cause, before a hot inflammation develops.
And if the limb returns as desired, then administer a regimen that alleviates hot inflammation and treat the bruise with whatever desiccant ointments are appropriate.
And if a dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated, then you must treat the fracture, and do what has been said regarding simple illnesses for the injuries in those places.
Guard and avoid, according to your ability, that which is within the paths of fear, just as my teaching has preceded you; for this is better for you than your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more beneficial to your true body during your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
