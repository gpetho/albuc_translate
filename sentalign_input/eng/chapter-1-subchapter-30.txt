 CHAPTER THIRTY.
On cauterization of the spleen.
 When you have treated disease of the spleen by the means that we have mentioned in the section and your treatment is ineffectual, there will be three ways of cauterization, each of which will be correct.
One is to make three or four cauterizations in a row over the long axis of the spleen like the cauterization of the liver, a figure of which has been given above.
 Let there be between each pair of burns a finger's breadth or a little more.
Let the cautery be of the same shape as described above under cauterization of the liver.
Do not put pressure on the cautery.
Have the patient's body supine.
The second method is to heat the cautery provided with two prongs, described in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder.
Lift up the skin over the spleen at the level of the patient's left elbow; and let the fold of skin lie across the patient's body so that the cauterizations will fall longitudinally.
Then push in the two prongs, well heated, till you have pierced the skin from side to side.
Then take out the cautery; and there are four cauterizations.
Or if you prefer you can burn with the other cautery, of three prongs.
Then dress the site of cauterization after you have allowed pus to run therefrom for many days.
This is more effective than any of the preceding treatments.
