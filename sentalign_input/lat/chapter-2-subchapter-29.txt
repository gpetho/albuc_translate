On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Chapter 29.
Sometimes rough, unsightly crusts accumulate on the surfaces of teeth, both on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums. The teeth may become dark, yellow, or green, and this decay can spread to the gums, making the teeth unsightly.
You should have the patient sit between your hands with his head in your lap and scrape the molars and any other teeth where you see crusts or sand-like substances until nothing remains. Do the same for the discoloration—black, green, yellow, and others—until the teeth are clean.
If you remove what is there on the first scraping, that is good. If not, repeat the scraping on another day, a second time and a third, until you achieve the desired result.
Be aware that teeth require scrapers of various forms and shapes, according to the needs of your work. For instance, the scraper used for the lower part of a tooth differs from that used between teeth, in other forms.
And you should have these forms of scrapers prepared and ready, as you can observe.
