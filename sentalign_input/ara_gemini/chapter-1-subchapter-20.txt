Chapter twenty on cauterizing the molars and the relaxed gums.
If the gums are loose due to moisture and the molars are loose, and you have treated them with medicines and they have not been effective, then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then heat the cautery iron, whose image comes after this, after you place the tube on the tooth and insert the hot cautery iron into it quickly and hold your hand for a short time until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Then lift your hand.
Then repeat the cautery as many times as you want.
Then the patient fills his mouth with salt water and holds it for an hour and then spits it out.
For the loose tooth will be fixed, and the loose gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry up.
