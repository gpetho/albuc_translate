On the treatment of men's nipples that resemble women's breasts.
Chapter 47.
Sometimes the nipples of certain men become swollen at the end of sleep (that is, when they begin to be affected in sleep), until they resemble women's breasts, and they remain disgustingly infected.
Therefore, he who detests this must cut over the nipples with a crescent-shaped incision, in the form from line b. to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Next, fill the wound with healing medication.
Then bring together the two edges of the wound with a suture, and care for it until it heals.
If, however, the nipple sags downward and becomes softened due to its size, as happens to women: then it must be split on its two upper sides with two incisions similar in shape to a crescent, each one connected to the other at their ends, until the larger line contains the smaller, in the form from line b. to line g. Then, scrape off the skin between the two edges, remove the fat, and apply what we have mentioned about suturing and powders, as necessary for healing, until it recovers.
If, however, you do not complete the incision as needed due to the patientâ€™s restlessness or excessive blood flow: then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it eats away the remaining fat.
Then care for it until it heals.
