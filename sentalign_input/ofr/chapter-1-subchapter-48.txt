When swelling occurs in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery go a little into the thick part of the flesh;
then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes one makes a cautery on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and yet no one should undertake this unless they are knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
