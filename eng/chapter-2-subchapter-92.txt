 CHAPTER NINETY-TWO.
On incision for the worm arising beneath the skin, called 'the cattle disease'.
 This complaint is called by us in some regions 'the cattle disease' since it frequently happens to cattle.
It is in fact a small solitary worm generated between the skin and the flesh, that creeps all over the body, both up and down; it can be felt as it creeps from one part to another until it breaks out at a place where it can break through the skin, and out it comes.
It arises from the putrefaction of certain humours as do worms, round-worms and gourd-worms in the abdomen.
Part of the harm that may be expected of it is that when it creeps about the body and goes up to the head and reaches the eye it may make an opening in the eye and come out and destroy the eye; this frequently happens.
If you wish to treat this and extract it, it must be done while it is creeping about and can be felt.
You must tie a tight tourniquet above and below it, then cut down upon it and extract it.
But if it burrows into the tissues and you cannot locate it, then apply the actual cautery to the place until you have burnt the worm.
The greatest damage to be feared from it is damage to the eye, as we have said.
So if you see that it has entered the head and is near the eye, then bind a strong bandage over the forehead beneath it, then cut down upon it and draw it out.
It is important also for the patient to take care to cleanse his body with laxative medicines from all corrupt and evil humours.
He should also avoid all foods giving rise to putrefaction.
