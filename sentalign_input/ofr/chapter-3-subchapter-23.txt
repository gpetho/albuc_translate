Here begins the book of dislocations
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is deformed, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When a dislocation happens to someone, it must be reduced immediately without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps it is difficult to put it back in place; therefore, it should not be moved while it is swollen: it often causes spasms and other pains; however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave it until the swelling has subsided; then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then reduce it gently, and treat each limb as the treatment comes to its place.
And I have arranged the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
