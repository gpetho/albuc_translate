On the incision of flesh growing on the gums.
Chapter 28.
Often a fleshy growth, called *abuluss* by the ancients, appears on the gums.
You should suspend it with a hook or hold it with forceps, cut it at its root, and allow pus or blood to flow.
Then apply ground alum or other styptic, drying powders to the area.
If the growth returns after treatment, as it often does, then cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
