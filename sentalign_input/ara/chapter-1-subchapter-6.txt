Chapter Six.
On Cauterizing Lockjaw.
Lockjaw that is treated with cautery is only of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
Avoid cauterizing the type that occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you have treated this type of lockjaw with irrigations, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, it is appropriate to cauterize the patient with three cauterizations.
One at the base of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the joining of the lips.
And make your cauterization on the side opposite the diseased side, because the relaxation will occur on the side that appears healthy.
The method of cauterization is that you cauterize with a cautery opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb.
Bring down your cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin, and this is the image of the cautery, and it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has been presented previously, except that it is a little finer, as you see.
The scalpel should be slightly thicker, then treat the area as mentioned previously until it heals, God willing.
