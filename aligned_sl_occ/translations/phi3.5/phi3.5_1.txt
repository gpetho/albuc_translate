Listen children, you have completed this book which lies at the very heart of medical science due to its thoroughness and because it is presented in such detail; through your explanations, expositions, and declarations within, I see that you fully understand even complex surgical topics discussed herein. (This translation attempts to maintain as much of the original phrasing's intent while translating into modern English.)
When the operation is humbled in our region and at all times private, until then I witness it; and do not disturb him except with some small descriptions found freely among Ancients' books, which I change to correct errors and these intentions are closed within them, along with his deep thoughts and art.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And I have seen that you must vivify (revive or come back) this subject as it is described in the second part of our discussion and exposition; so that through proper use of cauterizing tools and other instruments used herein, which preparation is necessary.
May be the reason why no one dares to abandon their craft at the hand of us nowad0ne1, for medicine is long-standing and it's time we exercise our skills in anatomy which Gualia knows well within understanding the proper use (conjunction/separation) of body parts; including bones, nerves, muscles, names thereof, circulatory pulses at rest, quiet states, veins, locations for bodily waste removal.
Through what Aquilus says is our motivation, may it be small in the work at hand, and mostly within the practice of medicine as a whole.
May we already have explained to him about that in the entrance of this book; who does not know what we have told him regarding anatomy, will fall into error and thus serve death if he has seen so much of these things, which are formed herein and taken from this science.
Here is the line-by-line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
Here comes another doctor who commands that the patient swallows a stone from within which had processed in his state; this stone was large and entered into him/her and they extracted it using a tool from the bladder, so that this home (patient) would die on the third day.
And you have already called for it to be removed therefrom (from the body), and because of the greatness of the stone and due to the disposition of the malady, approached undernethy where death will come forth.
And another doctor takes the salary of our duke from this land for surgery, and brings in a black instrument that was used to break his thighbone; with forceful pressing on dirt, pillows, and sturdy tables without letting him breatse out.
Here's the line-byse translation:
And you called upon him/her, using the ligature to untie it, and thus achieved peace and relief from their pains.
Even though corruption has been confirmed in the body part, it cannot be restrained there and will not cease to spread within until when the malady reaches its apex (or climax).
And another doctor pierced an abscess, and it became ulcerated within days, while the cunning of him grew stronger towards his lordship every day.
The cause is that the head suffers from melancholalgy humors; not because it will come to him entirely with these properties, but rather one of his members which has been held down throughout now experiences this effect.
And for these reasons, boys, it is necessary that the operation be planned in two parts: one related to health (the expected benefit of surgery), and another concerned with major procedures (potential risks or complications).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Thus, take up your weapons in solicitude and for the protection of God, and hold back your illnesses from decay and closure.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate into English line by line as follows:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout When there's not a sickness ill-natured by humors, doctors cannot give the disease name.
And you have already fallen short of this free treatise by three chapters.
Begin with the division of the free (possibly referring to a body or limb), and start from the primary section/partition. The ordered first chapter within the body' extranmity enters in forms of instruments and hot irons for use herein.
The division of the second part. The Second Chapter on incision and puncture, cauterization with vinegars (vinegar-based solutions), poultices, and extracting herbs/similes for those purposes, all these tools are properly organized according to their forms.
The third part of restoration and dislocation, as well as treatment for twisting injuries and appearances to these matters; the head is ordered within the body' extricating weights from limbs (and instruments).
When you examine the quality of that cautery and its non-essential parts, and where it is forbidden to use a cauterization:
So the translation of this medieval medical treatise line by line into English would be:
So it is said that the pointed cautery comforts all of the body'dictly, with the exception of two kinds of complexes, which are parts of his material substance.
In the complexity of a dry and dehydrated body matter; those who use cupping are beneficial to that which is dried out, while others apply what opposes it, for such treatment is not suitable in illness characterized by both quality and dryness, wherein nature itself embodies these qualities—and the appropriate remedy involves moistening and treating this body water.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And those who speak against it say that with cautery they can effectively treat all of this dry and severe joint pain experienced by men, when you compare the man'se body part (the "cors") with your humidities (the "humiditatz"), thus bruising the man's joint.
Through that speech of his, I have already discovered some things for myself.
Mays even if he needs to withdraw the one that has already been probed and exercised in the place of cauterization for today'thy exercise, and understands the complexity of human composition as well as the disposition of diseases within them, along with their causes and accidents, including the time span of these ailments.
May in other complexities not be due to fear but mainly from the swelled and moist humors involved; all doctors agree on this matter and refrain from bleeding therein.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May the medicine burn reach that which he languishes in his body parts and forcefully bring it to the ill member difficult to cure and strongly withdraw from him.
May the focus (or center), because of its sublimity and substance benevolence, does not create excess unless there is an overflow E even now we are known to you through experiments and long years of servitude in learning this art concerning the truth about causes; hence by word alone one would be excused from the lengthiness of discourse here. Herein during our pause I secretly intend what benefits me at my free will, which surgical actions on limbs (and their healing) demonstrate through philosophic discussion—a knowledge that sharpens in your mindfulness.
And scholars, who understand that it is best for performing cauterizations and intervals in the earliest part of spring.
Even you say that cautery is convenient at all times, in order for the harm caused by water entering through the wound to be drawn into the place where it was applied; and more so if the cautery is used for pains or necessary bandages, which do not suffer delays due to fear of those heals that come from bad intention, such as minor injury far outweighs major damage coming over time.
So you do not touch your feet or thighs; for they are esteemed only by the common people and simple physicians, so that healing through cautery is not complete at once, nor does one stop its consequences immediately.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "The cause is not given when they want it, for cautery instruments are only used in medicine that alter complexity and evaporate the humours which are causes of pain.
Maytimes, excessive use of caustics is necessary in medicine due to the vitality and vigor of one'thy work and greatness of thy lordship.

And in the instruments of cautery as ordered hereinabove (and within their feet), they have arranged them accordingly that anyone seeking from him may obtain it easily.
The primary section/chapter (assuming "Le capitol" refers
The first section/chapter addresses the following points:
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the humors to be expelled by medicine at the head'dictatingly three or four times, according to what exhorts from the nature of the patient and their custom.
Return the command given to his head with a razor, and place that which you hold between your hands on an elevated bed so as not to have them resting on their chest.
Return your hand resting on the back of your own palm and place it under your foot between the soles, where you have placed another cushion or servant for support as needed: Whenever the touch of heat arrives at that spot, it indicates an attempt there and with fire (the heated instrument), apply this same form for treatment.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And there it is placed over that spot tenderly touched by temptation, wherein the blood becomes slightly contracted—and you turn it about here.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return (then) apply some salt and dissolve that over the place and leave it there for three days.
Return your hand over the patient's chest, where that which has been broken down in the area of the wound is placed therein (or inside). Return care to the area where the snake'dictum is within so that it may heal.
And when a slave is bound tightly and their bra straps are tied securely in such a way that they feel better and more comfortable.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And when it is necessary that their navel be cauterized within the body and where instruments are inserted has been hardened, so do.
When it is necessary for fluid (or humors) to drain from bone and when its care is required, then so do provide that which allows the discharge of fluids from the bone and attend to its treatment
And if there are other means than the use of caustics to reach down into the bone within which they enter and harden it before excretion occurs again inside the body—this is considered a minor form of cauterization. E from that place exhales the breath of the head.
And if there has been an abscess present for a long time, then treat it until it is healed inside out.
May I not see these diseases' various cautery instruments all at once; but in learned men by way of fear—and so that you may be healthier when it comes to my head, which is elevated for the continuity of life as we have testified herein with other members, and particularly when the head of the abdomen swells naturally.
The translation of this medieval medical treatise line by line would be as follows in English:
Second Chapter (assuming "Capitol" refers metapthy
And with regard to or concerning the treatment of the head, now we come on
When there is a chronic and long-lasting headache associated with prolonged malaise (illness), doctors use knives and cupping therapy, along with scalp massages, liniments and poultices—and mainly if already cauterized by such treatments; consider the situation furthermore when there is great calcification in the nature of this malady's head region. Note that it does not involve severe aggression or excessive force as remedies, rather another form of treatment applied to these specific causes should be considered if necessary (after cauterization). Return that over the head of your own neck for cauterization while the spinal column is divided. Cut the ribcage and expose the bone quantity we've recorded and cauterize that portion in the back part of the head where it is being called upon, which is also where a bellows breathes (vents). And raise your hand so high, and do not discover the bones, for when humors attack violently it causes a great pain different from pains treated by other cautions of the head.
Here, apply this cautery in its place, for when the cautery is where it belongs, and there are subtle cauteries undernethy's head that belong to what has been cauterized at the head of his skull; thus is the form.
Capital termination (assuming 'capitol' refers to
From cautery of hemorrhage, not ancient." - This line suggests that the method being referred to is a form of treatment for bleeding (hem
When the sharp pain in my joints occurs during a game or when it is stretched out within the elbow (elbow), medical treatments should be applied by doctors who deal with such maladies; and these remedies are mentioned here as well, yet I have not fully appreciated them. The cauterization performed in this case comes down to two types of treatment: either acute combustion medicine or iron (referring possibly to an ancient practice using hot metal for healing purposes). Herein lies the lack of complete understanding until one considers these dual methods, with their practical use being quite evident.
Maycurets in medicine burn that you hold an iron lump and extract the limbs of both with them. Return (or apply) the location of pain to where there is a sharp lance inserted within its hidden place in the neck joint; herein lies the source sentence'dict:
E strengthens over him who has been immobilized due to descent constraint, and places it there for three hours; then tighten the bandage around him wherein his body is wrapped up within these bounds.
Return that which is inside for its healing.
If you come, take some of these burning remedies that you have written down in the section on burn treatments.
According to this method of cautery, iron is used as follows:
And when the head is called for with a tightening of clenching jaws and it appears in its curved form here within this place where there's slight elevation,
Return the pause over the location of pain, and hold your hand—so that it is not frightened by what just happened (what was done), gradually turn the small iron back at speed.
If the amount of blood that is secreted through the rectum reaches a point where your hand must intervene to prevent it from being expelled (i.dict), then hold onto this part with your palm such that the artery in question does not become constricted, thus avoiding bile discharge.

Caustic treatment of ancient migraine": The given Latin-influenced text appears to be describing an old method for treating what is referred to
When treating ancient migra0 (migraine), and what has been said about their cure, if not properly applied or at all, sometimes for the ailment that does not heed even this water used in medicinal treatments like scraping with needles to ignite them within where they will become white, you place these points above the line of long duration—that is, over what area corresponds precisely (the locus of said migraine), pour some liquid there and rest your hand for a period inside such incision made by bamboo while it penetrates to arrive at one's abdomen.
However it is necessary for you to guard against the continuous movement of the jaw, which grinds due to chewing, and ensure that there' extruding (protrusion) isn't present nor do the nerves causing such condition arise; so as not to induce spasm.
If it is about the guardianship and caution of blood flow from an artery that bursts, therein lies fear in him who does not know what causes this breakage and how to stop or treat; therefore perform the operation on him with care.
When time for recalling the flow of sanctioned accidents according to our medical tradition comes here in this place.
If from this illness we do not supply the necessary treatment for that which is cut off by dysentery and if our cauterization occurs at the head of the abdomen as recorded hereinabove, then treat within to heal whatever lies inside thereof.
If you come, administer the one which we have mentioned in the chapter of heat treatment with hot iron needles for two cushions, and this is better to treat it furthermore.
Capital V.: (This line is not provided in the original text
For alleviating joint pains of fingers/toes: use caustic treatment for pain relief from fingertubules or toe tubules, respectively.
When the finger/toe experiences pain due to inflammation and it is treated for its causes which may include blockages or other conditions I mentioned earlier, then caustic treatment (the one referred in this division) with a lancet of sorts serves as relief; herein lies that specific method:
And apply points with the cautery, and carry it throughout the entire body cavity or along any swolthy parts if there is pain in those areas as well. Long enough are these cauldrers of silver for you, who seek the place that tries to tempt your hand (or tool).
If all points of pain in the entire body are touched by the caustic and treated herein, take care that those locations where they have been healed remain so.

For lanceting of ulcers or sores, refers typically to a medical treatment involving making small incisions
The ulcer which is treated and the act of lanceting are only by spices that come through vapors (or fumes), as discussed in the divisions of diseases hereinabove mentioned, according to this treatise's contextual clues on medieval medical practices. Here "turtura" likely refers to a sore or ulcerated area being treated with specific remedies derived from spices carried by vapors into the body through breathing (fle

When you treat that spice for ulcers and purgation with cauterization (a form of treatment), ensure your own healing is not harmed by the act of burning those humors in the abdomen: first, use a golden hairpin; secondly, apply gentle touches from one temple amulet to another; lastly, place two lips together for protection. Here "razit de la aurelha" refers specifically to using something made of gold (possibly as an anti-inflammatory or protective measure), and the mentioning of hands symbolizes both personal care during such treatments in accordance with medieval medical rituals concerning internal cauterization.
Pause the act of lanceting for opposing parts of an ill section; only there does it soothe not in any other healthy portion as per this medical viewpoint from a historical context, highlighting selective treatment based on symptomatic regions during cauterization procedures. Here "partida malauta" points to the diseased or affected area that needs gentle handling by

When apoplexy (stroke) is ancient and the remedies we have been discussing do not confer your physician's care nor affect feverish patients, then you must employ four types of caustic treatments: over each head joint; on top of their skull area where treatment was given as discussed; and in cases involving a concussion or trauma to the brain. The use of cautery is said to be according to what has been previously mentioned.

Here we see a remedy from medieval times where heat and restraint with cloth were used to manage hair-related infestations by pests like lice ("malaute").

If pain enters the joints or other connections and causes motion within them, it is necessary that one perform cautery on each of these points using up to three or four lancets across this entire body area with our cauterization tool (presumably a type of scalpel).
If the number of cauteriums (cauterizing instruments) required is determined by you, then treat that area without pressing your hand too much on the instrument beforehand; do this only for sending out the urethral discharge.
If pain enters into both shoulders, then apply the treatment as previously mentioned in this chapter.
If the pains are only in the limbs alone, and it is called sourness, then a point is made along the circuits of the hotbeds, pierced through those two lines.
If there are residual pains in the joints, then points shall be made along the circumscription of each focus on every bone and around the navel point.
If joint or muscle pain comes upon the hips or thighs on certain days, then doctors will perform cautery all over the body of their helpers.
And if there is bad humidity from improper diet and medicine intake, provided that a good regimen has been used with this treatment, God helps.

Use caution for large wounds requiring considerable healing efforts; and minimal if the species of leprosy is caused by decay from dampness and melancholy.
So when you intend to cauterize that one, consider whether the leprosy is present and has not spread further since our division here, nor this, and be wary of rot affecting all parts of the body and its complexity; then burn it on the head at the nape where we have already applied a treatment: above the forehead hairline (or bangs), below both eyebrows within two paces from each other's eyes; behind one, over the crown or servant positioned therein.
And lastly place the lancet inside until it penetrates into the bone slightly, and move them so that their scrapings are dislocated from there, allowing thick vapors to escape; then cauterize over the wound as you have prescribed.
If leprosy has already spread over the thigh and appears manifestly, then cover what you are cauterizing with those instruments that we have in our chests; apply them to the extremity of the nose, two on each kneecap, two on both cervical spines (the neck bones), one large for the joints closest to the thigh, another over the shoulder blade area, two above ankles and a cauterizing instrument for any footjoint; cover all these junctures of limbs and feet with them.
Guard your nerves which are above the ankle so they do not burn them off.
Some caustic is applied on the bone of the jaw and another over the mouth of the stomach, and yet another to the genitals.

They also examine the wounds carefully that have been previously seared here in this place; I wonder if blood was not seen before, fearing it might be an ulceration (a sore or open lesion), and yes, there were indeed some traces of bleeding observed. This indicates they are checking for signs of complications such as internal wounds that may have been previously cauterized but now show symptoms like active bleeding which could signify further damage beneath the skin's surface—something medieval doctors might suspect in a patient with past surgeries or interventions.

When any pus is delayed in its formation, and as such excess flesh appears therefrom or due to the state of the humors (bodily fluids), or because it has aged too long without proper nourishment ("few meals"), or simply by time's passage—it becomes necessary to expedite the maturation process; thus cauterization is applied within this circuit where small points are made with a sharp instrument. Once thereafter, that which was once ill-nourished will then find sustenance in its final stage of healing (maturation).

When humors become acidic within the body's veins—those beneath the skin of one’thy head (which may indicate an issue with circulation or a blockage), and in no way does any current medical intervention alleviate this, then your malady takes on the appearance similar to that of scurrying insects moving across their face while they walk; the humors are exacerbated as if distilled into tears. The skilled healers (or apothecaries) take these measures in treatment:
You command the malady wind to pull out the hairs on their face and you shall incise three grooves in the forehead according to the length of the forehead. If the length of the fissure is two fingers: one crack extends to the length of the nose in the forehead position (at the frontal bone), and the second according to a small movement of the eyes (lacrimal gland), which are three parts apart.

When catharsis arrives and continues, the humors expand within them, leading to their observation by doctors who then tend to their irritated palpebrae (eyelids) with care as well as their hairs which may have been affected possibly due to an excess of these same disordered fluids. During this initial stage under control, there is a sharp and agonizing pain described in the head—this indicates that at times such intense physical symptoms are manifestations (accidents) caused by disturban0172;the flows or 'veins' coming from broken parts of their being as suggested. These occurrences demonstrate to wise ones how these situations, which bring about catharsis and healing through addressing the fractured components—these are not random but originate directly from certain disrupted vessels within those fragments.
And the best cure in these is that you command the malady to raise its front, and for this purpose carve a small fissure at the forehead spot of the face; then incision shall be inside the bone, within which it enters (and thus make an opening from the right temple'thy inner side into the left one; therein said incisions should go into the bone itself), until its os is uncovered.
Remove all phlegm or dampness from the sancus (body), and restore what has been removed between the lips of the chasm in the joints or on clothes, which belongs to them. When above at the top of the belly there is poultice, it prevents further inflammation or abscess formation (apostema).
When the poultice has absorbed water and begun to dry out on its surface (on your body), then when it becomes hard enough that begins breaking down flesh, at this point care for what is left behind after removing bits of bread made from wheat flour in two parts and honeycomb pieces in four parts. Mix them together with the poultice material you've applied on these wounds (these sores), apply it again to your body wherein flesh naturally occurs, as when taking down portions of wheat flour bread mixed with honey for treatment.

So then if there appears any cause by worms here, extract them gently or with subtle movements; and if no such cause is found, take a swiftly drawn canula from below (which this becomes): And insert the subtle part into the armpit according to the quantity that suffering can cause harm; and use suction there with great force, making continuous movements until all worms are expelled from their holes.
May you not disobey the doctor's advice, then you will bleed and close off in the circuit of the catheter inserted with wax as we have discussed; administer these remedies which have already been tried against old ailments within their treatment courses.

So it is when one enters into the cavity of this continence chamber here that there is necessity for them. If you wish, take the wand and wrap it around their decent limb gently, and place oil or some other liquid from these medicines in the cavity of the chest (which is located on your finger), so that this be placed below where the breath comes out at the same time as applying pressure with your hand above to expel the applied compress.

It emphasizes careful handling—not only removing but also understanding what caused loss ('roots' or 'reasons') for proper treatment and mindful placement back if possible (implied by "separates these fragments").
If there is a flow of pain coming from within," the line suggests using subtle caution (cultural understanding) to treat those affected areas with small-scale intervention ('small burns'). This could imply moderate and precise use of heat or other gentle methods in medical practice during this era.

Thus extract those clothes which you have wrapped around the limbs on both sides and turn them between the right and left hand, so that it may be opened up.
When you make sure that it does not pass through the crack, thus preventing the spine and ribs from protruding into this area, guard yourself accordingly.
May you not see the patient's artery in the fissure, may you insert there easily into that vessel; and adjust its position where we have discussed it before; lift those drapes above them with your hands dipped in water to pause over the location and dress these small pills.
So that when salt and rest are applied in the cavity of the crack, what remains from this moisture can be removed.

When the hairs of our eyes are adjusted quickly, naturally and anciently by ourselves (the act), we become ill with watery ways that accompany tearing up and irritation within where this is caused from touching or rubbing one's eye; cured in four methods: either through focusing a needle point for the treatment of wounds as mentioned later on, according to "The Capitol" concerning surgical procedures (which implies various types of interventions); by pulling out and manipulating hair roots with fine instruments—in this context possibly using forceps; or perhaps involving tweezers.
And so that you close the mouth of the malady in its throat; take hold of your left eye's lid with your right hand (if it has already been converted), and if not then insert a needle into where parted flesh from undernethy, pushing gently. The point enters through what is beneath—the eyelashes or fur—and thus becomes the bridge; pull back the pointed end to these places above its location in the eye's lid (where hair grows), and convert it therein as a cure for this illness.
Here is the line-by extricated translation:
Even though the figure is determined by the extent of eye opening, among men this has already been diversified; those who have a large amount in their eyes are treated with medicines that were inscribed into the eyelid to soften it as much as possible according to its capacity.

From the sentence provided, it appears to be discussing an ophthalmic procedure where something is being extracted from below the lower eyelid ("desus" can be understood as "below").
When the foreign body or piece is in either right (dextra) or left part of lower lid contraction ("es contraccio"), it's due to poor fixation of graft or segment or cauterization, and this condition calls for intervention using a lancet. This occurs naturally as consolidation after the placement of a graft/segment/cauterized material (plagues) or from their misplacement; it is addressed by intervening with precision tools aimed at restoring proper position – here, possibly involving extraction and repositioning procedures for any displaced elements.
May the reason for this operation be that you cut through that solidification and separate the lips of him/her here in which water is between them (possibly referring to a body cavity), and bind those inside until they are healed.

As for the method of operation it is that you grasp an instrument in which a double-edged tool lies and keep one edge on the flesh while forcing another through the right tear gland into the left, whereby the point reaches down to touching both extremities (ends) of the body." This line describes what appears to be a surgical technique from historical medical texts involving puncturing or cutting with tools near the eyes and tears. The reference is likely outdated for modern medicine but could relate historically to procedures around eye care, specifically targeted at conditions related to tear ducts (lacrimals). It should be noted that direct translation of such specific terminology may require further context from medical history or a specialist in the language and period-specific dialect.
In translating this line by line from what appears to be an archaic or historical form of Latin influenced by Italian and Spanish (or medieval medical texts), the translation would go as follows: And if you return the figure of the eyelid as it was covered; otherwise take a stick and pause there in the divided figure, then bend that part over to turn back the eyelid, and open those cracks in the skin of the eyelid immediately.
When the extremities of the diseased joints are their cracks at two angles of the incision, and it is within these where they occur together that form their figure or shape as affected by disease.

Adjust the separated parts and fix those with wool thread as directed, paying attention to what has been mentioned in ointments soothing (molliphilic substances) or poultices within which they should heal.

The phrase suggests a method
If treating a crack or requiring stitching and caustic application is necessary for the eyelid'sincisions, then cut as needed across the skin of the eyelid according to what has come before (presumably referring back to earlier instructions on procedure). Here 'alxacrati endeve' seems akin to an incision in modern terms; 'es precedit' translates directly into English as "as was previously done." The context suggests that this line would follow the initial steps of treatment, Separate within the poultice between both lips according to what has been directed (suggesting placement or separation in preparation for healing). Here, 'separar' means "to separate" and is

When in the nose various kinds of meat are inserted for which there is no cause leading to scorpion sickness or polyps, this illness is called 'polyp,' similar to that beetle represented." This passage appears to discuss a medical condition related to nasal issues. It mentions inserting different types of meats into the nose without an apparent reason and links such action with symptoms resembling scorpion sickness or polyps, which are abnormal growths in the membranes lining the nose (polyps) often associated with irritation caused by foreign bodies like meat. This line seems to convey a belief that inserting meats into the nasal cavity could be harmful and might lead to conditions li And from it meat turns black or dark brownish in color therein (the nose), and that is why the flesh of this matter is not a reddish yellow as natural."

The practitioner is advised to elevate or position (raise) what are likely internal objects within by applying pressure in specific areas—between legs and over certain parts presumably related directly through touch, possibly the belly area where they mention "tio onci" which may be an obsolepective term for a spoon.

The reference indicates these motions are perforated ("per foracio") or dissected ('secio'), which may be a part of an observational practice. Furthermore, it points out that one aspect could involve the actual insertion into specific regions—pot
The sentence in question seems to be detailing two specific types of "apostomata." The first type is likely positioned within the head, distinct from those present by mistake at the chin ("acidente en le cap"). In contrast, it discusses an instance where a mass-like structure ('apostema') happens in fleshly (corporeal) locations rather than joints—again differentiating this bodily occurrence. Importantly, these are described as instruments for operation or surgical purposes ("juguament per operacio"), suggesting their relevance to clinical procedures within the context provided by your fragmented Latin-inspired text. To render a full and accurate translation would require additional information surrounding each term's usage in its original source material, which appears rooted deeply in
May there be some instruments that are not pierced but appropriate healing for the disease in those parts of them, or as an adjunct to their care.
So other appliances that are torn when crossed and do not mature according to their complement, similar to those applied at joints where a tear occurs upon crossing; the cause is stretching of ligaments or nerves in that joint due to fluid circulating within it until they ripen. If you delay this puncture beyond its ripe state towards the main limb, then pierce into that unripe part which will bleed and swell at the bone fragments; if not done properly where one crosses over (i.e., in the area of a hernia), it results incomplete digestion therein with continued leakage from below causing elongation to the sections downstream of this defect, resulting either as an abscess or fistula that will not heal within the body itself. May you know when the puncture of the abscess is due and then it comes time for it to heal.
E understand that it matures when the pain subsides and fever ceases, and reduce the decrease of speech and heartbeat, and strengthen the head of abscess formation, as well as other symptoms.
And when you know that there has been a breach in the place where discharge and healing secretions have appeared, it is time to act for treatment or intervention.
Through piercing or puncturing deep into the flesh of the body or limbs, if the apendices are in muscle parts or feet joints and entrails such as abdominal cavity (or intestines), nerve plexuses, ligaments; and even deeper than these reflective places where light does not return, using piercing according to each affected body part.
May it be when the abscess is in the fleshly part, then we must perform its incision within which can confirm digestion according to their second complementary period; if you pierce that area at this time, it prolongs the patient'se groin and buttocks (implying these areas become sore), hardens their lips/mouth cavity, and increases its depth.
May an apsteroid be pushed through according to the flesh's or body'dictorial need, or as needed by that member itself.
When you administer a small puncture, and for large or wide incisions, cut segments according to the size of the apasts.
Other tools that are used when the cecum is opened and inflamed with pain from bread consumption or bloating (similar to discomified stones of bladder and boils), then apply those same instruments similarly as you have applied them here for this condition.
From those who have three joints seated within a section (limb), and among these are where it is situated similar to the form of an arrowhead from mistletoe, or like the appendages of arthritis.

May that one who cannot bear shall stand as if they had surface lion claws pricked only on the spot where you pierce them; for such a person can barely endure any deeper injury or puncture beyond this point.
When the abscess is large and has collected pus already, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; remove some from that area today, place more in there tomorrow by increasing amounts according to healing progression until fully resolved within a few days or up to several weeks.
Mostly if the malady is caused by excessive bile or liver disease in men, elder women, young girls, or weakened individuals—for their spirits move towards expulsion and thus they die from the illness, then you intervene with treatment.
1. Watch this chapter with great care, and place your incisions where you pierce these thorns; be wary that you do not catch diseases, and consider whether the pus from the thorn is scant or a flat layer, then attend to what he/it prescribes for it – if the thorn is large and there are fissures in your incision site, cover these areas with linen where we meet.
If in the apoplectic there has been detachment of part of the colon or that area has concave within its circuit, then you should bind it with wool thread or linen fabric as soon as possible when holding pans or sponges moistened by sweat; and tightly secure it for three days. After this time, process and cure what comes out of the bandages that have been in place during healing.
If you harden the flow of phlegm in the hour of your operation, then administer warm water and apply them with which cloth(s) you have provided for this purpose; pause over the location where the phlegm flows persistently.
May the flow of blood persist if you maintain your regimen and care with these powders recommended here in our current book and division.
If it is winter time and the place of abscessation is where nerves are tender, then cover them with powder made from herbs and oil, applying these over those locations.
If it is summer and the locations are carnivorous, then when you pause pills at the beginning of the day with water and oil, as we have mentioned before, this allows all that enters to enter until the freshest part of the day; furthermore, when you remove the abscess and cleanse away whatever has entered therein, tend it in accordance with what is necessary for its healing.

Here come those who are suffering in the neck and where these pains originate between them, their own tunic is affected by it all, even at the nodes and scrofulous lumps of themselves; we treat as they have when among nodules and swellings on the head.
Those spices in these scrophulas are motions; some of them are stones, and those that contain moisture within, and those which are harmful without treatment.

This translates to: "May in men also have an inclination not to extract the phlebotomy (a procedure that was performed using leeches, commonly done for bloodletting), which if avoided here means they will neither receive proper care nor circulate well through all their veins and major arteries." Here it appears as though a writer is discussing an alternative or avoidance of common medical practices like phlebotomy that were supposed to help with the health issues related to venous blood flow. This reflects how medieval medicine often involved various treatments, some based on humoral theories

Certainly, here is the line translated into English with an attempt to maintain a sense of context: During treatment or healing
The eminence of the navel can be painful due to various causes: it could result from cracks in the diaphragm above which lies within our bodies; or as a consequence following other ruptures where leeches might flow, such as veins and arteries after they have burst. Alternatively, this discomfort may arise because of constriction that tightens around us when winds are pressured down into the body from above—or perhaps due to contractions compressing within our bodies themselves which can happen internally or externally in places where there's already a rupture present.
If there is a crack in the chest and discharge from the membrane, then the color of the ulceration resembles that of the body (possibly red), and it causes pain like that of a lion; appearing under various circumstances. If it is an escape of the intestine, then recall what we have noted about that which has come out, its intense diversity may vary greatly; and if you perceive this amount to be large, return it inside (the body); immediately afterward, immerse him in bath water vigorously.
If due to moisture, it is like a lion and will not disappear until you place your hand upon it; nor does it tighten or grow as its size increases.
If it is for sanction, then you appear the black decay descending on these joints.

If it is due to airiness/wind-like condition, then touching him will be like a lion.

Then thrust the abscess deep in four parts through these inserted needles to penetrate it thoroughly:
If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them where it will suffice; when they are delicately inserted and pierced through, take care that what is inside those used for bandaging enters there as well, helping heal the extended flesh.
If the navel of the patient is made entirely or partially fleshless due to moisture, you must treat it with water applied and extracted therefrom, which in turn dries up within them; also care for that same wetness by applying and extracting whatsodictates (medicinal applications), thereby consolidating its location.

The translation into English for this portion is as follows: And from that one (the condition), detach it gently and withdraw the other entirely within its cavity; place upon there a layer of Egyptian linen, which will submerge in oil daily until healed ("cura diafinicon"). This sentence describes an ancient medical practice whereby specific treatments were employed for conditions affecting males' reproductive organs. The use of "Egyptian linen" suggests the application of a poultice or compress to facilitate absorption and potentially deliver medicinal properties through oil, aimed at promoting healing ("sicat sanitat").

From the refinement and care for those who undergo circumcision in these matters, it follows:
Circumcision is not cure for continuity of diseases: but perhaps when it comes from our operation and desire, and in children particularly, we must assign them to the better healing way with gentle means.
So they say that ancient times did not practice castration among free men, nor do so in their laws, and only when they acquired it through experience – which is why most of the artisans and barbarians resort to circumcision with new razors and knives; using leather straps for securement and a scalpel for incision.

The translated phrase from the medieval medical treatise, focusing on "Curacio de urina retenguda in vesiculis," would be:
The translated phrase reads as follows: The retention of urine in the bladder is a fault caused by humoral excess due to blockages from stones, tumors or hardness within its walls; and they seem similar to those treated with remedies for bedsores during division. Herein lies an excerpt that suggests medieval physicians recognized conditions such as urinary retention could be influenced by the accumulation of harmful substances (representing 'humoral excess') in various ways—through physical obstructions like stones, growths or toughness within the bladder walls. The subsequent mention aligns with treatments for bedsores ("manieyras de curacio"), which historically were used
If there is no dissolution of the fluid we have discussed and it vehemently causes pain on the waist, then take action with an instrument you call a syringe for extraction; this tool has two forms: one made of silver that is subtle like a small lion conqueror, another using quills from dove'dictone feathers which are delicate and long as fingers or middle finger.

When there is ulceration or abscess in the bladder area, or when it becomes sclerosed and constricted, you must extract waters and medicines from that place using the instrument to which you have clamped. This is how one carries out this procedure:
sino cuando fuera extra medio (outside), there it is mute or closed off. And in that way three troubles arise from one division, which occurs sometimes.
In the place of consumption (the surgical field), where it is drawn in and its second quantity that ascends from there, upon any cause drawing to this amount being pulled out or expelled; when removed long enough until a clamp captures which then exudes naphtha during sea battles.

Return (or place back) the limb'supremacy into its cavity, ensuring that it does not protrude outwards from within the body space or 'cavity'.
Then place your hand over the bladder to prevent urine leakage from within the cavity where that moisture (humors) has already penetrated, likely indicating excessive fluid accumulation or imbalance causing discomfort in this region of the body during a medical examination. Note: This interpretation is based on medieval medicine concepts related to humoral theory and bladder function which may not align perfectly with modern anatomical understanding but attempts at translation given historical contextual clues from
If there is no bladder present (implied as the physician takes a sponge from paragliding and makes contact with that circle; piercing through its entirety), then firmly place it into those disrudictions, stopping where you wish to cause movement within these areas.

From stone. (Note: The Latin phrase "de extractione pedis" literally translates
We already have them divided into the species of stone and care for it with medicine, and we understand those symptoms related to that which comes from urine stones versus bladder stones (assuming "specias" refers to types or forms, possibly a mistranslation). The phrase attempts to describe two different conditions caused by varying origins—urinary and perhaps non-urological sources for the stone formation ("peira").
In the stone where operation takes place, and a section is involved.
The translated text line by line is as follows:
Here he describes that which has been exposed and abbreviated outwardly.
So it is said that stone formed mainly in the bladder comes out through children; and from his kidneys, urine excreted by the body resembles water in its subtlety, appears therein [i.e., inside]; stones flare up within their flank (the side of the abdomen), painful movements occur at times herein, it is then dressed and for his anus a hole made to let out these pains with such tools as are available among them nowhere else in this realm; he goes through.
It is laborious treatment for those children within that have reached fourteen years, and difficult care in the limbs. When in young people they migrate due to these (fluids/humors),
From that which the stone is larger and where poultice has been placed more gently; if it is little, contrary to what was previously mentioned.
So when approaching the treatment of that, bring it together with what is inside its chest cavity where it exits through all those holes which are within your belly buttons; there some periods may have prohibited to prevent any blockage from occurring and thus hindering further inquiry.
Return its position to the hips and thighs for it to descend into the bladder of the womb or spring from place occasionally due to some movements.
And apply that cauterizing instrument among your prepared ones, and let the more of them be at hand for you now, so that the bladder as a whole may descend into divisions immediately.
Return that which is lacking from both sides. (Here "aprop" means return or restore; "perquier" indicates seeking what'thy lacks
So if you feel the pinch in space, then touch it with your hand immediately over there. (In this sentence "peira" can refer to a type of discomfort or pain; "espazi" means spaceship or area within an enclosed environment like on Earth; and "coytar
If you do not fix your touch within a short time, then apply oil as indicated on the left side if it's an infant (infants often require soothing with specific oils), or use moisturizing cream for those who are fully grown and place that directly onto one’s belly. This suggests remedial action to be taken depending upon whether a child is present, using different products tailored according to age which aligns historically with medieval medical practice's approach of individualized treatment based on symptoms and the patient's characteristics (age in this case). Through a channel in which urine was supposedly staying inside of it came forth that fluid from the bladder. When that small one turns into something within the bladder's neck (the ureter), it becomes part of the body, held in place by your hand which you hold on
Place pressure upon that thing above the bladder's neck (the ureter), and expel it from those parts beyond where you insert your catheter, which is used to empty the bladder contents. This instruction suggests a medical procedure for irrigating or flushing out residual urine in patients with difficulty voiding by inserting a t
Commands the minister to press upon the bladder with his hand; and commands another minister to extend their right arm over those parts below them (likely referring to areas around or underneath a patient), while also instructing that other minister's left hand should retract the catheter, which is used during this procedure. This directive indicates an older medical practice where manual manipulation of instruments was often required for bladder irrigation procedures before modern catheters and mechanical assistance were available. Here we have a situation likely involving multiple caregivers working together to facilitate urination or the drainage process in patients with impaized voiding ability, perhaps due to neurological damage (evident by references such as "genetius" which might be shorthand for 'catheter' and relates
Place pressure upon the end of that instrument, where it enters or has entered—possibly referring to an indwelling catheter which is inserted into and retained within the bladder for continuous drainage. This line Divides it into that which enters and those parts (the catheter segments), not in the middle where urine exits but above at the knee of your left leg; with each segment being placed over there, forming a cross shape for wider drainage according to how much is needed from underneath thigh area—and ensuring that it remains securely held within place by means such as tape or bandages applied directly on top where catheter and pad are positioned. This detailed directive instructs healthcare providers in the steps for properly managing an indwelling urinary catheter, including securing its position to prevent accidental displacement while ensuring adeoption of aseptic technique is emphasized ("no major" suggesting minimalistic intervention). It underscores careful measurement and application techniques necessary when handling urological instruments.
E understand that from stone there is some area where the head and edges meet, making it difficult to cleanse out of water.
From that fluid it appears like a lion and is round, made of the liver'se secretions for purification.
Thus if it is that which you have angled or margined, adjust in the crack.
If there is not a hole for drainage (forum-getada), then you must create one over that area or where pressure points are being applied, with the tip of your catheter placed on the skin directly above it; do not avoid going into this place; immediately introduce a slender instrument to curve the extremity.
If you cannot cover it there (the affected area), then increase the wound slightly and if you see a flow of blood, cut away that portion which has been treated with sulfur triple distilled vinegar.
If the stone is within one of them (referring to bladder or kidney), then lead it down into their mouth, and place your hand over it there; also carry a small quantity with you; they seem like pains caused by diseases.
If you find blood in great quantity, it is due to your ignorance that you have introduced this large portion into the malady; either because it remains or comes from continuous urine distillation, thus not having completely secured its location therein.
May administer the extraction of it within which it has gone out (likely referring to a foreign object in an injury), or if there's a break, let instruments be inside where they extract that very same thing from its places (places). Here 'it' likely refers to whatever is causing pain or discomfort.
Therefore, once you have completed your operation, fill the patient' extraneous humors with aloe and dragonwort sap, and strengthen them. Pause over that linen steeped in oil and vinegar or water-rubbed with wine, so that the applied poultice softens its hardening.
Return the belly of the patient over his/her backbone, and do not pull on the ligament inside until tomorrow.
When that air has flown away, apply water and oil here, taking care to keep them moistened inside until they heal.
May if you cauterize an abscess that is softened and decayed, like when the patient's bladder appears frozen (and urine is forbidden from exiting through it), then insert a tube into the pus-filled area and remove that sore.
And apply the poultice with water and salt herein contained within it or elsewhere where needed for healing inside as long as they are cured therewith.
In those hours of total care when you attend both hips and adjust the medicines which are applied on that spot.
If the stone is small and located in the bladder, where it remains therein, then urination of this water (stone) is prohibited. Hereafter healing occurs through these measures taken to prevent ascension towards the next section; already have obtained some fluid, so now take hold of a steel needle for puncture here:
From outside of the womb, gout is lodged in a cane (or walking stick).
Once bound firmly (loin), and it is placed there by their hand for that they may not return to the bladder again.
And insert the iron into the wound quickly so that when it is withdragyed by the puncture maker to this stone, they can proceed. And rotate the probe in your hand within that small stone gradually, and insert it into one of those parts until another from a different area enters therein—then the urine is expelled immediately.
Return your hand over the fluid that is rising from the broken stone below, where it has been cracked, and acts as a drainage place for urine; therein lies the cure for urethritis.
If this treatment is not within your means due to any reason that prevents you from it, then take a piece of wax immediately on the stone and another undernethy legs; thus holding their hands as well. Translation line by line: Return that outwardly (or) remove it externally. Return the ligaments and cleanse the sanctioned joints in the soil where they are located; these things you do herewith:
No it is not necessary to use hemp thread immediately after the piercing of the bladder, but only when needed; and another lashing above unless once the hemp has been removed from beneath the patient' extrication site, then the catheter returns to its place and recovers itself.
When it is necessary for you to lift the leg undernethy (assuming this refers to lifting the lower limb), then raise your belt upwards towards their parts below or when you must return, bring back what was previously given by us here.

Rocks in the womb produced little or not at all – this translation appears nonsensical because "peyra" is a term that doesn't
If there are any of those rocks present, it is difficult to heal and is forbidden for passionate individuals – this translation suggests that encountering some physical conditions (possibly stones or irregularities) within the womb poses a challenge in treatment and may be considered off-limits by someone with strong emotions. The context seems rooted in historical medical understanding, where treatments were often constrained
One of them is the woman who has her limits reached – this translation indicates that there's a particular case involving women whose conditions have been brought to their extremes or boundaries,
The second one is either you can't find a woman who removes it with the doctor when she goes out (perhaps referring to removing obstetric stones or complications), or they are of female descent – this translation implies that there might be women whose birth conditions predispose them to certain health issues, making treatment without medical intervention difficult. The passage discusses scenarios where direct action by a woman is not sufficient for addressing

The fourth one is that the location of her body stone above (possibly indicating a retained or misplaced fetal remnant) extends beyond its actual site, making it prudent to perform an evacuation – this translation refers to situations where there might be leftover tissue from pregnancy within the patient's womb that is not in its original position. The mention of "prudency" suggests a cautious approach when considering removal due to potential complications._TRANSLATE
If it is necessary to induce urination (to expel the excess fluid), then take hold of a woman' extricated physician figure and gently press on her back - if she does not resist much pressure can be applied.

When you prepare the instruments which are used for extracting bone from humans, so that your help may be useful in this operation of yours.
If you see a flow of blood and know that its expulsion is due to black bile (which the physician recognizes as obscure), then pause there with powder on the spot and gently press and release tension, without further action; loosen the stone but do not remove it, for this will lead to death from illness. Return care for the creature/beast. (In this context, it likely refers to
So when the sharpness of sanction fades with each passing day, it loosens its grip on me, and thus I return to my work as soon as the stone is removed/lifted off. (Here "la peyra" likely refers to a punishment or restraint that has been imposed; removing this metapsychological burden allows one'thy creative process—or personal growth in another interpretation—to resume.)
This appears to be referencing Roman legal texts, with "Capitol LX
From the section concerning hernia (presumably an excerpt from medical or judicial literature discussing
This is an interpretation of a line from what seems to be discussing the medical condition hernia in ancient Roman context: "Herniation then isn't just excess moisture within white membrane where intestines containing humors are housed, and it’s referred to as 'the cushion.'" (Here “ciphac” likely refers to a kind of bandage or protective covering used in ancient medicine. "Humor," in this case related to body fluids
Here some remedies are applied to the pancreas (“le propri pannicol”) within its part where it produces humors in accordance with what we have said about this organ previously; and these treatments lie between 'the white covering' under which our previous discussion took place, but they aren’t just other fluids – rather, the pancreas is essentially toughened or hardened. (The term "cuyat que ja es otro humor" suggests that certain remedies contain a different humor—possibly bile from where excess moisture has accumulated; and 'the codena del genetiu' refers to what seems like some form of protective covering
The generation of this hernia is due to debility which reaches the kidne extrication so that these things are expelled from those individuals and some even by striking pain upon their kidneys.
This moisture has motions of colors; whether it turns red like blood or yellow like lemonade, black as tar or white as milk, that is what we most desire to know about it.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And for these joints where it has been added water as we have mentioned hereinabove, when it is applied within a short time in the shape of steam (humor), and appears on the face, then healing begins after declining an apothecary'dictum over several hours.
If moisture is present in the patient's pancreas (Note: "pancreas" might be an error here as it was not mentioned earlier, and medieval texts often used imprecise terminology), then leave amputation at that part of the body, and so he esteems another organ.
If the moisture is between the chin and the tongue white (referring perhaps to a whitish coating on the tongue), then touch it gently with one' extrication tool or another instrument placed there, holding their hands as needed for gentle guidance during this procedure.
When you wish to gain knowledge of the color of humidity, look at the discoloration that precedes its onset; and as soon as it appears in the mark where it entered, examine the liquid from which it came.
So when we come to treat him with iron for his feverish phlegm that is within your reach, then take turns applying pressure on the patient' extrices (fever). Sometimes apply compressions directly onto their body.
And he places himself on his two shoulders for some cause or other and quickly folds the cloths.
Put it on the left side of them, and command their minister to follow the right side of them, extending his staff from two hands down to between the chin and jawline as well as below the waist'dictum (the part where belly meets the back). Here is a line-by-line translation:
And place precious silver and divide the neckbone of the patient within herein for their extended period,
And when pain occurs in the second section distanced from the pubic line that should be kept straight by the penis, it reaches the white circle containing the bladder and thus concludes its pathway.
Excise that, and watch carefully so you don't re-injure it; your excision should be limited to the least necessary part of what has been lifted away, which is observed with close attention according to how much can possibly be removed safely.
When one pierces through the bladder of water with a wide puncture and removes all the water,
Here is the line-by-line translation: When it enters therein and mainly under the skin, unless you examine its nature precisely, one cannot be certain that water will not return.
If the procedure of that area beyond your cushion in the time of your operation takes place, when you have completed the stitching part of the suture on the groin'mates', then return it there and adjust the lips of their wombs sewn together by oneself (the surgeon), with care as if they were other creatures within so that heals.
If you have corrupted the humors through another illness, then take away what causes suffering for them and extract that which we mentioned earlier; give special care to it as directed hereinabove.
May if water is added to any of the parts examined, then you will understand that those are hernias; therefore, incise in that part which has been cut on another limb; and if it'dicts an operation for you, perform it immediately.
Return the intestine or hernia to its cavity. Place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from protruding. Submerge this wool in oil or rosemary-infused oil, and spread it on two lozenges made of dough (belly rounds), placing them inside the abdomen; pause between these pieces with folded and pulverized linen sheets, then bind everything together using hemp twine according to this form.
And lay two drapes with woolen fringes according to this manner; they will be straps around the extremities which are kept together or soaked in wet wool, and these bandages extend along the waistband of their petticoats, one strap encompveeing the patient'se middle thigh while another surrounds the part between her legs. All extrication is arranged within the skirts’s waistbands.
And some times this hernia is treated artificially with pointed caulcer in its place of excision by iron; and you hold a delicate cauldron undernethy's belly button, until it reveals the clear bladder containing water within. And then you apply cauterization as follows: and it is assembled in Greek letters.
When it is necessary to pierce that cavity therein, and whereby all the moisture gets expelled outwardly.
Here are the line-by extralined translations:
Be aware that this operation is saving and extending life span, better than mere cauterization with a lancet (or small knife).
May it happen that you create an antiseptic application on the wound during dressing or bandaging time, if there's bleeding (or discharge of pus), then cover what needs to be treated as per which is said hereinabove.
May the hump be afraid (of further operations due to its horror), and perform a puncture as you are advised by water; when confirmed that we have discussed the meanings previously mentioned, it will become clear that this hernia is already swollen/inflamed.
When you make an incision in the maul over any raised knee joint (ankle), pierce through the abscess at its lower part on the shin bone and stop the puncture according to the length of the wound.
When I have made a wide opening for water flow throughout (the body).
Return your pace over the place where it is bound and bind that which has come here, in order for the body fluid to flow back into its course. Return that which is inside so it may be healed (or cured).
May it be that contrary water is at the source of this in that hour when you perforate: and it's not pain but freshwater within the marsh dwellers causes opposition, preventing any treatment with water from being administered; or adjust a small one to their presence.
Be aware that water returns and is collected for up to several months or until the humidity has passed; when it accumulators as per that physician's methodology, then lochia (postpartum discharge) will flow through accordingly over those days.

The arrival of this hernia occurs through a section that extends over the abdomen's walls as if there was an opening in these sacks by which the bulges reach out towards it, whereby they can protrude from those openings during contraction or tension. This description reflects medieval understandings of what might happen with hernias and suggests a belief that internal organs could be affected significantly enough to manifest as an external physical anomaly when pressured internally—consistent with the humoral theory prevalent in medicine at the time, where imbalances among bodily fluids were thought responsible
This rupture is either of the sac or due to excretion from it; these ailments are caused by: blows (percussion), bites and stings (bite/sting injuries), loud noise exposure, heavy loads lifted improperly (lifting too much weight inaccurately) as well as other severe reasons or mere appearances. Here the text attempts to explain how a hernia could be caused by various factors such as physical impacts like punches ("blow"), animal attacks—both biting and stinging, loud sounds that may induce shock-like effects on tissues possibly leading to rupture of some membranal structures involved in
The fluid (aqueous), when the sac stretches far and wide due to exertion of force on it, rarely gets infected for a long time; instead, this can cause inflammation inside our mouth leading into the chest wherein such an occurrence is referred within these walls as being bound together by that fluid which has entered deep in those areas. The medieval text here speaks about how body fluids could play roles not just internally but also externally causing physical symptoms, illustrating a rudimentary understanding of possible consequences when the protective membrane stretsetup is compromised through exertion or injury—a concept that might relate to current medical understandings

Translation: Of castration in our law it is excommunicated; nevertheless I remember this herein for reasons which are within my purview—one being that when we discuss the matter with a doctor during his treatment, he should recall how to cure such cases as these. Moreover, if there's an urgent need to employ castration of other animals (whether horses, oxen, pigs or beasts) for our own benefit in their movements—as is also done when using saddles and harnesses—these actions are permissible even under ecclesiastical law.
And so it is said that castration occurs in two ways: either through drawing away (atrissio), or by tearing apart the limb (fissura a seccio).

"The slowing down of bodily tissue is adjusted according to natural causes, and certain measures are magnified in women within which dissatisfaction spreads as if among men, even during intimate encounters." The sentence delves into the concept that there's a perceived link between female discontent (possibly related to lentigo) and its more pronounced manifestation or exacerbation influenced by natural causes. Additionally, it implies these conditions could intensify when women are with men or during sexual intimacy—a perspective possibly grounded in historical misconceptions about sex-related health issues from the time period of such a text's origin.

It appears that the text is written in Medieval Latin with influences from regional languages like Italian or French, making it somewhat understandable even for those who are not fully proficient in classical Latin. Here's an attempt to translate each line into English:

Here 'fustz' refers likely to metal objects like iron or lead used for medical purposes in medieval times, and This line translates into English as follows: It is pain at the extremity that requires two additional measures with each application; those lengths are a handbreadth (which roughly equates to about six inches), and these distances, which likely refers to space or placement for applying treatments such as cautery pads. Here 'additament' could be referring to supplemental remedies used alongside the main treatment, possibly medicinal poultices with certain materials (like iron/lead) applied at specific

If the mother's mouth is constricted (potentially indicating pain or limited mobility), we have already recommended cupping therapy and medical care for her throat inflammation with plant-based medicine, highlighting a tailored approach to address specific symptoms affecting this particular area of concern. This suggests that non-invasive methods like cupping are considered alongside traditional remedies using natural
Should not all the causes recommended be removed at once (implying that some issues may require gradual treatment), but if what is inside her mouth leads to female discomfort, then apply wax and pharmacopeia; this remedy must work over several days of application until it becomes dissolved/resolved. Here we see a nuanced approach in which immediate intervention with medications or substances (wax here) might be necessary for internal issues within the mouth impacting female health, suggesting that sometimes direct and possibly temporary measures are taken to alleviate symptoms while working towards their eventual relief through consistent application over time. This reflects a methodical treatment philosophy combining immediate care with gradual healing processes tailored specifically to this patient's needs based on gender-specific considerations mentioned within the medieval medical context of these instructions, which may account for differences in female anatomy or associated health concerns according to historical belief systems about women’s bodies.

When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or meat of the urethra, it means that this is where I must treat with urine from there to ensure that this location becomes medicine-consistent (or in simpler terms: "when a fistula enters the bladder or the meatus of the urethra, it indicates where treatment should be focused on expelling and containing urine for medical purposes").
May it enter the juncture of the thigh or into the bone and cause pain in circulation, then its name is that it attempts entry here if not through a narrowing within the bone, causing additional pain upon departure from this place; healing should occur quickly after applying poultices (immediate treatment), which are valueless both as an external covering or wax.

If that person feels chest oppression coming out of their bowels, immediately insert your finger into the area where they feel it to relieve pressure there.

Mayhap there have been cured those who were sick in bed among themselves.
From the medicine by which you hope, as before it was done, and in which you insert that flame with care into the canal of the fistula until it exits outside the cloister; then place therein again one or three times what has already been heated so all those bones adjusted to a fistula resembling a feather quill are well settled.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If it enters the anus and does not penetrate within there where things are digested (the rectum), between that which is expected to come out of meat or bile flow, and a fistula forms on its surface inside the colon, then dry up the colon' extrinsic part from the fistula area. And as you do so in the external portion of the tractus mentioned above where the extremity enters (fistula), it is released by that very thing itself therein dried out and captured within a catheter inserted into said location, thus liberated through drying and capture via internal device insertion.

The cause is to administer one of three remedies: or that which we have mentioned before; in order for you may enter the cavity and treat those things within it as needed so no intestine protrudes, preventing its escape from the abdomen - this concernment. And if necessary, tighten (or suture) such parts with what has been said earlier should they be strong enough; or elongate that membrane over which you have sewn and cleanse therefrom any pus accumulated inside due to infection – thus addressing the body's self-healing will. Or, alternatively (or using another sharp instrument of acute precision), suture those fistulas present within the tract where it may be possible for stitches; if leaking intestinal contents occur below that level through a hole in the buttocks or lower abdomen – seek immediate attention to heal. Thus complete restoration is made throughout (the entirety of) the affected body part, and should poultice applied externally not solidify within its place; it will break down instead - thereby resolving rupture fistulas formed in that area through an escape from the bowels below – attending to healing promptly. And sometimes the fistula is healed according to this methodology: when you insert a tool into the fistula, and it reaches the abdomen' extramarginally on the skin above the navel, taking care that inserted end of the instrument becomes perforated as if using surgical needles for treating wounds like these.
And insert into that faithful covering of the fields or enclose them, and attempt to insert into the flesh within the fistula where it continues its cavity;

May it be that the catheter of the fistula is not penetrating, then do so with whatever means you have prepared, but only if necessary because otherwise there will be no way to insert it; and apply immediately in whichsoever place shall heal.
The shape of the spine is what forms the fistula; its curve causes acute pain and the other division does not cause sharp pain, thus it's unnecessary to apply force when doing so sometimes.
Of the seam of hemorrhoids where blood flows in that part of it.

Return that care for it will be needed until they are healed.
If the belly does not obey expulsion, then crush it with pestles in which is bitten small and wash it with the water that exists in the colon where obstruction obeys to evacuation when the intestine squeezes.
If the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is humidity and dampness, and it'dicts that you grasp those with your finger or thumb (to press them inward), insertion of these into themselves, and apply care to ensure they heal as stated within.
And for those who avore their insufficiency, which is the second method according to this practice: take firm fabric and wrap it around that part where blisters have formed on top of them; insert one end into a needle and pull out these blistered areas with the thread from above, wrapping additional threads over what has been pulled away by the needle's sharp point. Secure tightly along its lengthwise direction; perform initial stitching where the wound is located atop that part covered in fabric, avoid using new threads for this purpose and remove the used ones with a single pull from above—this should be done longitudinally: first repair by suturing when dealing with such avulsion.
When it is needed for all of them (referring possibly to various medicinal preparations or elements), and not one from those should be consumed without proper care, thus allowing the excess fluid in that part (the body) to flow away from where it accumulisticly resides.
And place your hand over the abdomen, dipped in oil or chased with wine; and put it on top of the colon while commanding the humors to stop moving. And return that which is inside the box back in there when it' extricated (or freed), and take care of those within it who are healed or need another form of treatment kept at bay herein contained.
When they are aged and ineffective according to established medical practice of the time (translation considering medieval terminology), you should apply spatula points or your own lance inside where there are dry/wet wounds, which harbor pus beneath – thus preventing these from healing properly; accordingly, provide care for those that have become consolidated. Here is a more modern interpretation: When treatments no longer work and according to the traditional medicine of their time (medieval period), you should apply spatula points or your own lance inside where there are dry/wet ulcers underneward – preventing these from healing properly; accordingly, provide care for those that have formed scar tissue. This suggests using targeted measures like applying a pointed tool to address chronic wounds in hopes of better management and eventual recovery while taking into account the body's natural response mechanisms as understood during their time period (medieval era).
You should also take care of those where there is violent discharge that occurred at the beginning and are now open or have been scraped – thus providing proper healing for them as well (translation considering medieval medical terminology). Here's an interpretation in modern English: You must attend to wounds presenting with forceful pus exudation, which were initially fresh sores that may be raw and possibly abraded. The focus should then shift toward ensuring proper healing for these open lesions as well (
You understand that purple is the sign of life and its absence does not necessarily indicate death according to the color of one' extrinsic body (the clavicle), which occurs throughout the entire body primarily in the lower limbs and joints, so you must provide care for it.

Of treatment for diseases/illnesses.
You are already in the division of curing diseases according to their nature and your remedies following the principles laid out herein.
So it is said that swellings are diverse according to where they are formed and how deep the punctures of the pustules go.
E for the causes that bring on motion are pains caused by intestinal flatulence accompanying exertion of labor or sitting at a desk, or from percussion with hands or fist, or thrusts and impacts, resembling these movements' causes.
Mighty the humors that are present in the body'dict spaces also come up like vermin above the head (or on top), or neck, chest, belly, waist, and limbs; they resemble those of the members.
And when a recommendation is made for some diseases, in order that the pause or consideration of these other illnesses can be provided.
When you consume simple diseases from the head, as their memory will bring them to share at dinner with the third capital (head).
So it is said that when you experience simple headache without fracture and there's a swelling on the skull due to an abscess with cautery applied, then: if it is because of ear stones or appearance, then press your forehead only once so much, and note how large this plague is; as soon as possible extract from that part which corresponds in proportion to its vitality. Especially when the sick person mainly suffers due to skull worms, they are often few (in number).
When it is a flawbottomy of the opposite affected party, and you must protect the malady from overeating and heavy foods:
If any cause of meticulous examination is prevented, then it will be lessened in consumption and not brought close to meat or drink.
When pressure is applied over mud or water in which the patient has been immersed and where they are stuck (staphylococcus), apply heat with oil poultice or vinegar for treatment, if necessary cauterize appropriately using a heated pad.
If it is certain that the abscess has been drained by cautery and there's still fresh pus present, wait until their body and air have not changed this layer of dust which you recommended for dressing small wounds.
If the air has changed its quality, then rest on soft linens within which it is healed.
May it be if the child is large or through ignorance of space and appearance, and their lips are not properly adjusted for speaking, then adjust those with stitches as recommended by their surgical intervention.
May it be discovered that the child has exposed bone and penis but not restrained by you with anything except for a small carrier; then attend to that which is ill (the child), applying medicine as needed, repairing flesh back in its place of origin, and command the humors within these foods where there is swelling: heads of cabbage, forms similar to them, until it becomes compost.
If decay in the hipbone occurs and does not stick to the bone, then cut out all this putrefied matter with water and remove it carefully. Here is the translation line by line:
If in these diseases an artery or vein through which blood flows is not torn apart by medicine and remains intact, then you should examine the artery, and if it has been damaged but not completely severed, cut that very same part with a scalpel (or ligate), ensuring no further harm comes to this vessel. If what we have mentioned so far causes discomfort, perform cauterization where the blood vessel is already torn apart.
If these pains are simple and small, then their cause is a fever; so that you powder over those places until the air changes them.
The purpose of the powder is: a recipe with one part oil pressed from seeds, two parts dragon'dictone still not extinguished (meaning uncooked or raw), three parts mixed together; it shall be ground and sieved, this mixture filled in that adhesive container, then congealed using the same blood of drago.

When worms infest the colon, there is no difference in treatment for medicine (this line seems incomplete and may lack context), and between worms of the head when they are simple cases:
May the nerve of the colon or artery be inscribed or exposed if it is a nerve, not in that region for immediate treatment with quick puncture to avoid strong stitching intervention by water (referring here as healing fluid), similarly done like leeches and cupping used on their veins and against contraction of these vessels. No stops on any cause of total madness, for the substance of nerves is also fiery and its continuous flow to the brain causes it harm among all the body' extraneous parts.

May it be that in the ground there is an inserted artery and blood flow has been achieved; therefore separate or dry out/cauterize that which is necessary to induce fluid movement (to drain excess fluids).
May you have already fixed the vertebrae of the spine or all, and saved the veins in the neck, so long as your lips are sewn on the crest of the spine with suture without touching it; from above downward adjust that to its natural form, strengthen what is needed for proper alignment, leave it there through days at a time until healed. Carefully apply this dressage when inflammation and pain occur within so as they may recover.
May it occur that the child already has pain in their bones, and you will strike that area; if there are fragments of bone present as well, remove all those pieces which can be taken from them; but if this cannot happen to you, let water enter so that the child's skeleton becomes moistened, causing it to separate and freeing its flesh.
If the patient is recently ill, then sprinkle some powder over that which has been recommended for you. May it be that if there is an ulcer in the soil (referring to wounds or sores), then heal with water from which memory will return to his head.
If it is a sound of lance or cushion and at times you reach depth, then also consider that the wind from below ascends when the abdomen expands; know that the belly (wind) is mortal.
If there is no depth and the patient's humors are recent in their vessels, then you pause in the first hour after sunrthy cleaning, without stretching so that the sank does not remain deep within its vessel and return to the heart, which may alleviate pain by applying oil applied at this time of day.
If the ointment is not at hand, then pause in the bathroom where water can be found for that which quenches thirst of humors; and make sure gout (the condition) rests on the bedding so as to let flowing humor circulate.
May it already pass through the body for three days or more and will not worsen in the swelling of the malady, nor shaking of a bad heartbeat nor constriction of breath; then use other beneficial means available to you, so long as that patient is saved.
If the healing of Lu is allowed and it has been long enough since then, you will see that a fistula (a type of abnormal connection or passageway) has formed; therefore, attend to this with your own means/resources.
If the swelling is due to a wound or tear in space or skin and it's simple on the surface of the thigh or chest, then care for that with water used after suturing if large, or powder if small.
If there is pain in the bone and if those stones have become visible within it, then you must extract them with forceps (tongs), once they are separated from each other. May it not be separated, then have them taken out where they can easily be removed; this way the removal of those people is facilitated.
From other accidents affecting other body parts, their treatment is with the fluid we have mentioned before.
Of stomach diseases.
The discomgy or imbalance that you have in your belly is great, small, or wandering (moving).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When a slight displacement is caused by another'sintrusion into their place so that their breath becomes difficult (if you do not intervene with the insertion of them), then their belly and chest will become swollen, making it hard for them.
Therefore the best resolution would be to move it there where it is difficult in these specified parts of the body as well; namely, if difficulty arises when trying to reduce (manipulate) the hernia here, that's just how things are with such specific areas.
You know that the stitching of the belly is performed by four kinds of threads, and if you need to sew they should be common ones used for other diseases on the body.
When two other (own) stitches communicate with each other or themselves in the abdominal stitch, that may be sometimes even among them itself.
Here enters each one of you for examination and declaration.
So say when the patient is small and suffers from a hernia caused by it, reducing that becomes difficult; either because of its diminutive size as discussed earlier or due to inflammation caused by cold air:
And when the fluid enters (when water is present), immediately after you cut that which you submerge a moist cloth in it alone or as it flows into your hand, and ginger, pepper, and bandages enter together to aid in dissolving the inflammation inside.
When some warmth is applied in which there has been stoppage of flow (likely referring to blood or other bodily fluids), it is better than water alone for the resolution of inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in which it was elevated and swolthy with water; thus being addressed by a small cause within them.
May it be that the interior is spared from this treatment; otherwise, divide the rupture into small parts using a tool with which they have been previously instructed (the instruments for internal examinthy).
The initial text translates as follows line by line into English:
From the tool, its form is revealed:
One sharp turn of the tool, and the other not acute, and the subtlety that is neither in the thinness nor excessive – both are blunt at one end.
And when the vermin is increased and comes out of the hernia, it is necessary that its reduction be according to its own nature in its proper place if possible above water, which would be better for them.
May when the disruption is wide and occurs in the lower abdomen, where you apply pressure to the patient's thighs and place cushions under their legs; if it's below the abdomen, then press on the head of the patient and put supports beneath their back.
Here comes the first source sentence for translation: If there is disruption in one of the bowels' parts, then pause your understanding and contemplation immediately so that what causes it remains within itself to be treated afterwards.
And when you have provided care for these large and swolthy pus,
In the small pains you have prepared (prepared some remedy), place it between your hands that hold them tightly together; this way, they will grasp everything inside and adjust their lips to taste that which causes stitching here or there for any reason whatsosetup.

And between any stitch there is a quantity of the thick part of this bandage.
This stitch knows men.
E as soon as such stitching was done, it concerned the young child that had been sick in his belly where a large worm resided (in one of its holes), and this represented the rupture of the larger worm within a palm's span; moreover, there were fistulas around two palms from the site of the intestine perforation for hours.
And in the spaces of fifteen days or so, it is consolidated and healed there, with water applied for motion' extrication purposes, over time its properties change; within their arrangements they recover.

When you have had your turn to bear it, then make that bearing go between the extreme ends of this body portion from here downwards; and let the exterior wound also be turned inward within this location, making an incision there with a needle at the other end'se extremity.
When it is necessary for that point to enter into the cavity, and place your hand over there so that nothing from inside can escape through the entrance located at the end of its extension where he enters entirely within his body.
Here begins the treatment on this side of the patient's waist and up to that extremity, placing the needle from the coccyx down into it, retracting it back therein and thrusting it along the extreme end located on the other side opposite here; extract another such one which is out of him.

May the second special type of suture that Gualia teaches and recommends is its own middle child which heals as if it was cared for by another doctor who cuts this very same part, ensuring all parts are brought together appropriately according to nature; they apply one end from themselves (the practitioner) and the extremity of the other hand on their body, doing so in accordance with Gualia'se recommendations.
When you hold the needle at your designated part, and push that into the divided parts of the cistern in such a way that it goes from one end to another on both sides of the bladder; then turn the needle around and make that penetrate through the divide back into the bladder.
Here is the line-by extralinguistic translation:
This stitching is better than ordinary sewing thread for ligature, and it has been remembered from which this was made.
This is said by Galen
And if the discharge is thick and ropy from within (from the abdomen), then with two needles, sew upwards to form a thread for your fingers to insert into these numerous holes, so that you can begin inserting this thick thorn into those same stitches where their bodies are tied together.
When a disturbance occurs in the abdominal area of digestion, it is understood that its closure (or surgical repair) becomes more difficult than those elsewhere in the stomach region.
May the method of medicine for laymen be judgment by other illnesses.
When the cause occurs upon completion of recent labor during which air has altered that condition, return the intestine and hernia to their cavity properly positioning them over this fleshly covering so they remain contained.
If the air has altered the patient' extraneous body fluids, then rest upon that spot where you apply hard pressure and bandaging to consolidate/heal fields; take care of this fever as for other illnesses within which it is healing.
May you not have the medicines present at this very moment; if absent, pause over that place immediately and begin to take care of it with twofold application every day until cured, provided that while doing so, no other medicine will be needed from your arrangements when plagues are simple.
If you fear that the vermin may communicate in injury to the main body parts, then when you immerse wool (or linen) in warm or raspberry oil, pause it within the spaces between joints and around bony prominency where tendons lie, holding those appendages.
If there is pain or putrefaction in your intestines (budels), they move slowly, causing you to cringe tightly and more so if the protrusion has entered into its cavity and causes itching/pain inside of you.
Be aware that what is gross from the intestine heals better than what resides in the small bowels.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If what proceeds from the foulness is cloth (i.dicted as 'playa' or impure substance), you can obtain it freshly, and with this same material reduce those swellings on the belly immediately by your own actions ('reduces').
If space has been passed through and black or dark substance has already been extracted there, then press firmly the faithful hand over that spot where it was deteriorated, in order to expel bodily fluids from veins and arteries.

Remember when you had inflammation in the intestine (budel).
When you feel a disturbance in the intestine and it is small, it may be restored to its natural position within your body by pressing on this that was previously lodged painfully in your abdomen due to percussion of lance and belonged to the seventh part of the stomach, which is old/ancient and has a fistula; here we refer to the patient'gy management and ventilation.
And now you apply the treatment to him which was not confirmed in his healing process, may subtly address that internal focus where health is restored and the place becomes secure.
Here you have tightened the location already secured, guard over the thigh where an evil happens within their belly; it does not leave them due to some harmful accident in their intestines and between meals, as well as during physical exergy (exercise).
And experienced practitioners who when the patient enters into the bud (anus), and it is desired that they hold tightly with large caps; adjust their lips to those of the patient holding them therein while gripping a plug from these, so when you clutch onto those plugs and bite down hard on them, they adhere but do not dissolve.
Now pause or rest the first formed mass itself and do not cease making another as per the quantity of all that flies in our body, which refers to managing humoral imbalances according to ancient medical principles where 'plagues' can be understood metapthyically as excessive bodily fluids.
Reduce that and place it back in the cavity, breaking those attached scales within the intestine so that the intestine heals itself; without causing harm to anyone'thy disease (malaute).
And it may be possible that the intestine has been pierced by something from within these external animals' bodies using a needle; and you grasp its extremity here in your hand, which is held firmly against this part of the body, wrapping around, securing it with pins attached to this thread/needle atop that organ (intestine), reducing any disruption.
This surgical thread is only a second means of trust and hope.
May it be that the child is large and wide, mainly if it'sin one of the small intestines (budel), then it will not heal easily or at all in itself alone; such cases require a subtle intervention for their cure.
Of treatment for hernias and fistulas.
You understand that when all young and scab (apostema), it becomes ulcerous; however, the armor does not consolidate for long time nor detaches completely, in any part of the body where this occurs universally we call such a condition fistula.
E fistula according to truth is a tightly woven, hard fabric of which there is no pain and in which the patient'sease also finds relief like that of penance; thus they call it 'sharp agony,' namely, suffering or pain itself.

Return that which is inside in wax (which generates healthy flesh within while being healed).
May it not be healed by this water (implying a remedy), then you will have to perform caustic treatment on that second one we recommended.
If the cause of fistula is internal organs or veins/nerves and you wish to confirm it, then inquire about that specific one according to what we have mentioned; do not prohibit any investigation into these causes as long as they concern major body parts (thighs, legs, chest).
If you discover that your bones are weak and there is decay within them, then take care of the area where the decay has taken residence completely; and give special attention to whatever fluid inside contains this sickness so it can be healed entirely.
If it is not healed and filth accumulates with the old habit (implying poor hygiene or lifestyle), then you will understand that you have not yet reached total cure; hence immediately investigate further on this person, perform deep cleaning of their body thoroughly as quickly as possible, and restore what remains.
And if it heals, eat; but if not, then understand that the corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which has not been reached yet, and therefore you must seek to address that as well.

And when the wound is in a small location as we have mentioned.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut out that corrupted joint, and saw off where it continues from the other parts.
If decay is in the continuous flow of pains at joints, it'thy not due to reason but rather necessity (or perhaps a deficiency or excess within).

Be mindful of where the screws and saw blades should be inserted into these bones, as well as their size, bulkiness, subtlety, grandeur, smallness; firmness, rareness - so that whatever tools you prepare are suitable for this specific operation.
When you understand that this operation concerns the specifics of the instrument with which you operate; when you are great in knowledge and experience concerning these instruments' techniques, as well as witnesses to their use for various illnesses, then you already possess what is necessary for your intervention on behthyroid equipment.

But instead of using them as mentioned above (which might not be their intended purpose), they are rubbed on the joints when corrupted or have a wide mouth for this application, which could indicate an alternative non-standard use outside typical medical contexts—possibly in folk medicine. It's important to note that such descriptions often lack precision and may include unscientific practices not endorsed
Shapes or forms of smaller blades possibly for more precise cuts in medical procedures.

The extremities are swolthy or because of an internal cause or external causes; when you treat that decay with these medicines and the treatment does not relieve, sometimes the decay moves from a member which is touched by no cause, so then put your hand into this part to prevent the humors from escaping outwards. Here comes the translation:
And as for the person you are treating, it is blackened inside because the flame has cut into them or if applied pressure turns that darkness within, affecting the entire body wherein this leads to a hernia appearing in that part of their body; hence understand yourself insidiously towards him.

This translation attempts to capture the essence of the medieval medical text while trying to reflect its language and context as closely as possible:
Of care for the navel and the quality of enema administration with medicine.
When an abscess forms in the flesh of joints and limbs, and its space within becomes filled with disease which is being collected therein; it gets cut through and perforated, causing illness to spread from this location as if carrying a vessel (referring perhaps to pus or infected fluid), yet without reaching destruction beyond these areas into bone or nerves/tendons. The wound calls for gentle suction ("sinu"), and does not develop fistulas.
Even if spaces are extended within where decay is already present in any part of the body, it will be called a fistula and cannot return to normality.
The cure of the patient is that they insert their entire bedpan completely while turning and mainly when it feels like a drape, making sure not to stick due to its decay.
May you hope that the intestine will stick and not have deteriorated due to any previous action; in this case, treat it with a cleansing enema (clister).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes the first sentence to translate: Apply from it that which is necessary and dissolves in water and honey; administer this enema into its passageway, steam bathe his organs with it, and leave the medicine inside for as many hours of dose time.
When that which has been exposed is cleansed, and it continues to be rubbed for as many days until the curvature of the body is purified and modesty returned,
Here are the translations line by line:
If the malady cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water of charcoal, then you will administer that with water and honey mixed three times over, which acts as a cleanser because of the properties of honey; it helps adhere to the sinus area. Especially when sputum accumulation has exceeded what is needed for expectoration or dryness relief.
When you have taken a few waters and find yourself comforted by the sensation of your belly being full again (indicating relief or feeling better after taking water), then, when it happens that there is an excess in the body which makes the flesh swell, perform enema on that matter.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And when wicks of olive oil dissolve that which has become hardened and sticky, or you cleanse it with some medicines and oils that have these properties already applied in the treatment of liniments.
If the fluid of the intestine is spread out in which no catheter has been received, then gradually increase that small amount and pause under a wrap made from Egyptian oil or wax-based ointment until it is increased.
When the catheter is large, then you should insert your lips into it and leave a certain amount in between where excrement will enter during a bowel movement (enema).
If the patient'thy flow that runs through their veins is raised above where it resides in them, causing hardness at those parts below (in his body), when the blood becomes entrapped due to constriction within a curve of flesh (possibly referring to arterial blockage or venous insufficiency), then:
If it is not possible to sear the channel within the body of the patient, then pierce and prepare their limb as needed for lifting them up according to your desire, so that nothing holds back this movement in the leg or bracelet (brace).
When one is above the sinew, which hardens in any moment as if moisture has been adjusted within their chest, Through which you understand if that matter running down from below of his body is either moist or dry, or indigested (not properly digested).
When you have considered the location of that fluidity, if in it the patient feels pain or suffering, and if there is an abscess present:
When your medicine is prolonged in this manner, and the material that has adhered to the bedcloth of the vagina sticks on it, or if there's an attachment (adhesion), then you should apply pressure with a linen cloth for three days. When you remove the dressing, change the bandage and renew the ointment.
May if of sinus (perhaps referring to the respiratory tract) you expand spaces where subtle viruses may reside; do not despair for attachment therein because healing occurs in those places, and on which it happens they bring about recovery late into life when flesh is plagued by illnesses.
If the belch has overflowed for many days, you understand that it does not stick; and if delayed adherence of the belch is prolongation'n cause, then adjust by means of purgative medicines, when they are wet with their essence and nature in excess addition. When applied superfluously to dressing down phlegm (discharges), use ointments moistened with diaphaneolus extracts accordingly for correction at that time.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And when it seems that no relief is forthcoming while you apply oil (or other substances like frankincense and myrrh), use them; or cover the cloth with these oils as well on your palm, then rub everything over the warmth where they are applied, along with powders sprinkled upon this area.
Here are the translations for each line of the medieval medical treatise:
If the swelling persists and does not heal with this treatment, you understand that the corruption is in the bone or hard parts of the body such as limbs; already have conducted an examination on the bones or other hard structures; alas, treat it according to fracture care.
Of treatment for inflamed skin and nail pain added along with cutting of digits,
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When you puncture the quality that has just now appeared on either the heel or foot's sole/surface, and in these others it continues and as its treatment becomes valued, then an apostematic wound occurs (or is formed), which consumes all of this quickly due to decaying blood within those veins—and because of that consumption even more rapidly enters into the bone from where it gives off a foul odor. The limb's extremity thus becomes painful, and its color turns blackish.
And when you have applied that water which we mentioned in the division and do not hinder your care, then apply iron to remove all superfluous moisture from the skin and afterward use cautioner on this water, for cauteries are beneficial at such times.

From the extraction of the vein in the leg (translation based on understanding medieval medical terminology). The text likely describes
From the extraction of veins in the lower lands, as Al-Atabi did on Arabic soil and in the dry deserts with little vegetation where neither grass nor plant grows to provide sustenance for animals or people alike (translation takes into account medieval medical lexicon). This passage likely describes a location or environment deemed challenging due to its aridity, lack of flora, making it difficult not only for living creatures but also implying difficulties in obtaining medicinal resources from the area.
However, it is born out of other regions' cushions (translation reflects medieval medical language). This sentence suggests that certain conditions or diseases might originate from different parts than previously mentioned veins

The text appears concerned with symptoms indicative of hemorrhage or severe inflammation within an infected area, suggesting that urgent care might be necessary. Such descriptions would have been common in treatises for identifying the onset and progression of diseases using observable signs like oozing blood resembling plant sap – a term possibly drawing from metaphorical comparisons to understand bodily fluids
And when the extremity appears, cover it with one of those iron balls on which is placed the weight of two dragons, and do not smell that iron ball hanging from the cushion.

From capitol (chapter) VIII of this medieval medical treatise translation into English
The phrase "restauracio delle costa quando sono spezzate" translates to "repair of the coast when broken." This line likely
The translation for this line is: "Bones of the coast are not cracked but in large pieces, and from their extremities coming downward do not go to those contractions directly, but through thin membranes." Here'dictated text refers to a medical practice where fractured or broken bone segments (presumably referring metap each limb) should be handled carefully. Instead of being placed directly into large breaks ("locs grosses"), they are suggested not for immediate application within those larger breakages but rather through thin membranous structures, possibly describing the approach to immobilizing and healing such injuries in The translation of this line is: "I understand that it's not crazy for you to ask about them here." This suggests a person has knowledge or insight into something specific, and recognizes the appropriateness (or lack thereof) in question
The translation for this line is: "Repair should be attempted on the fractured bones here as best possible according to ability, and bind tightly with splints or strapping if required from there." This advice implies a method of stabilizing broken limbs using makeshift materials such as plaster casts (if available) applied by someone else who has knowledge. It reflects the medieval approach where practical solutions were sought for fractures, often relying on simple immobilization techniques until further care could be provided or professional help arrived.
The translation for this line is: "If the rib fracture descends into pieces at joint areas, they suffer sharp pain and piercing sensation, where you must apply pressure as with a cautery that has been cried upon by him; then bandage tightly his bones. There will also be difficulty of breathing, cough, and vomiting of phlegm-like substance; this is difficult to treat." Here the text describes symptoms associated with serious rib fractures—sharp pain during movement or deep inhalation indicates a potentially life-threatening injury requiring immediate attention. The mention that it's "difficult to cure" acknowledges both the severity of such injuries and possibly the limited treatment options available at the time, highlighting an urgent need for proper care beyond home remedies or simple splint application mentioned previously in simpler cases of fractures. This underscores medieval medicine's understanding that certain types of trauma necessitated more advanced intervention than could be typically provided by non-special

The bones of the limbs are broken and if they break further, it's not just a communication in those extremities; rather, their length is considered while descending to these parts—thereby inciting pain at the site where there was already damage from fractures.

If you harden the plaster applied to the healing of your wound, then wrap another cloth dipped in rosemary oil and white wax around it tightly within where the application is placed; afterward place a poultice made from powdered flower mixed with clay for cleaning above that area until the hardened plaster softens. Then remove the wax and reapply the fresh prepared poultice, holding pressure over the fractured bone you previously set in place and fixed firmly.

And if the spasm has subsided and your bones are returning to normal form like those around it, then correct yourself with a straightened posture as is in your control or ability (possibly suggesting physical therapy). The phrase indicates that once medical intervention leads to an improvement of symptoms – such as reduced muscle tension leading the way for skeletal alignment and recovery - attention should be given back to maintaining proper body position. This suggests a hol
And consider if the nourishment is forbidden to prevent further strain on the limb affected by excessive tightness; in such cases, you may softly moisten that part with water throughout today until it reaches (or receives) its needed nutriment (food or sustenance). This implies an old medical practice where gentle hydration was used to alleviate pain and possibly restore the proper function of a limb when dietary intake is restricted for health reasons. Here, 'strengthen' can be understood as restoring vitality by appropriate nutrition within permitted means or time constraints (as alluded to with "alcus dias entro que corra ad aquel le nut
And if the humors (referring to bodily fluids) are not producing any additional causes of those mentioned before, do not delay in sending help or relief for more than two days concerning these matters among them; this suggests that timely intervention is crucial when signs and symptoms persist without apparent cause related to internal conditions such as imbalance of humors. The phrase underscs the importance placed on rapid response by medieval medical practitioners if a condition does not resolve within
And place its abdomen down by reason of its active motion being disturbed, so that it may rest on its backs.

When you strike the wound or fracture on the body, let the humors follow and flow down for ten days in equal measure, then place your hand over that extended area.
Whenever necessary, extend the broken bones and let the doctor manipulate them into good alignment.

The bone of the hip has been moved and is described according to how it'suposedly fits into its usual position, suggesting that care should be taken with respect to posture or body placement following such an injury. This line indicates attention was paid both before (denant) and after ("pus sobirana") a potentially traumatic event leading to the fracture of the hip bone in someone's thigh area, which could imply
The repair process is done such that the sinew (likely referring to a type of binding or splint) tightens over the break and another immediately afterward; meanwhile, the patient's hip bone rests on their belly and face—this suggests an immobilization technique using body positions combined with some form of external fixation. Here medieval medical practitioners seem to be employing a method where multiple limbs or bindings are strategically applied after fracture care, possibly for stabilizing the injured area effectively during healing as understood in their context and technology available at
Extend fully the sinew to its position where it meets with the bone (implying at the site of healing or immobilization), as when the break is made in place within the body—this implies a meticulous technique for applying tension and support directly over the fracture point, potentially suggesting an early form of splinting tail
If applied to the hip bone (implying external manipulation), then one sinew is tightened at its meeting with the femur section of the pelvis ("partida del pentenilh"), ensuring that extension occurs along their body, and another immediately afterward—this points towards a treatment approach where additional bindings or splints are used in conjunction to maintain proper positioning for healing. The use here implies an early form of external fixation with multiple components carefully managed by the practitioner (liament) during recovery from hip fracture injuries as they would understand them, likely relying on manual adjustments and body

The translation of the provided text, which seems to originate from an old medical language possibly Latin-based (given your mention of medieval times and similarity with languages like Italian or Spanish), about a fracture involving the hip socket ("coh" for "cup" referring to the
When the hip socket of the woman is broken (fractured), it must be placed in that position where there's been an incline towards one side and held behind by means of restraint or support: this could suggest a method for immobilizing the fractured joint during medieval times. Here, "le conh" likely refers to the acetabulum (the hip socket), while "os del pentenilh e de la vergua del home," translates loosely as 'bone of five and humerus bone at shoulder,'
Moreover, the matron (likely referring to an older female attendant or midwife) places the hip socket of another in that position with hope; and for the woman who is also fractured ('and her humerus bone at shoulder'), she elevates their little body bit by bit until whatever force was causing them pain has been removed, allowing (possibly referring to a form of gentle manipulation or treatment) when they are in that position with hope. This sentence likely outlines an early medieval care technique for fractures involving the hip socket and shoulder: gently lifting ("elevate") part by part ('bit by bit') while maintaining supportive positions, possibly indicating a precursor to more modern orthopedic procedures aimed at healing without undue strain.
Here's the translation line by line:

To which one should apply the broken bone of an animal (presumably referring to veterinary care), particularly if it is badly fractured or associated with other injuries, like those related to limbs ("cuoyssa") and assistants who also take part in these procedures. If you're trained as a surgeon ('testifico') for such tasks, then perform the surgery on that very bone if conditions permit (as mentioned by your assistant or colleague).
If the child faints, then cover them to prevent their return until you see signs of life again, unless another cause is apparent.

If your bone is broken above the neck (cervical), then you must reduce it and immobilize that, with your hands making things easier for you and causing little extension.
May you not be prepared and the couch of your patient are in their throats, at this time reduce that part for those parts; it is a piece made of iron with its length being seven digits or eight [inches] long, and tube diameter according to how much mud (patient's body fluid) there is.

You understand that the muscle is not dislocated but by one of three ways, which way it'm dislocated between the parts where the tendon attaches to and moves away from quickly.
And the second is that it has become dislocated at the upper segment of the muscle, and pain occurs here too; but it does not occur in the parts behind for the shoulder joint or ahead towards the nerves.
Mostly it is a displacement and departure of the body' extraterritory, mainly in those parts where bones are thin, dislocation occurs; perhaps even there when muscles contract (difficulties).
And when the cold touches their bones through palpation or setting up (percussion or compression), and their muscle is set in place by a fracture due to displacement, it becomes inflamed as well.
And when you cry out that you are overserved by the water (possibly indicating too much fluid in your body), then proceed with its cure.
And when dislocation occurs at the joints after being disturbed; so that you can distinguish between the displaced muscle and its original position; remove from among these differences the concavity of the affected muscle' extrinsic part, where even a hand cannot reduce it to the shoulder socket nor extract any moisture therefrom through all movements.
If it is a displacement of the joint or limbs and you see signs of bruising without fearing injury furthermore:
From this dislocation it is felt that there will be relief when it cools down and humors descend into the malady.

E returns are already rested on the patient'thy thighs and have extended arms over or along their body into parts just now inside a chest-barrier, holding onto the staff as well as hands and wrists extensions of themselves.
Here is the line-by extralined translation:
When the body's interior is completed according to any possible manner you have prepared and paused momentarily for prayer cloth spun from wool of moderate quantity; and a plaster made with mill flour and alum paste, applied all over the muscle so that it may be turned outwards, and firmly pausing at each tightening point, turning the bandage around on itself, ensuring attachment to the patient's chest, secured therein for seven days without causing discomfort.
When the food of the malady is paused even for a little while, and thus comforts the body part, then it is placed on healing.
And if it is given more abundant food and engage in some kind of motion, then even if they do not soften or become supple, already they begin to heal.
If the joint is dislocated due to humidity that you have caused or for another reason, then in that case, administer three types of cautery as described in the book on cauteries.
If all pain is felt and seven days have passed since the ligament and joint were not fixed together, then with occasional bandaging or constriction they are reduced over time; consequently, that arm cannot be raised to parts above it, as you know that its nerves either lie at the top of muscle (proximal), extend downwards or become softened/mollified.
Of the dislocation that is felt in their chest and thighs or parts behind, reduction is made by force and extension until return to normal position occurs within which they must rest.
When it is administered in that place, and heals within which has been made well.
If there is weakness in the limb and delay in the patient' extraneous motion, then have mercy on them with regular baths until that gravity loss has been alleviated and their original state returns first.

Curación (healing) of the hip joint displacement." Translated, this suggests a medical concern related to the mis
The provided medieval medical text discusses the signs and methods for dealing with hip joint dislocations ("codo") as understood in that time period:
When you open the hips, reduce the dislocation as much as possible immediately so that healing with a cast occurs; if there is already an immobilization cast on him, it' extrication becomes difficult and not completely curative—mainly when at the posterior parts where all other species of displacement occur, causing greater pain and movements directed towards that area leading to death.
When the restoration is possible, it is that the patient'dict hand should be stretched out and extended as far as they can reach, their arms expanded too; and doctors stand on their hips or sit with knees bent, placing hands at joints of patients’ extremities to push them back into place.
If the dislocation is at the joints ahead, return to where it was pushed back into place until a touch on its area causes movement in that part of the body.
If the dislocation does not submit to reduction, apply vigorous extension and forceful motion.
When two ministers stretch their arms and hold that instrument between them so it does not get extended too far,
And turn over his arms completely, placing a long cloth or cord around the area of him/her, fastening it with a leash.
When the doctor touches the joint with his hand, anoint that area with some oil to help alleviate its causes and thus promote lubrication of the joint; furthermore, apply pressure firmly until it returns (to normal function).
And apply the reduction of him where it is stopped upon that layer in which his fixation and swelling are located within the albummous humors' cavity, with his arm hanging from the neck, lying on a cushion for several days.
And thus if the joint is dislocated at that place, then dislocate its ligament and apply it there.
If you see the joint not strong, repeat the bandage and ligature, leaving it in place for several days until it is expelled; then remove that as well.
If you apply pressure to the joint reduction and its position is in motion, then administer moisture with water and dry heat gently until it subsides; when there'thy movement hernia, that area of fatty mass; secure it tightly, and lay such over bones above, on body during daytime and night. Return that one (the affected limb or body part), and immerse it in the bath; when sweating occurs at the cold joint, repeatedly rub the area where movement is rumbling, for on the first day of treatment, and then again on the second and third days. When bathing is introduced that it enters within (the body).
If you wish, rest over that wet and injured cow'dictum border and strain upon it; do so for some time, then that very same will become dry and return to its proper disposition.
Capitol .xxviii.: This line appears to be referencing an ancient Roman law
Regarding the care of hip displacement, it is in the joint between the arm and the body where attention should be focused. This line suggests that when addressing a dislocation (commonly referred to as luxation) involving the pelvis or "hip," medical professionals need to concentrate
Dislocated in the body some times are found, and hip joint reduction is more delicate, it concerns other joints as well; yet if a dislocation occurs with or near an existing fracture (apostemphobia), then quick intervention may be necessary to address what has become immobilized. This line emphasizes the complexity of treating dislocated hips that are complicated by additional injuries, highlighting the need for prompt action and careful consideration given other potentially affected joints when such an emergency arises where swift hip reduction is required alongside dealing with a pre-existing fracture causing immobility.
The reduction of the dislocation is that you stop the junction between the hip bone above and below a tabletop, and extend it from there; let the doctor or their hand rest on the impending joint, and push it back to its original place.
Indeed, when the palm is resting on the stomach, then let the humors be extended and reduced above; if there has been a dislocation beforehand, place her body'dictly over that very board where reduction should occur so that the doctor can cover it.
So then if it returns shortly afterward, all is well; but if the pain remains severe and persistent (it becomes inflamed), apply pressure to that spot until relief comes naturally over time. Do not intervene further unless necessary for several days.
Indeed the joint of Rome according to its curvature; and there is no cause in Malady, but it softens itself and cannot be strengthened for any reason—know that your nerves are twisted or spasmed, and only when tightly bound with cautery on purpose do you provide a source of moisture through which water can accumulate.
So when the patient becomes restless and returns to movement after being immobilized with what has been recommended, their pause is placed again on them for days; similarly, they are cut off from it (immobility) and hand exergy (strength or vital energy of hands) is exercised.
May it happen that the patient' extraneous movement occurs and you apply water at their tail end and some cold applications; do so until they are relieved.

From the treatment of vertebral displacement in two (presumably referring to both sides or aspects). The sentence seems incomplete and may require additional context for full translation,
When one of the vertebrae in the back or neck is fractured and dislocated completely, and there are now displaced spinal bones at that location; this cannot be treated here, for death will occur into the humors (referring to internal body fluids). The sentence suggests a severe medical emergency where immediate intervention could save life by repairing or stabilizing fractured vertebrae before fatal complications set in.
If the matter of excess malaute (presumably blood or bile imbalance) is outside one'sin control, and it cannot be held back; moistening actions are taken for either your own limbs to ease them or apply linen on their legs, arms, or two pillows under you. If a vertebra dislocation occurs from such excess humoral disturbance in the body; these external treatments also serve as temporary measures before urgent care is provided—the immediate removal and subsequent management of displaced spinal bones into four distinct parts for easier handling by medical practitioners, indicating an advanced understanding that fragmented vertebrae might be repositioned or addressed piece-bys in the context of medieval medicine.
So then she is swollen behind and without discoloration.

May enter through cauterization or percussion to these places already familiar with ancient curing methods detailed in the speech; may they also open from where it is hidden, due to their current closeness proximity, at which point they have expelled and formed various instruments of this one for demonstration and spacing out.
From those things it is not healed but that which you apply directly and with water, as recommended by the doctor.
It is that the humidity extends over their face downward from above due to urine discharge, and it stretches rapidly through them so as not to wet their chest.

If it does not return through this manner, then take a table of which the length or width is three cubits (a cubit being roughly equal to one foot), and carve into the wall where we previously indicated that the swelling should be located within reach at the extremity of the table. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to twist the part that has been turned over on your chest; and it is necessary for you to keep the head of malady at the end of two staves, with lengths equal to one arm's length each, along which both ends are positioned: a third staff in between any two staves will have such length as from thumb to palm (approximately hand span), and it has been twisted within some stick where motion is possible; ensuring that none of the elements remains fixed on land so they cannot become gouty.
If you have a staff in which it is turned and twisted between the two halves of the sticks,
In the limb there is a defect where it forms wood of which its length equals a hand when rotated; and in the two other sticks, they resemble that one.
Return the ligaments that you have stretched in the groin of the malady where it needs to be pulled out (and they need your head), and the ones that are stretched in the hollows of the legs for which it requires their weight (they require your head).
When each turn and joint must have one appointed who tightens the thread around its place, as mentioned by our doctor, he will manipulate the spine accordingly.
And then I placed the spine back in place, and covered it with bandage wound dressing made of albumen (egg white), along with stuffing; after that, over this filling inside the wooden chair'supra tail section whereof latitude is three fingers or more than these dimensions, its length must extend to absorb moisture from decay.
And return its ligature back as we have mentioned beforehand, and place the humoral substance within so that it is healed.
If there is any danger at the location of healing during recovery time, then it has been advised that medicines be administered to moisten and cleanse the area for a long period, which have been recommended; and now a layer of lead has already been applied in this spot.
And at times there is an impending collapse in the lower vertebrae of the back, and it gets dislocated; this one from which you should not expect pain as part of its treatment with this medicine, for if left untreated, it could lead to your death.

Understanding the translation line by line:
The joint of the wide is dislocated according to four ways, it can be dislocated at the parts divided below, or above them, forward from them, behind them, or in between their thighs (the patient' extramural hernia).
Mostly it is dislocated at joints below or behind them and scarcely in parts forward from the hips.
E for the dislocation of his body parts is when you adjust the bedspan sore on the bedlam, it'sup long and I put humility out that from healthfulness, the bedlam cannot double their knee with its tongue holding an apostomatic puncture attached to apostema cauterization so that head of thigh comes here.
The title of that person from whom you have caused displacement is because the accidents of him are contrary to this accident.
E senhal of that to which you dislocate now spreads outward through the cushion below, and even if it bends its pain in the joint therein, but cannot move onwards; urine is retained within it, and a drop (dropcasting) forms upon it—you must walk with him upon his heel.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and indeed if the dislocation is old and ancient, it has already been addressed by your past interventions here at home, according to its disposition; consequently there' extrinsic pain will not appear in that treatment.
May it be in the recent one where dislocation has occurred, and which is among the four types of dislocation, then turn that part over to restore the joint and extend it to the limbs' parts above and below, as well on the right and left sides; once returned, no other treatment will suffice.
May it be that if the patient does not return in this treatment session, then those who have prepared must act forcefully and extend the cushion from where they initially placed under his legs intermittently (or at intervals), or on their hands; another servant extends the pressure of what is above to below as far as possible so that hand movements can stimulate sensations in him. Moreover, a strap holds onto whatever has been positioned beneath it and secures its place firmly over there: one more attendant presses down upon his legs with something soft; another ensures the extremity of this device is handled delicately by someone else'dictating their touch-tactile interaction.
When it is an extension from the limb or between its joints to the shoulder blade' extraneous portion of the thorax, or vice versa; that is, when movement extends beyond these boundaries:
And if it is a stretching of all these within the period that allows for an upward movement of evil humors to their head above ground and rolling downwards, then...
This specific form of extension is special for all four (or means/methods) as mentioned hereinabove or elsewhere in this text.
And if the dislocation returns with water that we have mentioned, then beware; otherwise, it is necessary throughout all special waters for their own healing treatment.
In the patient's own reduction, when dislocated, and dislocation is at its divisions, whereby the swelling can be placed on their back; and pause the ligaments over the region between the top of the thigh and where it comes down to join with the shoulder blade (the furcula); and extend the ligament in parts of the arm.
Then call upon another minister with strong breaths to press the bulge of the hernia in large motions back into its place, where it returns on its own accord.
This specific substance is of yellow bile curative for which this member is reduced, meaning other substances.
May it be that you can rest on top of us and not obey to this special kind of healing whereby the two balls at the hips are intertwined tightly by ligament, both feet and knees as well as ankles, holding our hands together firmly.
Whenever any part of the body' extrinsic length is four times its size and the hernia extends as far as two lengths, then:
And lift up his leg over the head of the staff, and have it at ease; its length from the ground is that of two braces.

And each minister extends to his/her respective area; and the doctor holds their hand for reduction according to art.
When dislocation occurs at the joints below (the knees and ankles), it is time to change the cushioning pad, according to this method of treatment described by the physician; he holds his palm with four fingers on the lower leg area where the misalignment occurred.
If the dislocation is at the joints behind, do not allow the humors to spread outwards onto the parts below and rise above the ground; those who have it should be covered with something hard if the patient's shoulder (shoulder blade) has been dislocated from these parts. Their faces and ligaments are extended as well, according to what we mentioned about their condition on two broad areas; there is no pain here for them.
When compression is applied with a tablet over the location where the joint pain occurs,
So that when the reduction is complete, as denoted by "cove," and your name isn't associated with this action of reducing—extend legs from underneath (implied to be using cushions), reposition these supports once they are adjusted, ensuring each leg bends back into place. After doing so, you check the hollows between the thighs for any remaining dislocations and straighten them out; also apply bandages wide enough that even when stretched, it won't tightly grip at waistbands (implied purpose to maintain some space). Secure this pressure dressing in place for three days or four.
Return the ligaments and bandaging, and compare one strap with another.
And if you see those swolthy in their state of illness, know that the displacement is already fixed, and so let your malady go forth from thereon.
If you see any cause of suppuration (infection), return and apply that dressing according to your first layer'setup, and leave it on for three days.
Return that item, and have it take time in walking on these few days until they are comfortable.

The translation of this line into English is: "Spinal displacement occurs in three manners – at the extremities (distal parts), within, and behind it; but not from where it currently lies." This sentence likely describes different methods or circumstances under which a spinal dislocation can occur according to medieval medical understanding. Here's how this translation breaks down line by line:

When in the treatment of him when he is dislocated as a supplementary measure, do make sure to straighten his thigh properly and hold that leg'several hands strong and valuable from behind the two legs at this spot on him.
Return yourself at the top of your waist and hold onto your left side where there is flesh from above on the location of the hernia.
Return the leg to your left hand for three times, and with both hands move it back and forth twice, pressing firmly on the chest where you need work done by these movements.

Here the doctor aligns the dislocation back to its joint spaces, and another minister holds the healthy area of the body until the dislocation returns to ease.
Therefore, when the dislocation is returned and its healing declared by you (the doctor), then apply pressure firmly with bandaging and extend that very same sinew attached to the hernia; bind it tightly around the area where this has occurred in order not for the intestines or related humors to escape.
And when you fear or protect the tendons that are behind on the foot, to prevent the ligament from being violent and leading it strongly.
