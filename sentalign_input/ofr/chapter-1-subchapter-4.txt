of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of illnesses, and it is not effective, and you see that the aforementioned cauterizations with medicine and iron are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery which is called "cultellar" until it is white; and first mark on the painful spot a line half a finger long, and remove your hand immediately, and restrain yourself so that you do not cut the artery and that you do not go down to the bone; and beware of the mandible which moves when one chews, and the nerve which controls it so that spasms do not occur in the patient, and beware of bleeding from the artery when it is cut, where cutting is very dangerous, especially for one who is not familiar with it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leaves the work half done; but I will tell you how to stop the blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cauterization is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed; and if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than the other and more helpful.
