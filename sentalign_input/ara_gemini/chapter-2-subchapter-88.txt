Chapter eighty-eight on the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medications.
If a swelling occurs in some fleshy member and the duration of the swelling is prolonged until it gathers pus, then bursts or is lanced and all the pus within it comes out and the place remains empty like a vessel, and the skin on it, like a rag, has thinned, and its corruption has not reached the point of affecting bone, nerve, or ligament, for this reason it deserves to be called a 'hidden' (mukhaba'), and it is not called a fistula unless its duration lengthens until the corruption affects something from these members, then at that time it is called a fistula or zakama.
And its treatment is to cut that whole skin as it goes around, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption. But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and the corruption in it has not reached that extent, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an injection.
And that is, you look at the hidden (mukhaba'), and if it is large and the pus that flows from it has a foul odor, inject it with the Egyptian medicine which is vinegar, oil, honey and verdigris, equal parts, gathered in a vessel, and cooked on the fire until the medicine thickens and comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take your need of it, and thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the hidden (mukhaba') and bind its mouth and leave the medicine in it for about two hours, then remove it by squeezing, do this for days until the hidden (mukhaba') is cleansed and the foul odor goes away.
It may be injected with ash water if you don't have this medicine available.
And that is, you take the ash of vine wood or the ash of oak wood and pour water on it, then filter it and inject it with it until you are certain that the hidden (mukhaba') has been washed.
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then inject him with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed, or inject him with honey and wine mixed, because it is the nature of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine adheres to the hidden (mukhaba'), especially if the wine has extra astringency and dryness.
So if you do that several times, and you are certain that the corruption of the hidden (mukhaba') has gone, inject it with something that grows flesh in it, such as taking some of the palm ointment and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine, or injecting it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose properties we established in the article on ointments.
If the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba') is narrow, not accommodating the tube of the syringe, then widen it slightly with iron or place in it a wick soaked in the Egyptian ointment or the siryqun ointment until it widens. Likewise, if the mouth is too wide, then gather its lips with stitching, leaving of it just enough for the syringe to enter, no more. Likewise, if its mouth from which pus flows is elevated upwards, then slit it in its lowest place so that the pus flows downwards, because if the pus is congested in the depth of the hidden (mukhaba') it prevents flesh from growing in it. If you cannot slit the hidden (mukhaba') towards its bottom as you want, then you must position the limb so that the pus flows easily from it according to what is possible for you, and be sure that no pus is retained in it at all.
As for the healing medicines that are placed on the hidden (mukhaba') externally and how to place them on it, it is that you take one of the healing ointments appropriate to what you want and spread it on a linen cloth, and let the cloth be as large as will cover the entire hidden (mukhaba'). Then cut with scissors opposite the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba') a hole slightly wider than the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba'). Then spread some of the soft ointments on another cloth the size of the hole and place it on it, placed away from the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba') to facilitate the exit of pus from it, and do not remove the large cloth except after several days.
As for the one on the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba'), it is the one that you remove every time, so that the pus gathered in it comes out, and so you know what flows from it of pus, whether it is much or little, or mature or immature.
And with this also, inspect the site of the hidden (mukhaba') itself, whether its owner feels pain in it or there is no pain in it, and whether there is swelling in it or there is no swelling in it.
So if your treatment proceeds in this way, and you see that the substance that comes out is slight on the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba'), then know that the hidden (mukhaba') has adhered or is close to adhering, so then loosen it tomorrow or on the third day, and when you loosen the wound, replace the cloths with others and renew the ointment.
If thin pus comes out of the hidden (mukhaba') after a long time, do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is near, because among people some have slow flesh growth in their wounds and some the opposite of that.
If immature pus comes out of the hidden (mukhaba') after many days, know that the hidden (mukhaba') has not adhered. If the adherence of the hidden (mukhaba') is slow and its matter prolonged, increase the drying of the medicines, and let the medicines be moist in their consistency and dry in their potency, such as the palm ointment if an extra amount of qalqatar has been added to it.
And among the most effective things that it is treated with is that the palm ointment is taken and dissolved with rose oil and the aged wine, moderate in its consistency, is sprinkled on it, then you knead it with it and use it.
And a similar action may be done, if the palm ointment is not available to you, with honey, if you cook it until it thickens and use it, or you take myrrh, aloe and frankincense, and grind all of it and sprinkle it on the honey while it is on the fire, then spread it on a cloth and bind it on the hidden (mukhaba'), or spread on it honey that you've cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle the drugs on it, and place the cloth on it and bind it.
And long ziravand, the root of the German iris, cress flour and centaury may be used in such a case, whether you use them singly or combined, you grind them, sift them, and sprinkle them on the honey I described and use it.
If the matter of the hidden (mukhaba') is prolonged and it does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth and it has affected the bones or the rest of the hard nerves or ligaments, so treat it with the treatment of the fistula as described above.
