of the fracture of the shoulder blade/collarbone	On setting a fracture of the humerus. The humerus is what lies between the elbow and the head of the scapula.	0.44751826
The shoulder blade/collarbone is that which is between the neck and the head of the shoulder, and if it is fractured, it should be restored according to one of two methods: one of which is that you take a moderately thick piece of wood, in this shape:	The humerus is what lies between the elbow and the head of the scapula. If it is fractured it may be set in one of two ways. One is to take a smooth bow-shaped piece of wood of medium thickness, like this.	0.7374666
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them up high, and have the patient sit on a seat; then place their broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the armpit, and in the middle have a curved piece of wood, then hang some heavy object or have an assistant pull it downwards; then the physician sets the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns to how it should be.	You tie two bands at the two ends and then it is hung from above. The patient is to sit on a seat; then his broken arm is folded upon the piece of wood in such a way that his axilla fits into the middle of the curve of the piece of wood. Then hang a heavy weight from the arm, or have an assistant pull it downwards; then the doctor should straighten out the fracture with both hands together until it is properly reduced.	0.92066765
And the other method is that the patient is put on their back, and their hand is tied to their neck, then two assistants are instructed, one to hold above the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold below with a cord, and each pulls on their side.	The other way is to make the patient lie back and to suspend his hand from his neck by a band, then you instruct two assistants. One is to grasp with both hands the arm above the fracture, and the other the arm below the fracture; and each should make extension toward himself.	0.90125966
And if you wish the pulling to be stronger, tighten a cord below the fracture, and above the fracture, and each assistant pulls on their side.	And if you wish to extend more strongly, tie a band below the fracture and another above, and let each assistant pull toward himself.	0.89055777
And if the fracture is near the head of the shoulder, you must place a cord moderately tight under the armpit, and another towards the neck, below the fracture; and also if the fracture is towards the neck, a cord must be placed there lightly, without straining, until the fracture is even on top of the area, and on the neck; then set the fracture evenly, as is necessary, and bind it, if hot swelling/inflammation does not arise.	If the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder you will have to put one band beneath the axilla and the other below the fracture near the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture be near the elbow you will have to put a band over the place and over the elbow itself. Then gently and without violence straighten out the fracture until it is restored to its proper shape and fits together well, and then tighten it if no abscess occur.	0.8624599
And if hot swelling/inflammation arises, do not bind it for up to seven days, and apply wool moistened in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot swelling/inflammation subsides; then bind it, and the way to bind it is to put the plaster on the fracture, then bring the arm against the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the chest; and place the cloth, and bind it over the shoulder, and over the arm, so that the arm is in the shape of a star, unless something prevents it, or if the bone is not displaced.	But if an abscess occur, leave the bandaging until the seventh day and apply raw wool soaked in vinegar and oil of roses until the abscess subsides; then bind it up. The method of binding it is to apply a plaster to the fracture; then wind round the plaster a bandage of new material; then bind the forearm to the humerus, placing his hand open on his shoulder. Then apply pads and bandages to the arm and forearm so that the forearm serves instead of splints, if there is no contra-indication and you see no pathological change in the broken bone.	0.8257115
And if you suspect that the bone might move, use splints, and place on the fracture a splint wider and stronger than the others, and have a finger's width of space between each splint, and each splint should be so large that it extends past the fracture by three fingers' widths on each side; then bind over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on fractures, tighter and less often changing the bandages.	But should you fear any such change then use splints. The way to use these is to place over the fracture itself a splint that is broader and stronger than the rest; and leave a space of a finger's breadth between splints; the splint should be of a length to suit the fracture with the addition of three fingers' breadth all round. Then bandage over the splints in the manner mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. That is, you should bandage more tightly over the fracture itself and more lightly as you get away from the fracture.	0.86790526
And if you observe the placement of the splints and the bandaging, as we have said, at the time you set the broken limb, and you are concerned about hot swelling/inflammation, leave it unbound until the seventh day, as we have said; then check the bandaging every three days, that itching or swelling does not occur there, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. Then adjust it, as we have said.	If you decide to put on splints and bandage, as we have said, at the time you set the limb, do so. But if you fear an abscess, leave the splinting and bandaging until the seventh day as we have said. Then examine the bandaging every third day lest there be itching or swelling at the place; or nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb on account of excessively tight bandaging; treat all these in the proper manner according to our prescriptions.	0.9008565
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be completely healed in forty days; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and medicinal ointments to restore the area.	Now it is the nature of the humerus and of the leg to knit in forty days; then they should be loosened and the patient should go to the bath and be treated with suitable ointments.	0.79054797
And if the injury is severe and swollen, wait to unbind it for fifty days or two months.	If the fracture be ugly and contused, do not unfasten it for fifty days or even two months.	0.8421575
