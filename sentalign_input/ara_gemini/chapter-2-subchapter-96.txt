Chapter ninety-six on cupping and how to use it.
Cupping glasses may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass, and cupping is done in two ways: one with incisions and bloodletting, and the other without incisions. This cupping without incisions is done in two ways: either with fire or without fire. Cupping glasses used with incisions and bloodletting have fourteen locations on the body, one of which is the cupping of the naqrah, which is the back of the head; the kahil, which is the middle of the back of the neck; the cupping of the akhda'ayn, which are the two sides of the neck; the cupping of the chin, which is below the lower jaw of the mouth; the cupping of the shoulders; the cupping of the coccyx on the lower back; the cupping of the forearms, which are the middle of the arms; the cupping of the legs; and the cupping of the ankles. Cupping only draws blood from the thin veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason it does not weaken the strength like phlebotomy. Cupping, whether with fire or without fire, should not be used in any of the diseases that result from fullness until the whole body is purged. If there is a need for cupping due to illness or habit, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, and at any time. This is because some people, when their blood increases until they need to remove it by cupping, find heaviness and headaches in their heads. Some find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. Some find itching in their face and side, darkness and a burning sensation in their eyes. Some scratch the location of their cupping. Some laugh a lot. Some find the taste of blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit blood. Some sleep a lot. Some see blood, redness, the slain, wounds, and the like in their sleep. So, whenever we see something like this, especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we order cupping after two or three hours of daylight have passed. As for the benefit of naqrah cupping, it is useful for heaviness in the head and water flowing to the eyes, but this should be after purging the whole body. This cupping may be a substitute for cephalic vein phlebotomy. One should be careful not to use it on someone with a cold brain or who has a cold, as it will harm them greatly. Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly or those with cold diseases in their heads. Whoever persists in it will develop forgetfulness, so you should instruct the cupper to lower his hand with the cupping glass a little downwards for fear of developing forgetfulness. Kahil cupping is a substitute for akhal and basilic vein phlebotomy, and therefore it is useful for asthma, shortness of breath, blockage of the respiratory system, cough, and fullness. Kahil cupping should be raised slightly, because if it is lowered, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach. Cupping of the akhda'ayn is beneficial for headaches, eye inflammation, migraine, diphtheria, and pain in the roots of the teeth, and it is a substitute for basilic vein phlebotomy. You should instruct the cupper not to deepen his hand with the incision, lest he cut an artery and cause bleeding. Cupping under the chin is beneficial for thrush in the mouth, gum disease, and similar diseases in the mouth, and it may replace phlebotomy of the jugular veins in the lips. Cupping of the shoulders is beneficial for palpitations caused by fullness and heat. Cupping of the forearms is beneficial for what benefits phlebotomy of the three veins: basilic, akhal, and cephalic, because it draws blood from all those thin veins in the flesh. These thin veins draw from other thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three thick veins. You should instruct the cupper not to go too deep in the incision, because the area is devoid of flesh and underneath it are nerves and arteries. The single cupping glass that is placed on the coccyx is useful for hemorrhoids and ulcers of the anus. You should instruct the cupper to use a large cupping glass made of copper, because the area needs strong suction, and a glass cupping glass may break and require many incisions. Cupping of the legs significantly reduces fullness, as it draws blood from the whole body, and it is useful for chronic pain in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, and it induces menstruation. It is useful for pimples and boils, and it replaces phlebotomy of the saphenous and ankle veins, except that it greatly weakens the body and causes dizziness in most people. Cupping of the ankles has benefits similar to those of cupping of the legs. The method of applying cupping glasses is to first place the cupping glass empty and apply moderate suction. Do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors flow to the area evenly. Continue to repeat this and follow it until you see that the area has reddened and opened and the redness of the blood has appeared. Then make an incision and reapply suction slowly, then observe the condition of the bodies. For those with loose flesh and porous pores, you should make only one incision, lest the area ulcerate, and instruct the cupper to widen the incision and deepen it slightly and adjust the suction gently with a gentle movement. If the blood is thick, you should make two incisions. In the first incision, open a path for the thin blood and its watery part, and in the second, to complete the removal of the thick blood. If the blood is very turbid, repeat the incision a third time to reach the goal. In general, if we want to remove a little blood, we are satisfied with one incision. If we want to remove a lot of blood, we make more incisions. If we estimate that the blood is thick, we should make a deep incision, and the moderate limit for the incision is the depth of the skin only. What oils and waters should be used when applying cupping glasses, and what the person being cupped should avoid. For those whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and whose pores are narrow, the cupping areas should be anointed with opening, softening, and resolving oils. If it is in the summer, use oils like rose oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil. If it is in the winter, use oils like narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or lily oil, and so on. If the excess humor is thick and cold, use marjoram oil, savory oil, rue oil, or dill oil, and so on. If the person being cupped has wide pores and soft flesh, they should avoid oils. These people should wash their cupping areas after cupping with rose water, cold water, nightshade water, gourd water, purslane water, and so on. If their blood is very moist, they should wash their cupping areas with vinegar or with myrtle and sumac water, and so on. If their excess humors are thick, they should wash their cupping areas with old wine or with marjoram water, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, and so on. Cupping should be avoided in the bath and immediately after the bath, but it should be used one or two hours after leaving the bath. One should not sleep after cupping. What should be done for the person being cupped or phlebotomized before and after cupping. You should first observe. If the person being cupped or phlebotomized is choleric and their blood is predominantly sharp and inflamed, they should take cooling things like pomegranate, chicory with vinegar, lettuce, oxymel, jujube, and so on, and their food should be chickens and lamb meat, vinegar dishes, and verjuice dishes, and so on. If their temperament is cold, they should be given honey drink, mead, or aniseed oxymel, and they should take fragrant medium wine, which is between old and new, and they should be instructed to eat little, and their food should be chickens, partridges, small birds, and baby pigeons, white meat dishes. On the day of cupping and phlebotomy, drink should be more than food. It may be necessary to give some people theriac, musk medicine, or scyllitin at certain times before or after cupping or phlebotomy to strengthen the main organs and thin the blood, but this should not be given to those with hot temperaments. Cupping without incisions is cupping that is placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney area, and hip joint because these organs do not tolerate incisions. The purpose of this is either to draw blood from one organ to another, such as placing the cupping glass on the breasts in the case of nosebleeds, or we use it to resolve a cold wind that has become lodged in the organ, such as placing the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel, as it loosens the organ, warms it, and relieves the pain by resolving that wind. It may be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stone, so that by the strength of its suction, it may open the blockage or remove the stone from its place. It does the same if placed on the liver and spleen when there is a wind disturbing them. These cupping glasses may be used empty with suction only, they may be used with fire, or they may be filled with lukewarm water for diseases of swelling, by filling a large cupping glass with hot water alone or with water in which some suitable herbs have been cooked. Then it is placed full on the area, held, removed, and repeated as needed. This is an image of the cupping glass that is used with fire:
Its mouth opening should be two open fingers, as we have illustrated, and its depth should be half a span.
And on its side, around the middle, there should be a small hole the size of a needle's entry, made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, with a thick rim, smooth, even, and polished so that it does not harm the organ when placed on it.
And in its center, there should be a transverse rod of copper or iron where the candle is placed with fire. This cupping glass can be made larger than what we described, and smaller, depending on the illnesses and age of the user, for the cupping glasses of children and thin people are different from the cupping glasses of men and bulky bodies.
As for how to place this cupping glass with fire on the organ, it is that you light a wick with fire from tightly woven linen or a small candle of pitch and place it on the center of the hardened rod that is in the center of the cupping glass so that the ascent of the fire upwards is towards the bottom of the cupping glass so that the body of the sick person does not burn. Then it is placed on the organ with a finger on the hole that we mentioned so that if we hold the cupping glass, what we need, the finger is removed and the vapor comes out of that hole and the cupping glass is released on the spot.
Then light the wick in the manner described and repeat it if needed.
As for the cupping glass that is used for the illness of shuwsa (a swelling/inflammation) with water, it does not have a hardened rod nor a hole, but rather it is used by filling it with water and placing it on the organ only.
And this is its image:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold much water, the better it is,
