On the method of cauterizing in cases of epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
Epileptics should only be cauterized if their condition is caused by phlegm.
Thus, the brain must first be cleansed with hyeeras and other treatments mentioned in the section on disease division, especially if the patient is an adult or can tolerate medicines.
However, if the patient is a child and cannot tolerate medication, administer gargles and chewing agents that purify the brain over several days along with good dietary practices.
Then, shave his head, and apply one cautery in the middle of the head as previously outlined, one on the back of the head, and one on each corner of the head.
If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, apply cauteries as described for paralysis and body relaxation, along the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, using the olive-shaped cautery as previously described.
For children, however, use a finer cautery, following this approach.
