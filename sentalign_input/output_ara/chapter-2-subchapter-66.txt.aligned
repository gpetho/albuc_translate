On the varicose vein.  This varicose vein, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described for the vein that is with the scrotum, that is, that the vessels should be tied gently below, after the incision on them.	On flatulent hernia. I have not seen anyone pluck up enough courage to attempt the operative treatment of this kind of rupture. The Ancients indeed said it ought to be done in the same way as hernia with varicocele; namely, to ligate the blood-vessels after cutting down upon them, gently, and lower down.	0.79156566
Then it is incised in the middle, and the swelling is treated with what opens it until the vessels fall off, and the wound is treated as we mentioned until it heals.	Then make an incision in the middle and apply to the tumour such things as will keep it open until the blood-vessels fall away. And dress the wound in the manner we have already mentioned until it heals.	0.8227014
