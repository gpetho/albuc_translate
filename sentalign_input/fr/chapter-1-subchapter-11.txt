When because of melancholy the superfluities or moisture are corrupted and thick phlegm, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have said for those with paralysis.
And if because of melancholy the superfluities decline to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink that will cleanse the brain, as we have said before in the division.
Afterward shave the patient's head; then make a ring of linen well made, like a circle, and place it in the middle of the head; and let the patient sit cross-legged and be well held on all sides; then present the liniment, and it is very effective with old sheep butter; and heat it gently over the fire, so that the finger can endure it when dipped; then pour the circle inside the middle of the head, and let it cool; and do this to the patient once a week with other good management, until he is healed.
Or if you want, cauterize by making multiple pricks with the cautery. This manner of cautery moistens the brain evenly; and then apply cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
