of the rupture of the peritoneum
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines descend into the scrotum, and this is recent, it is necessary that when you intend to treat it, he does not eat anything that day; 
and that he uses things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his belly;
afterwards have him sit on his back between your hands, and tell him to hold his breath until the intestines are returned, and put them back with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and also another incision shaped like half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
until it is white and throws off sparks.
Then return the intestines to their place;
and the assistant should hold his hand there so they don't return;
and open the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion under him and an attendant on his thighs, and another on his chest to hold his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you don't reach it the first time, do it again until you reach the bone;
and carefully watch that the intestine does not protrude when you apply the cautery;
so that you do not burn it;
and that because of this the patient does not die, or suffer other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And the cautery for children must be small according to their size, and for adults as large according to their size;
After three days, treat the site of the cautery with butter until the burn is gone;
Afterward, treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound is well closed;
and their food should be cooked for a long time, so that their bowels do not move when they try to go to the toilet.
And after forty days, when they want to get up, apply a well-made support bandage, and wear it for another forty days;
and they should rest well, working little and avoiding overfilling themselves with drink and food, and avoid shouting too loudly;
and when they follow these instructions, they will be completely healed.
And I will discuss the treatment of cutting in its own chapter below.
of the rupture of the abdomen
When ruptures occur in other abdomens and are recognizable, and you see that they are not growing, then make a round cautery according to its size, and burn a third of the core;
afterwards treat it according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery in this shape:
but first mark the location with ink and draw a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside it, and hold your hand in the middle with the cautery firmly in place.
But the first cautery is easier and gentler.
