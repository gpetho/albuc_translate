of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have mentioned before in the divisions of diseases, and it does not help, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned, both with medicine and iron, are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white-hot; and bleed first on the painful spot a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and be careful not to cut the artery and not to reach the bone; and beware of the jaw that moves when eating, and the nerves should not be affected so that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of the bleeding from the artery when it is cut, or cutting is very dangerous, especially for those who do not know about it and who are not studied and experienced; and stop the procedure midway; but I will tell you how to stop the bleeding when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the disease, and the patient is suffering, cauterize the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed; and if you wish, apply the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on artery extraction, with the cautery that has two knives; and this cautery is better and more helpful than the other.
