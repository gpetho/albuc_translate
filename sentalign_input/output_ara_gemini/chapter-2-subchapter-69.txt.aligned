Chapter sixty-nine on castration.	CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE. On castration.	0.8386811
Castration is forbidden in our religion, and therefore I should not have mentioned it in this book, but I have mentioned it for two reasons: one is that it should be in the physician's knowledge if he is asked about it, and that he should know the treatment of whoever is afflicted by it.	Castration is forbidden in our law and I ought therefore to make no mention of it in my book. But I must speak of it for two reasons. One reason is that it should be part of the doctor's medical knowledge when asked about it, and that he should know how to treat anyone whom it befalls.	0.9053154
And the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit, such as lambs, goats, cats, and the like.	Another reason is that often we need to castrate certain animals for the sake of the benefits that accrue from them, such as rams, he-goats and cats, and such animals.	0.904457
So I say that castration is of two types, either by crushing or by incision and cutting.	So I say that castration can be performed in two ways: either by contusion; or by opening up and cutting away.	0.85876775
The one that is done by crushing, the way to do it is that we sit the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften and hang down, then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not discernible to the touch.	The method by contusion is that we make the animal sit in warm water until his testes are relaxed and become soft and pendent; then rub them with your hand until they are so loosened that they are no longer palpable.	0.8618287
As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the spermatic cords and make one incision on each testicle so that when the two testicles emerge, you cut them after skinning them and leave nothing of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels.	As to castration by open operation and excision, the animal should be held and pressure put upon the scrotum with the left hand. Then tie the spermatic cord and with one incision cut down upon both testicles so that both are brought up out of the scrotum. After dissecting them away cut them off; do not leave any of the coverings upon them except the thin membrane covering the vessels.	0.8576635
And this type of castration is better than the one that is by crushing because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires intercourse.	This manner of castration is better than the contusion method, for contusion often leaves something of the testicles, and the animal desires to couple.	0.79242206
Then treat the wound until it heals.	Then dress the wound until healed.	0.90541637
