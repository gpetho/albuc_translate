Sometimes foul pustules, known as Albathir, appear on the body, caused by corrupted, thick humors.	Foul pustules sometimes arise on the body, caused by heavy corrupt frigid matter.	0.73411846
It is necessary, when they first appear, to cauterize the top of each pustule with a fine cautery, such as a myrtle twig with a fire-heated tip. Alternatively, use the root of long Aristolochia (birthwort). Or, you may use a lenticular-shaped cautery.	When they first appear you should cauterize the head of each one lightly with myrtle wood whose tip has been lighted in the fire; or with the root of the long birthwort; or with the lenticular cautery.	0.7591369
Sometimes, early cauterization of these pustules, following this method, prevents them from enlarging, breaks up the excess humor causing them, and brings about healing.	Sometimes furuncles also are cauterized in the same manner when they first arise; then they get no bigger and the superfluity originating them is dispersed and the patient is cured of them.	0.59160185
However, this procedure should be carried out after purging through bloodletting.	But before you cauterize these, the patient must be depleted by bleeding.	0.6546997
