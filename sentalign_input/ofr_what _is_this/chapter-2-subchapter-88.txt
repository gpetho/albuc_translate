Sometimes an abscess arises in a fleshy place, and remains so long that it creates a large collection of pus; and then it breaks and bursts, and the pus comes out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin that is on top is as thin as a thin cloth, and it does not run down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such a disease is called "sain," and is not called "fistula"; but if it is so elongated that it reaches the bone deeply, it is called "fistula"; and the treatment is that you cut off this skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it will not heal because of its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with a clyster thus: see if the sinus is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put them to cook in a vessel on the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey; and then take some of this according to your need, and dissolve it in water and honey, and clysterize the sinus, and close the opening; and leave the medicine inside for two hours, then remove it by squeezing; do this many times, until the sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed; and sometimes it is clysterized with water of ashes, when this medicine is not available, and you should take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over them, then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the sinus is well cleansed; and if the patient cannot bear it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, clysterize it with water and honey with a little ground litharge; or clysterize it with honey and wine mixed, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine makes the sinus heal; and when you have done this, and you are confident that the sinus is well cleansed, clysterize it with that which makes flesh grow in it, and that is that you take diachylon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and wine; or you clysterize it with some medicines and ointments, whose properties I have described in the treatise on ointments; and if the opening of the sinus is small, and the tube of the clyster cannot enter it, widen it a little with an iron, and put in a tent of the Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened; and if the wound is too large, sew it up and leave only one place where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that emits pus is at the top, make the opening in the lowest place there is.
For when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to generate; and if you cannot cut the sinus from below as you would like, prepare it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest place there is, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to generate and if you cannot cut the sinus from below as you would like, prepare it in such a way: that the pus runs easily downwards, and leaves none of the pus behind; and take consolidative medicines to put on the sinus, and spread over it a linen cloth that covers the whole sinus; then forcibly cut the opening of the sinus a little wider than before, then spread a soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it on the opening of the sinus to draw out the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days, once; and the one that is over the opening of the sinus, remove often to remove the pus, and know what runs from the pus, whether it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested; and take note if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been applied in this way and you see that nature is acting on the opening of the sinus, know that the sinus will soon heal, and health is approaching; and then untie it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you untie the wound, apply another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if the sinus emits undigested pus after many days, know that the sinus will not heal.
And if thin venom flows after a long time, do not despair of healing, for health is approaching.
For there are men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and those who do the opposite; and if undigested pus comes from the sinus after many days, know that the sinus will not heal; and if the sinus is slow to heal, and is deep, add medicines that are moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as diachylon ointment, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and it is the last medicine; take diachylon ointment, and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with old wine equal in substance; then thicken it and use it; and the same is better done with cooked fat, when diachylon ointment is not available, or you take myrrh and aloe and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey when it is on the fire; and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it on the sinus, and sometimes administer long birthwort, and roots of celestial lily, which is like vetch flour and centaury; and use simple or compound: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it; and if the treatment is prolonged, and it is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; then treat it with the treatment for fistula, as we have said before.
