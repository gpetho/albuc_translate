The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty, and it dislocates in all directions, especially forward or backward, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is located under the sight and under the touch, in whatever form it is dislocated.	The elbow is with difficulty dislocated and with difficulty put back. Now dislocation may be in all directions, and particularly forward and backward.	0.78347224
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, this will be clear to you with a clear explanation by the concavity of the joint, and he cannot bend his arm nor touch his shoulder with it.	Whatever way it is dislocated it will not be concealed from you, because it is both visible and palpable, and whenever you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one it is quite openly and plainly manifested; for the elbow joint is hollow and the patient cannot flex the forearm back or touch his shoulder with it.	0.6257898
And it is necessary to hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot swelling occurs to it, because if a hot swelling occurs to it, it will be difficult to reduce it, and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backward, because it is the worst of all types of dislocation and the most severe in pain, and death often occurs with it.	You must hasten and reduce the dislocation as rapidly as possible before an abscess occur. For if an abscess occur the reduction of it is difficult and maybe it will never be healed; especially when it is a posterior dislocation, for this is the worst and most painful of all the kinds of dislocation, and often it is fatal.	0.85785884
And its treatment, if it is possible to return it, is that an assistant extends his hand with both his hands and his arm outstretched, and the physician's hands are from above the elbow and from below it, and he pushes the joint with both his thumbs or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.	Now when it is one of those that can be reduced, the way to reduce it is for an assistant to perform a two-handed extension of the patient's hand, the patient's forearm being opened out, while the doctor's hands are above and below the elbow joint and he thrusts the joint with both thumbs together or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.	0.80772334
But if the dislocation is forward, it may be returned by bending the hand suddenly until it strikes with the base of its palm the shoulder that it faces.	If it be an anterior dislocation, it may go back if the hand is bent sharply back until it strikes its own shoulder with the root of the palm.	0.8064793
If the dislocation does not respond to returning, then use very strong and powerful extension, which is that two assistants extend the arm and two assistants hold the patient so that he does not move during the extension, then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide bandage on his hand.	If the dislocation does not respond to reduction, apply very strong and powerful extension. For this, let two assistants pull on the arm while two other assistants hold the patient against the extension. Then the arm should be rotated in all directions after the limb has been wrapped in a long folded cloth or a broad wrapper.	0.9183011
And when the physician handles the joint with his hands, he wipes it with oil so that it helps in sliding the joint easily, then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns.	When the doctor begins manipulating the joint he should anoint his hands with oil so as to assist, by its lubrication, the movement of the joint; then he should thrust the joint powerfully until it goes back.	0.84637046
And after its return, it is necessary to apply a bandage on it that contains astringent and drying properties with egg white, and tighten it firmly, and suspend the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it for days, then loosen it. If the joint is stable in its place, then loosen the bandage from it and leave it.	After its reduction he should apply to it a plaster having some styptic and absorbent qualities, with egg-white; and put on a firm bandage and suspend the patient's arm from his neck and leave it for some days. Then undo it; and if the joint remains fixed in its place, then untie the bandaging and leave it.	0.86245286
And if you see that the joint has not become firm yet, then repeat the bandage and the binding and leave it also for days until it becomes firm, then loosen it.	If you see that the joint is not thoroughly firm, replace the plaster and bandaging and leave it for a few more days until it is firm; then untie it.	0.8370957
If stiffness occurs to it after the return of the joint and its loosening and difficulty in movement, then let him use moisturizing in the bath and gentle massage and rubbing until it softens, or place the tail of a fat ram on the joint, then tie it and leave it on him for a day and a night, then remove it and let him enter the bath. And when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then repeat the tail on him once, twice, and thrice with entering the bath until it softens.	If, after the reduction and unbandaging of the joint, it becomes stiff and is difficult to move, soften it in the bath and apply gentle friction and massage until it is softened, or apply to the joint the tail of a fat-tailed sheep; bind it on and leave it on for a day and a night; then remove it and send him to the bath, and when he sweats apply moderate friction to the joint; then replace the tail and again and again, alternating with the bath, until the joint softens.	0.91625136
And if you want to put on it fresh, soft cow dung with ghee and tighten it on him, do that several times, because it will soften and return to its original state.	If you prefer, apply to it, and bandage on, fresh cow-dung lightened with butter. Do this a number of times and it will soften and return it to its original state.	0.81295
