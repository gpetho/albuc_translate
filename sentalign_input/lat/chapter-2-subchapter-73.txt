On the treatment of hemorrhoids, athehelil, and red bothor in the vulvae of women.
Chapter 73.
Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of the orifices of veins, until much blood flows continually from them.
When hemorrhoids persist, they become thelil; and I have already explained the types of these, and their signs; and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids that are in the orifice of the uterus and are not apparent to the senses: then they are not treated with a surgical instrument.
However, those that are in the orifice of the uterus and are perceived by touch are the ones that are treated.
Therefore, it is necessary to place the woman in a cool room.
Then stretch out the athehelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then sprinkle over them, where the blood flows, some powders of incision that do not cause stinging: such as acacia, dragonâ€™s blood, frankincense, and similar substances.
Then have her press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the blood flow persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rind, galls, and similar ingredients.
Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it to place on her back.
If the bleeding stops with this, it is good; if not, apply suction cups to her back and breasts, without cutting the skin.
Then take wool, and soak it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of plantain, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, wild rose, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the area.
When the swelling subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
The red albarth is similar to the heads of alhaasse and has a rough appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut away what appears of it, as I have explained with the thelil, and treat it until it heals.
