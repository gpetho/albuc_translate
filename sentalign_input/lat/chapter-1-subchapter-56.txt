On the method of cauterizing arterial bleeding from a wound.
Chapter 58.
Arterial bleeding often occurs from an artery cut by an external wound, the incision of an abscess, a limb cauterization, or similar injuries; stopping it can be very difficult.
When this happens, quickly place your index finger over the artery’s opening, press down firmly, and hold to stop blood from escaping.
Then place several olive-sized cauteries, both small and large, in the fire and fan them until they are extremely hot.
Choose a cautery that suits the size and location of the wound, place it over the artery after quickly lifting your finger, and hold it in place until the bleeding stops.
If bleeding resumes when you lift your finger or extinguish the cautery, immediately use another cautery from those prepared in the fire.
Continue using cauteries one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
Take care not to burn any nearby nerve, as this could cause additional harm to the patient.
Know that arterial bleeding, especially from a large artery, cannot be controlled except by one of four methods:
With cautery, as described.
By extraction, if it has not yet been removed.
When it is extracted, the ends contract, stopping the bleeding.
Or by tightly tying it with a thread.
Or apply medicines with properties to halt bleeding, combined with firm compression using a suitable cushion.
Using ligatures, cloth pressure, or applying burning substances seldom offers lasting relief and may not be effective.
If a person is alone without a physician or medical supplies, they should place their index finger over the artery’s opening, pressing firmly to prevent blood flow from the wound above and the artery itself, as previously described.
Do not remove the finger, but continuously pour very cold water over the area to thicken and freeze the blood, stopping the bleeding.
During this process, assess whether further treatment with cautery or medicine is needed.
