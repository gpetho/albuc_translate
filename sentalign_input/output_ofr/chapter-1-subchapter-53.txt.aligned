of the pores/holes that come on the feet Very often it happens that on the outside of the feet a malady arises which is called "nail/corn/boil" according to our understanding, and it is a large, infected thing which hurts the foot.

Cauterization by fire is that you heat a cautery instrument like the quill of a vulture's feather, and it should be made of good iron in such a way that it can enclose the nail/corn/boil on all sides, and that it has thin edges;	The actual cautery is to heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's quill, made of iron, narrow of edge, of such a size as to surround the corn all round.	0.6266005
afterwards put it, all hot, on the nail/corn/boil, and turn your hand all around the nail/corn/boil until it reaches the bottom of the nail/corn/boil; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus; then make a poultice of wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the nail/corn/boil will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.	Then put it, hot, on the corn and rotate it till the cautery reaches the root of the corn; and let be for three days to draw the pus; then apply a plaster of wild mallows ground up with salt, and leave the plaster on one night; then it may be drawn out with its root.	0.8189155
Then treat the area with an ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.	Then treat the site of the wound with stimulating salve till it heals.	0.82269347
Do this one after the other, until you have removed all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.	Treat them in this manner one after another till you have accounted for all of them. Then treat the site of them, after eradication, with stimulating ointments.	0.7266844
