of the flesh that grows on the pupil/surface of the eye
In the eyes of some men sometimes grows red flesh, and it covers the pupil and presses on the eyelids and turns them outwards, and resembles a pomegranate blossom; 
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then you open his eyes, and lift all this flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly;
then cut the first layer of flesh, and continue cutting with the scalpel to the end, and be careful not to injure the eye during the procedure;
and make the incision with the spatula that we mentioned in the incision of the nail and with the small forceps with which the sebum is removed, as the figure after this chapter shows;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt or instill red bile and similar corrosive medicines, and put on the external eye cotton with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and hot blood overcomes you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus you make flesh grow back in the eye by this method.
But nevertheless, you must lighten the treatment of each weak eye in a natural way;
and in the case of an accident, by working with iron; (This likely refers to surgical instruments)
and do not put your hand to any of these works until you see that this member is able to tolerate that work.
