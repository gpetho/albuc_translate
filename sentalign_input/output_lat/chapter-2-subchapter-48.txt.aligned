CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT.	Chapter 48.	0.66966176
These tumours under the armpit are of the type of scrofulous tumours, hard, enclosed in a capsule. Some contain humidity.	These abscesses that occur beneath the Titillicus are of the hard types of Strophulas, which contain cysts, and some of them contain fluids.	0.6666294
Those that contain humidity should be opened with a semicircular incision like this, from b to g. When you have removed all the pus that had been in the tumour, pack the wound with teased-out cotton wool and leave till another day.	Those among them that contain fluids must therefore be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, in this form, from line b. to line g. Then, when everything within the abscess is drained of infection, fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.	0.7578448
Then remove the cotton wool and dress with a suitable ointment until healed.	Then remove the cotton, and treat it with suitable ointment until it heals.	0.93052363
If the tumour be of the nodular scrofulous kind, cut directly down on it just as we prescribed for that kind.	But if the abscess is of the type of Strophula nodes, then incise it above, as we have said in the section on Strophulas.	0.61465645
If the wound continue to discharge pus, apply the cautery to it as prescribed before.	If, however, the wound extends so that it releases pus, then apply cautery to it, as we have discussed previously.	0.77173984
