Cauterization of Chronic Migraine.	On the cauterization of chronic migraine.	0.85843426
If you treat the migraine with the aforementioned treatments mentioned in the sections on diseases and the treatment is not successful, and you see from the illness that it is not sufficiently treated by the aforementioned first cauterization with medication or cauterization by fire. Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it becomes white-hot after you have marked the painful area with a line half a finger long or thereabouts, and you should draw your hand across it once, pulling it tightly until you sever the artery and reach the bone.	When you have treated a migraine in the way we have described and with what we have mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you perceive that the malady is such that the cauterization we have mentioned before does not suffice for it, either with caustic or with the actual cautery, you should heat an edged cautery to white heat after you have marked the place with a line half a finger's breadth long or thereabouts; and impress your hand once and maintain the pressure till you cut down upon the artery and reach the bone.	0.9127877
However, you must be careful to avoid touching the jaw, which moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, which would cause convulsions.	You must be careful of the mandibular joint which moves in chewing, that you do not cut the muscle or tendon that moves it, causing spasm.	0.80244195
And be cautious and attentive regarding the bleeding from the artery that you cut, for there is danger in severing it. Especially for someone who is ignorant of what to do and is not experienced and practiced, it is better to abandon the procedure.	Have the utmost care of haemorrhage from the artery you have cut, for the occurrence of that is dangerous, specially with one who does not know what to do, having no experience or practice; it is better to refrain from operating.	0.8479271
And the management of bleeding arising from the artery will be mentioned in its proper place in the book, God willing. If you see a condition that this cauterization does not address...	We shall later on mention a treatment for accidental haemorrhage of the artery, in due detail, in its proper place in this book.	0.5232959
And if you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle of the head, as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.	But if you see that this cautery is not enough for this disorder and you see that the patient is of bodily fitness for it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound till healed.	0.7339364
And if you wish, use the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on arterial hemorrhage with the two-bladed cautery iron, for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.	If you prefer, employ that cauterization which we have described in the chapter on the extraction of an artery, with the cautery of two blades; for that is a cauterization better and more effective than this.	0.8409755
