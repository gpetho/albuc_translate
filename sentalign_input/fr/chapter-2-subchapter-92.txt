Worms that grow between the skin and flesh
This disease is called in our land "cattle disease", because it often happens to oxen,
and it is a small worm that is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body, rising and descending,
and one can feel it moving from limb to limb, until it tears the skin where it goes, and comes out;
and it is generated from the decay of some humors, just as worms, serpents, lumbrici, and ascarides come in the stomach;
and one fears its malice, because when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and comes to the eye,
sometimes it reenters and destroys the eye; and this happens often.
When you want to cure and draw it, you can only do it when it moves:
so it is necessary to tie the place above and below with a strong tight band,
then cut above and draw it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it,
cauterize it with fire on top, until it dies;
and the greatest harm it does is that it affects the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, press the eyebrow strongly below it, then cut above and draw it out;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with body purifying medicines for the rotten humors,
and avoid foods that generate decay.
