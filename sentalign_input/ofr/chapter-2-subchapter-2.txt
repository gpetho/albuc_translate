of rheum/a cold
When someone experiences an illness called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is chronic, and medical treatment is not effective, then the last resort is cauterization, along with cutting the two arteries.
It is therefore necessary, when you are about to cut them, that the patient tilt their head back;
afterwards rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then have the patient constrict their neck with a cloth;
then observe where the vein pulsates, and the location of each is behind the ears, and a little recessed;
then mark the locations with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp scalpel in two places, so that the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the scalpel under the artery and cut it from above, cutting like two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery cannot be felt, then you must measure the distance of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut to the bone;
and the necessary amount of blood to let out is six hundred (600 ml), and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can tolerate, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound:
if any of the periosteum remains on the bone, cut it so that no abscesses form there, then tighten the wound and bind it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
