Here begins the book of fractures
This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that fools remove themselves from this chapter, because they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read a letter of them; and for this reason science is diminished in our land, for I never found anyone good at it; and I know nothing about it, except through the knowledge of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn the science from them, and through experience, and through the practice of my life; and I have described for you in this chapter what is contained, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two previous chapters.
