On the restoration of the clavicle when it is fractured.
Chapter VI.
The clavicle is most often fractured from the front, near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Either it is fractured and split into two without splinters occurring; this is the easiest type to restore.
Or it occurs with splinters in the bone; this is more difficult to restore.
Or it occurs as a fracture with an accompanying wound.
When the fracture is without a wound, the procedure is to have two assistants present, one to hold support near the fractured clavicle, and the other to extend the neck toward that side.
Then align the fracture with your fingers until it takes its proper shape; let there be no bump or hollow.
If you need more extension, then you should place a ball of cloth or wool under the patient’s armpit, its size according to your needs; extend, raise the clavicle, and press the ball with your hand until you align the fracture as required.
If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outward because it lies too deep, then the patient should be laid back on their neck, and you should place a medium-sized pillow under their shoulder, and the assistant should press down on their shoulder until the clavicle bone, which is deep, rises upward; then set the fracture and align it with your fingers.
If you feel a splinter in the clavicle and it moves, then you should make an incision over it and carefully remove the splinter.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then proceed with the incision using one of the chisels you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the clavicle an instrument called a “sifach support,” which is a tool made of wood or iron.
And this is its shape.
It resembles a spoon without a concavity.
Its width should match what you need, depending on the size and thickness of the bone.
Its length should be as long as is practical for the procedure.
It has two ends, as you see: one end is wide, and the other narrow.
If the wound you incised to remove the bone splinter is wide, and you are free from concern about a hot swelling, then bring together the two edges of the wound with a suture.
If the wound is small or you fear a hot swelling, then fill the wound with cloths and small pads according to the size of the wound incision.
If a hot swelling occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it over the area.
If the bone needs setting without a wound and without an incision, place over the bone a plaster made of millstone flour with egg white.
And place soft tow over it.
Then place a ball under the armpit if you need it.
Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel held by the Saracens, which is very long and about the width of a palm or close to it.
Then place a folded pad over the tow and plaster.
Then take a splint made from a thin board, about three fingers wide and of similar length.
Then wrap it in cloth.
Then wrap that cloth and splint in place with the himematem over the fracture site and location.
Then place the himematem over the fracture as it wraps around, and wind it over the patient’s neck, under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit; adjust it around so that the binding holds the fracture in a fitting way. This is what will ensure the splint is not removed from above the fractured bone.
For this reason, you must check the patient every day.
Whenever the bandage loosens and you see the splint has already shifted, then adjust it and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's sleep on his back, and place a small cushion under his head near his sleep at night, so that his support is lifted from his side with him.
Thus, the fracture of the collarbone is raised by the elevation of the shoulder.
Or tie his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the binding, unless an irritation or swelling occurs at the place, for up to twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see his face inclined toward it.
And add to the compression, and leave it until it heals and hardens.
And indeed, the fracture of the collarbone is generally secured and strengthened in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some people in less time.
