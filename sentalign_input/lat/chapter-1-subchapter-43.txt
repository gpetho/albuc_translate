On the method of cauterizing in the initial stage of hunchback.
Chapter 45.
This disease often occurs in young children.
And the sign of its onset in children is that they suffer tightness in breathing upon lifting and movement: and you find at the end of the spine and its joints, that one part has already started to protrude above the other vertebrae.
When you see that, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery shaped like a circle, in this manner.
And let the cautery take hold evenly on every part of the vertebra: and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two lines, or three, with the points close together.
Then treat the area until it heals with what we have prescribed.
And be careful not to apply cautery to a hump caused by nerve spasm.
