of the burns that come on the seam/joint
We often see, after the healing of a fracture, especially when it is near the joint, an ugly thing to see in the shape of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care then if the knot is fresh: administer to it styptic medicines, such as aloe, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and other similar ones, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and cook them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and put them on at night in cloths, and bind it tightly, and do not untie it for several days; and then untie it, and start again, until the nodule is removed; or you tighten over it a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs; and if the nodule has already turned into a hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, cut over it, and remove the apparent excess; or you send it to a barber/surgeon, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
