On the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization helps to control moisture and coldness over the brain: which are two causes of headaches, and excessive flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and excess sleep, and tooth pain, and throat pain; and generally all illnesses that arise from cold, such as paralysis, headaches, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is to instruct the patient: first to be purged with a cleansing medicine for the head over three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and usual condition of the patient.
Then instruct him to have his head shaved with a razor.
Then make him sit upright between your hands, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes.
Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery tool: which has this form.
Then place it on the spot marked with ink, with a downward motion, gradually applying pressure with your hand, and rotate it.
Then lift your hand quickly, and examine the spot.
If you see that an area the size of an alkiel seed or a zeuherb seed has been exposed to the bone, then lift your hand.
If not, repeat the process with the same tool, or another one if it has cooled, until the bones I told you of are visible.
Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a piece of cloth in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it there for three days.
Then place over it a cloth soaked in butter, and leave it on the spot until the burn scab is removed.
Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it heals.
They have said that the longer the wound remains open, the more pus it discharges: thus it is better and more beneficial.
Some of them said to cauterize the skin down to the bone: and hold the cautery until some thickness of the bone is burnt.
Then shave off the part of the bone that has been burnt, then treat it.
Others say that it is necessary to go to the end with the cautery, so that it makes a strong impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, forming something like the shape of a kirate, or like the instrument women use with small carved letters, believing that the head vapors escape from this spot, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals.
To me, however, these two forms of cautery do not seem advisable, except in certain people as a last resort.
In my view, leaving it as it is, is better for his well-being.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural integrity, as we have observed in other limbs, especially when the head of the patient is naturally weak: and the first form of cautery is indeed safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore, perform it with care for health.
